    <head>Sex supplement doesn’t quite hit the spot</head>
    <body>Writing about sex for “the first time”, one of the contributors to your special supplement on “How to have a healthy sex life” (22 April) wrote: “Remember, it’s the first time – it doesn’t have to be the best time.” The supplement made for some interesting reading. But I think the above advice could also be applied to the special issue itself. Of all the articles included in the supplement, only three were written by men. The majority of the articles were about sex in heterosexual relationships. Only one (other than the introductory article, in passing) discussed sex in gay relationships, and not one specifically discussed sex between senior citizens. Well, hopefully it will be better next time. Philip C Stenning Eccleshall, Staffordshire • I had to check that the article I read on 23 April 2023 about having a healthy sex life was not an accidental throwback to a vintage 1950s piece, with its lack of inclusivity for women past their “early 60s”. Apparently we have “significant loss of libido” thereafter, and require no further mention. It was as though modern HRT doesn’t exist, nor barriers knocked down that had previously assumed sexually active lives of older women unseemly and unmentionable. Hello! Here we are. Mary Vine Ryde, Isle of Wight • I’m relieved that at 74 going on 75, I don’t have to worry about sexting, threesomes, one‑night stands, inventive tongues or my libido, but thanks for the memories. Sam White Lewes, East Sussex • I lost my sex life a very long time ago. So long ago, in fact, that I really can’t remember if I ever had one. Stefan Badham Portsmouth, Hampshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section.</body>

    <head>Anglican groups revolt against same-sex blessing plan</head>
    <body>Conservative clergy and parishioners have launched a small but vocal revolt against the Church of England’s plan to offer to bless the civil marriages of same-sex couples, a move that some Christians believe is contrary to biblical teaching. In Buckinghamshire, a large group parish plans to refuse to offer blessings to same-sex couples in its seven churches and is taking steps to withhold its annual contribution of £235,000 to the diocese of Oxford in protest. A group of traditionalist clergy in the City of London have unilaterally formed an independent structure within the C of E as an act of “resistance” to blessings. The actions are backed by the Church of England Evangelical Council (CEEC), a conservative body that has pledged to resist all attempts to introduce church blessings to same-sex couples, known as prayers of love and faith, this year. The CEEC is encouraging churches in all dioceses to make protests, and claims opposition is growing. After years of bitter divisions over sexuality, the C of E’s governing body, the General Synod, voted by 250 to 181 in February to back a proposal by bishops to offer blessings on a voluntary basis for clergy. Traditionalists insist marriage can only be between a man and a woman, and that the plan to bless same-sex marriages is a departure from biblical orthodoxy. Since the synod vote, conservative archbishops in Nigeria, Uganda, South Sudan and Egypt have warned of radical action against the “blessing of sin”. In Buckinghamshire, Great Chesham parochial church council (PCC) voted last month to support local clergy who refuse to bless same-sex marriages. Some parishioners fear the PCC’s stance means gay couples will be unable to find a church willing to bless their civil marriage in the town and surrounding villages. The £235,000 that Great Chesham pays annually to the diocese to cover clergy salaries and other costs represents about 1.2% of the diocese’s annual budget of £19.4m. The PCC voted last month in favour of withholding the payment but must rerun the process after failing to comply with church rules. Three other parishes in the diocese are thought to be considering similar moves. Edward Bowes-Smith, the team rector of Great Chesham parish, said the PCC had “voted to support its clergy who, on grounds of good conscience, have opted not to use prayers of love and faith. We are also in the process of consulting PCC members about setting up an overdue review of our finances.” Alan Wilson, a suffragan bishop in the diocese, said only a handful of churches shared the views of the Great Chesham PCC, stressing that services of blessing were voluntary. “Those who want to can do so, while those who don’t are exactly where they always were. Nothing has changed for them at all.” A spokesperson for the diocese of Oxford said: “We have not been advised of any move to cancel the parish share payments by the [Great Chesham] PCC, though we are aware that there are discussions under way.” In London, 10 conservative priests who oppose church blessings for same-sex couples have unilaterally set up an independent “deanery chapter”. In a video announcing the move, Phil Martin, a vicar at St Botolph’s Aldersgate, who was elected by the group as area dean, said: “Since the [bishops have] departed from the bible’s teaching on marriage and sin … change is needed. New structures are needed.” They invited support from “all clergy who are compelled to resist … on the grounds that [the bishops’] proposed prayers of love and faith undermine the C of E’s doctrine of marriage such that we can no longer walk in partnership together.” In response, the diocese of London said in a statement that the group was “seeking to set up its own parallel, unregulated structures outside of those of the diocese of London and the Church of England. This unilateral move would have no legal substance.” John Dunnett, the director of strategy and operations at the CEEC, said: “The bishops’ proposals neither satisfy those who want to see equal marriage in the C of E, nor those who want to maintain the biblical and historical position.” The CEEC was encouraging churches to take “appropriate” action, he said. “The key thing is for bishops to know that opposition is profound, widespread and growing.” Jayne Ozanne, a campaigner for LGBT+ equality in the C of E, said: “The synod’s decision to enable blessings of people in same-sex unions upheld the long-established Anglican tradition of freedom of conscience, meaning that none of this small handful of clergy would have been impacted anyway. “If they want to set up their own structures then they should remove themselves from established ones – they can’t have their cake and eat it.”</body>

    <head>Animal review – candid comedy drama explores sex and disability</head>
    <body>Any Grindr user faces a barrage of questions. Top or bottom? 420? Pics? Fun? Host? To these, the candid comedy-drama Animal adds another: “Do you have level access for a wheelchair?” David (Christopher John-Slater) has cerebral palsy but that doesn’t mean he isn’t gagging for it. He is 25 and dismayed that his carers can’t bear to ask whether his virginity is still intact (it is), so in desperation he downloads the ubiquitous gay hook-up app. After initial worries – how can he reveal his vital statistics when he can’t hold a ruler? – he is soon sending devil emojis and dick pics with the best of them. One of the strengths of Jon Bradfield’s play (from a story by Bradfield and Josh Hepple) is that David’s cherry is dispensed with briskly; in no time at all, he is accumulating notches on his bed-post. This necessitates video projection by Matt Powell and swift scene changes on Gregor Donnelly’s set of sliding panels and neon tubes. Multiple parts are shared among the six-strong cast. William Oxborrow is especially deft in a string of roles including, most provocatively, the infantilising brute who tells David to “be good for daddy” and then David’s actual father, bemused by his son’s sex life. John-Slater takes the hairpin bends of David’s emotional landscape with impressive grace, capturing the extremes of elation and despair that characterise the Grindr experience. Nowhere is he funnier than when feigning nonchalance as he persuades a friend’s lover to lend a hand after a series of thwarted assignations. As in Ryan O’Connell’s similarly themed Netflix series Special, the writing gets richer the more selfish, rash or unreasonable our hero becomes. Only during a speech by one of his carers about the frustrations of being differently abled does the material veer into worthiness. The baggy first act could also survive a trim; too long is spent on the carers’ lives, and on demonstrating that David is not the only one with issues. He is, however, the indisputable font of dramatic energy in Bronagh Lagan’s production. When one lover tells him, “You make me want to stick around and see what happens,” we know the feeling. • Animal is at Park theatre, London, until 20 May.</body>

    <head>Golden Age by Wang Xiaobo review – sex, death and politics</head>
    <body>During the Cultural Revolution, children killed parents, lives were broken irrevocably, millions were beaten and starved to death – and Wang Xiaobo wrote an erotic comic novel about it all. Now one of China’s most popular modern writers, Wang was completely unknown when he released Golden Age in Taiwan in 1992; now it is available for the first time in complete form in a sparky, earthy translation by the young Chinese American translator Yan Yan. Wang wrote prolifically, torrentially, for the next five years, scandalising the authorities and titillating the public, until his death in 1997, when his novels moved from black-market editions to more freely disseminated, semi-sanctioned copies. Married to the prominent sexologist and LGBTQ+ rights campaigner Li Yinhe, he spent the mid-80s in Pittsburgh as a postgrad student, returning to China as a part-time history professor, and this may explain his writing’s mass appeal – a hip, jaded insider-outsider, far removed from the reverential, government-approved tragic realist school of Cultural Revolution novels (noble parents, infant mortality, sacrificial animal metaphors). Readers were shocked, outraged, appalled – and have since devoured his work in their millions, just as they have continually asked how it was allowed to be published at all. “A little bit of criticism here and there sharpens one’s moral compass.” So says Wang’s stand-in protagonist Wang Er, who is sent down to rural Yunnan in the late 1960s and begins his story on his 21st birthday. He is a boy of “average talent, dexterous hands, and a very muddled character”. His days involve hunting for extra food, sexual liaisons, menial subsistence farm work and being publicly abused to foster a sense of community. It sounds like heaven. Wang agrees, partly sincerely – life during the Cultural Revolution may be “a slow, drawn-out process of getting your balls crushed”, but it’s his Golden Age, better than the stultifying, unsurely liberalising, globalising world he haunts in the latter part of the novel. Wang indulges in sex, sensuality and nakedness as a deliberate rejection of bureaucratic Maoism and the young, sexless, amorphously green-jacketed Red Guards that formed the shock troops of the early Cultural Revolution, with their denunciatory posters and executions of the traitorously old doctors, scientists and professors who had betrayed the People’s Revolution. One can only wonder what Xi Jinping, a year younger than Wang and with a similarly brutal young adulthood in Shaanxi, made of this novel. Wang’s female partner in crime, the doctor Chen Qingyang, is told to “suffer a little more indignity” in her struggle sessions, as she enjoys showing off her beauty too much. A sense of tragicomic futility and going-through-the-motions abound, tempered with a few hysterically bloody execution-beatings. In the second and third parts, Wang is a biology professor, at first unhappily married, then more unhappily divorced, “lackadaisical at work, and reprehensible in everyday life”. Here, Wang the author perfects his part scatological satire, part deeply moving exposé of the brutality of his youth, to portray life in the emotionally deadened, economically dying 1980s communist state. You can feel the weight of every one of the 20 years it took Wang – who was an eyewitness to Tiananmen Square – to birth the book. The emotional centre of the novel, the suicide of a professor during the Cultural Revolution, his family keeping silent vigil over his brains lacing the uncleaned Beijing pavement, is a masterpiece of understatement. This is frank, irreverent, bawdy, freewheeling, bizarrely moving writing about politics and sex and death. Yes, maybe a little too much of the narrative describes shapely buttocks and perfect breasts and inopportune postmortem erections. Yes, it can be a bit Confessions of a Sent-Down Chinese Student at times. But Wang is a major, epochal Chinese writer, the vast majority of his work untranslated, and if there is going to be a second cold war, with Yellow Scares, denunciations, state-led deniable pogroms of east Asians from western public life, then it’s exactly this kind of book – deeply human, gloriously alive – that we can wave in the face of the social media panopticon state. It won’t matter, of course. We are herd creatures. We have mortgages to pay. You don’t want to be cancelled, do you? • Golden Age by Wang Xiabo and translated by Yan Yan is published by Penguin Classics (£18.99).

    <head>How Facebook and Instagram became marketplaces for child sex trafficking</head>
    <body>Maya Jones* was only 13 when she first walked through the door of Courtney’s House, a drop-in centre for victims of child sex trafficking in Washington DC. “She was so young, but she was already so broken by what she’d been through,” says Tina Frundt, the founder of Courtney’s House. Frundt, one of Washington DC’s most prominent specialists in countering child trafficking, has worked with hundreds of young people who have suffered terrible exploitation at the hands of adults, but when Maya eventually opened up about what she had been through, Frundt was shaken. Maya told Frundt that when she was 12, she had started receiving direct messages on Instagram from a man she didn’t know. She said the man, who was 28, told her she was really pretty. According to Frundt, Maya told her that after she started chatting with the man, he asked her to send him naked photos. She told Frundt that he said he would pay her $40 for each one. He seemed kind and he kept giving Maya compliments, which made her feel special. She decided to meet him in person. Then came his next request: “Can you help me make some money?” According to Frundt, Maya explained that the man asked her to pose naked for photos, and to give him her Instagram password so that he could upload the photos to her profile. Frundt says Maya told her that the man, who was now calling himself a pimp, was using her Instagram profile to advertise her for sex. Before long, sex buyers started sending direct messages to her account, wanting to make a date. Maya told Frundt that she had watched, frozen, what was taking place on her account, as the pimp negotiated prices and logistics for meetings in motels around DC. She didn’t know how to say no to this adult who had been so nice to her. Maya told Frundt that she hated having sex with these strangers but wanted to keep the pimp happy. One morning three months after she first met the man, Frundt says that Maya was found by a passerby lying crumpled on a street in south-east DC, half-naked and confused. The night before, Maya told her, a sex buyer had taken her somewhere against her will, and she later recalled being gang-raped there for hours before being dumped on the street. “She was traumatised, and blamed herself for what happened. I had to work with her a lot to help her realise this was not her fault,” said Frundt when we visited Courtney’s House last summer. Frundt, who has helped hundreds of children like Maya since she opened Courtney’s House in 2008, says that the first thing she now does when a young person is referred to her is to ask for their Instagram handle. Other social media platforms are also used to exploit the young people in her care, but she says Instagram is the one that comes up most often. In the 20 years since the birth of social media, child sexual exploitation has become one of the biggest challenges facing tech companies. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the internet is used by human traffickers as “digital hunting fields”, allowing them access to both customers and potential victims, with children being targeted by traffickers on social media platforms. The biggest of these, Facebook, is owned by Meta, the tech giant whose platforms, which also include Instagram, are used by more than 3 billion people worldwide. In 2020, according to a report by US-based not-for-profit the Human Trafficking Institute, Facebook was the platform most used to groom and recruit children by sex traffickers (65%), based on an analysis of 105 federal child sex trafficking cases that year. The HTI analysis ranked Instagram second most prevalent, with Snapchat third. Grooming and child sex trafficking, though often researched and discussed together, are distinct acts. “Grooming” refers to the period of manipulation of a victim prior to their exploitation for sex or for other purposes. “Child sex trafficking” is the sexual exploitation of a child specifically as part of a commercial transaction. When the pimp was flattering and chatting with Maya, he was grooming her; when he was selling her to other adults for sex, he was trafficking. Though people often think of “trafficking” as the movement of victims across or within borders, under international law the term refers to the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain labour, or in the buying and selling of non-consensual sex acts, whether or not travel is involved. Because, under international law, children cannot legally consent to any kind of sex act, anyone who profits from or pays for a sex act from a child – including profiting from or paying for photographs depicting sexual exploitation – is considered a human trafficker. Tina Frundt, the founder of Courtney’s House. Photograph: Melissa Lyttle/The Guardian Meta has numerous policies in place to try to prevent sex trafficking on its platforms. “It’s very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder, wrote in a memo to staff in 2021. In a statement responding to a detailed list of the allegations in this piece, a Meta spokesperson said: “The exploitation of children is a horrific crime – we don’t allow it and we work aggressively to fight it on and off our platforms. We proactively aid law enforcement in arresting and prosecuting the criminals who perpetrate these grotesque offences. When we are made aware that a victim is in harm’s way, and we have data that could help save a life, we process an emergency request immediately.” The statement cited the group director of intelligence at the charity Stop the Traffik, who is former deputy director of the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency, who has said “millions are safer and traffickers are increasingly frustrated” because of their work with Meta. But over the past two years, through interviews, survivor testimonies, US court documents and human trafficking reporting data, we have heard repeated claims that Facebook and Instagram have become major sales platforms for child trafficking. We have interviewed more than 70 sources, including survivors and their relatives, prosecutors, child protection professionals and content moderators across the US in order to understand how sex traffickers are using Facebook and Instagram, and why Meta is able to deny legal responsibility for the trafficking that takes place on its platforms. While Meta says it is doing all it can, we have seen evidence that suggests it is failing to report or even detect the full extent of what is happening, and many of those we interviewed said they felt powerless to get the company to act. The survivors * * * Courtney’s House sits on a quiet residential street on the outskirts of Washington DC. Inside, Frundt and her team have tried to make the modest two-storey house feel like a family home, with comfortable sofas and photos on the mantlepiece. Frundt, who was herself trafficked as a child in the 1980s and 90s, is now one of Washington DC’s most experienced and respected anti-trafficking advocates. Warm and ferociously protective of the children in her care, she is contracted by the city’s child protection services to identify trafficked children going through the court system, and she regularly attends court hearings for the youth in her care. She also helps train the FBI and local law enforcement sex-trafficking units on how to spot traffickers on online platforms, including Instagram. “When I was trafficked long ago I was advertised in the classified sections of freesheet newspapers,” Frundt told us. “Now my youth here are trafficked on Instagram. It’s exactly the same business model but you just don’t have to pay to place an ad.” The children who are referred to Frundt, usually by the police or social services, have been sexually exploited and controlled: by a boyfriend, a pimp, a family member. Some of them are as young as nine. Almost without exception, they have childhoods scarred by sexual abuse, poverty and violence. This makes them perfect targets for sexual predators. “They are all looking for love and affirmation and a sense that they mean something,” said Frundt. Almost all the young people who come to Courtney’s House are children of colour. They are, Frundt said, battling stereotypes that pressure them to become sexualised too early and make them vulnerable to traffickers. A 2017 study by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality found that adults typically regard Black girls as less innocent and more knowledgable about sex than their white peers. The same study showed that Black girls are often perceived to be older than they are. Most of the time, Frundt says, the children who come to Courtney’s House are still being trafficked when they walk through the door. Even in cases where they have escaped their exploiters, she said, explicit videos and photos of them often continue to circulate online. Traffickers will lock victims out of their accounts, preventing them from taking down images posted to their profiles. When we asked Frundt if she could show us examples of young people in her care who she says are currently being trafficked on Instagram, she pulled out her phone and scrolled through post after post of explicit images and videos of girls as young as 14 or 15. Most of the photos and videos seemed to have been taken by someone else. Frundt said that these posts were being used as a way of advertising the girls for potential sex buyers, who would send a direct message to buy explicit content or to arrange a meet up. At one point, our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of five teenage girls. They had come back from school, and they gathered around the kitchen table, chatting and playing music on their phones while Frundt served them casserole. After they had eaten, we asked if we could talk to them about their experiences: had any of them been sexually exploited on social media or had explicit videos or pictures posted of them? They glanced at each other and burst out laughing. Yes, they said, of course. All the time. One girl said she felt that “nobody at Instagram cares, they don’t care what’s posted. They don’t care shit about us.” Frundt claims that she is constantly asking Instagram to close accounts and take down exploitative content of kids in her care. “I even have law enforcement calling me up asking, ‘Tina, can you get Instagram to do something?’. If I can’t get Instagram to act, what hope is there for anyone else?” When we put these concerns to Meta, a spokesperson said: “We take all allegations and reports of content involving children extremely seriously and have diligently responded to requests from Courtney’s House. Our ability to remove content or delete accounts requires sufficient information to determine that the content or user violates our policies.” Frundt says that in 2020 and 2021 she had discussions with Instagram about conducting staff training to help prevent child trafficking on its platforms. She says the training didn’t go ahead as, after a long back and forth, on a video call Instagram executives said that they wouldn’t pay Frundt her standard fee of $3,000, instead allegedly offering $300. When we put this to Meta, they did not deny it. The court documents and the prosecutors * * * What makes social media platforms so powerful as a tool for traffickers – far more powerful than the back pages of a newspaper in which Frundt was advertised as a teenager – is the way that they make it possible to identify and cultivate relationships with both victims and potential sex buyers. Traffickers can advertise and negotiate deals by using different features of the same platform: sellers sometimes post publicly about the girls they have available, and then switch to private direct messages to discuss prices and locations with buyers. US court documents provide a graphic insight into how these platforms can be used. In one case prosecuted in Arizona in 2019, Mauro Veliz, a 31-year-old who was convicted of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a child, exchanged messages on Facebook Messenger with Miesha Tolliver, who also received jail time for sex trafficking. Tolliver told Veliz that she had one girl available for sex, and photographs of two more, before saying that the girls were aged 17, 16 and 14. Veliz: “How much is it for all of them?” Tolliver: “The 14 [year-old] will cost the most … a couple of hundred for her but [$] 150 for the rest” The 14-year-old, Tolliver told Veliz, was “new to the sex game”. Tolliver: “The 1 on the right … is 16 with a fat ass ... the other [is] 15 with huge tits” The court transcripts then state that multiple sexually explicit images of the girls were sent to Veliz. Tolliver: “do you want me to bring 1 of the girls with me so you guys can fuck?” [ ... ] Veliz: “is your girl nervous? Or have you told her yet?” Tolliver: “… shes still young and doesn’t understand how ppl like it” Tolliver and Veliz exchanged more messages, arranging for Veliz to meet the girl in a hotel in California two days later. The final message submitted to the court was from Veliz to Tolliver. “We’re finished she’s in the restroom,” it said. Luke Goldworm, a former assistant district attorney in Boston, Massachusetts, who has investigated and prosecuted human trafficking cases for years, says that he has encountered numerous exchanges like this one. From 2019 until he left the job in October 2022, he said, his department’s caseload of child-trafficking crimes on social media platforms increased by about 30% each year. “We’re seeing more and more people with significant criminal records move into this area. It’s incredibly lucrative,” he said. A trafficker can make up to $1,000 a night. Many of the victims he saw were just 11 or 12, he said, and most of them were Black, Latinx or LGBTQI+. According to Goldworm, while his investigations involved every social media platform, Meta platforms were the ones he encountered most often. Six other prosecutors in several different states told us that, in their experience, Facebook and Instagram are being widely used to groom children and traffick children. Five of these prosecutors spoke of their anger over what they felt were Meta’s unnecessary delays in complying with judge-signed warrants and subpoenas needed to gather evidence on sex trafficking cases. “We get a higher rate of rejected warrants from Facebook than any other electronic service provider,” claimed Gary Ernsdorff, senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County, Washington state. “What I find frustrating is that the exchange can delay rescuing a victim by a month.” Three of these prosecutors described experiences where they say the company would cite technicalities, picking faults with wording and format, and slowing down investigations. In response, the company said that these claims were “false”, adding that between January and June last year, it “provided data in nearly 88% of requests from the US government”. The responsibility for reporting * * * Meta acknowledges that human traffickers use its platforms, but insists that it is doing everything in its power to stop them. By law, the company is required to report any child sexual abuse imagery shared over its platforms to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), which receives federal funding to act as a nationwide clearing house for leads about child abuse. Meta is a major funder of NCMEC, and holds a seat on the company’s board. From January to September 2022, Facebook reported more than 73.3m pieces of content under “child nudity and physical abuse” and “child sexual exploitation” and Instagram reported 6.1m. “Meta leads the industry in using the most sophisticated technology to detect both known and previously unknown child exploitation content,” said a company spokesperson. Of the 34m pieces of child sexual exploitation content removed from Facebook and Instagram in the final three months of 2022, 98% was detected by Meta itself. But the vast majority of the content that Meta reports falls under child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) – which includes photos and videos of pornographic content – rather than sex trafficking. Unlike with child sexual abuse imagery, there is no legal requirement to report child sex trafficking, so NCMEC must rely on all social media companies to be proactive in searching for and reporting it. This legal inconsistency – the fact that child sexual abuse imagery must be reported, but reporting child sex trafficking is not legally required – is a major problem, says Staca Shehan, vice-president of the analytical services division at NCMEC. “It’s concerning across the board how little trafficking is being reported,” Shehan says. Social media companies “are prioritising what’s [legally] required”. “I think everyone could do more,” Shehan says. “The volume of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and volume of trafficking [being reported] is like apples and oranges.” According to Shehan, one further reason for this disparity, beyond the differing legal requirements, is technological. “Child sexual abuse material is that much easier to detect. There are so many technology tools that have been developed that allow for the automated detection of that crime.” A NCMEC spokesperson told us that if social media companies are not reporting child sex trafficking, it allows this crime to thrive online. Reporting trafficking, they emphasised, is crucial for rescuing victims and punishing offenders. Between 2009 and 2019, Meta reported just three cases as suspected child sex trafficking in the US to NCMEC, according to records disclosed in a subpoena request seen by the Guardian. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg in Washington DC in 2019. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA A spokesperson for NCMEC confirmed this figure, but clarified that a number of child trafficking cases during the same time period were reported by Meta under other “incident types”, such as child pornography or enticement. “I think one of the things to be aware of is that is that there’s sort of a singular tag that’s used for reporting,” Antigone Davis, head of global safety at Meta, emphasised to us in a recent interview. “And so just because something isn’t tagged as sex trafficking doesn’t mean that it isn’t being reported.” A Meta spokesperson claimed that over the past decade, the company had reported “tens of thousands of accounts which violated our policies against child sex trafficking and commercial child sexual abuse material to NCMEC.” When we put these claims to NCMEC, it said that it had not received “tens of thousands” of reports of child trafficking from Meta, but had received that number related to child abuse imagery. Hany Farid is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who helped invent the PhotoDNA technology that Meta uses to identify harmful content. He believes Meta, which is currently valued at more than $500bn, could do more to combat child trafficking. It could, for instance, be investing more to develop better tools to “flag suspicious words and phrases on unencrypted parts of the platform – including coded language around grooming,” he said. “This is, fundamentally, not a technological problem, but one of corporate priorities.” (There is a separate debate about how to handle encryption. Meta’s plans to encrypt direct messages on Facebook Messenger and Instagram has recently drawn criticism from law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Interpol.) In response to Farid’s claims and further questions from the Guardian, Meta did not specify how much money it has invested in technologies to detect child sex trafficking, but said that it had “focused on using AI and machine learning on non-private, unencrypted parts of its platforms to identify harmful content and accounts and make it easier for people to report messages to the company so we can take action, including referrals to law enforcement”. Davis also emphasised that Meta constantly works with partners to improve its anti-trafficking safeguards. For instance, she mentioned that “we’ve been able to identify the kinds of searches that people do when they’re searching for trafficking content, so that when people search for that, we will pop up with information to divert them or to let them know that what they’re doing is illegal activity”. These efforts have failed to satisfy some of Meta’s own investors. In March, several pension and investment funds that own Meta stock launched legal action against the company in Delaware over its alleged failure to act on “systemic evidence” that its platforms are facilitating sex trafficking and child sexual exploitation. By offering insufficient explanation of how it is tackling these crimes, the complaint says, the board has failed to protect the interests of the company. Meta has rejected the basis for the lawsuit. “Our goal is to prevent people who seek to exploit others from using our platform,” the company said. The moderators * * * As well as software, Meta uses teams of human moderators to identify cases of child grooming and sex trafficking. Until recently, Anna Walker* worked the night shift in an office of a Meta subcontractor. She would start each shift filled with dread. “We were just, like, shoved in a dark room to look at the stuff,” she said. Walker’s job was to review interactions between adults and children on Facebook Messenger and Instagram direct messenger that had been flagged as suspicious by Meta’s AI software. Walker claims she and her team struggled to keep pace with the huge backlog of cases. She says she saw cases of adults grooming children and then making plans to meet them for sex, as well as discussions about payment in exchange for sex. Walker’s managers would pass on such cases to Meta to decide if action should be taken against the user. In some cases, Walker claims: “Months would pass and then the automatic bot would send me an email saying it was closing this case, because nobody’s taken action on it.” She added: “I would cry to my manager about [the children I saw] and how I want to help. But it felt like nobody would pay attention to these horrible things.” We talked to six other moderators who worked for companies that Meta subcontracted between 2016 and 2022. All made similar claims to Walker. Their efforts to flag and escalate possible child trafficking on Meta platforms often went nowhere, they said. “On one post I reviewed, there was a picture of this girl that looked about 12, wearing the smallest lingerie you could imagine,” said one former moderator. “It listed prices for different things explicitly, like, a blowjob is this much. It was obvious that it was trafficking,” she told us. She claims that her supervisor later told her no further action had been taken in this case. When we put these claims to Meta, a spokesperson said that moderators such as Walker do not typically get feedback on whether their flagged content has been escalated. They stressed that if a moderator does not hear back about a flagged case, that does not mean no action has been taken. Five of the moderators claimed that it was harder to get cases escalated or content taken down if it was posted on closed Facebook groups or Facebook Messenger. Meta “would be less stringent about something taking place behind ‘closed doors’,” claimed one team leader. “With Messenger, we really couldn’t make any moves unless the language and content was really obvious. If it was four guys who trusted each other and it was in a group it could just live on for ever.” Meta said these allegations “appear to be misleading and inaccurate” and said it uses technology to find child sexualisation content in private Facebook groups and on Messenger. Former Facebook data scientist Frances Haugen speaking at a Senate hearing on consumer protection, product safety and data security in Washington DC in 2021. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP In 2021, former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that seem to support the moderators’ claims. These documents, which numbered thousands of pages, detailed how the company managed harmful content. In one memo from the Haugen leak, the company states that “Messenger groups with less than 32 people should be treated with a full expectation of privacy”. Matias Cruz*, who worked as a content moderator from 2018 to 2020, reviewing Spanish-language posts on Facebook, believes that the criteria that Meta was using to recognise trafficking was too narrow to keep up with traffickers, who would constantly switch codewords to avoid detection. According to Cruz, traffickers would say: “‘I have this cabra [Spanish for goat] for sale,’ and it’d be some really ridiculous price. Sometimes they would just outright say [the price] for a night or two, or ‘an hour’.” It was obvious what was going on, said Cruz, but “the managers would claim it was too vague, so in the end they would just leave it up”. Cruz and three other moderators we spoke to claimed that in examples like this, where their managers felt there was insufficient evidence to escalate the case, moderators could receive lower accuracy scores, which in turn would affect their performance assessments. “We would take negative hits on their accuracy scores to try to get some help to these people,” Cruz said. The limits of the law * * * While the law requires Meta to report any child exploitation imagery detected on its platforms, the company is not legally responsible for crimes that occur on its platform, because of a law created almost three decades ago, in the early days of the internet. In 1996, the US Congress passed the Communications Decency Act, which was primarily intended to ensure online pornographic content was regulated. But section 230 of the act states that providers of “interactive computer services” – which includes the owners of social media platforms and website hosts – should not be treated as the publisher of material posted by users. This section was included in the act to ensure the free flow of information while protecting the growing tech industry from being crushed by litigation. Whereas a newspaper, say, must legally defend what it publishes, section 230 means that a company like Meta, which hosts the content of others, may not be held liable for what appears on its platforms. Section 230 therefore positions internet service providers as fundamentally neutral: offering forums in which illegal, harmful or false content may be posted and circulated, but ultimately not responsible for that content. Since the passing of the act, tech companies such as Meta have argued successfully in courts across the US that section 230 provides them with complete immunity from prosecution for any illegal content published on their platforms, as long as they are unaware of that content’s existence. The debate around section 230 has become highly polarised. Those who want section 230 amended say that the legal safe harbour it has provided for internet companies means they have no incentive to root out illegal content on their sites. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal in January, President Biden spoke out in favour of the section’s reform. “I’ve long said we must fundamentally reform section 230,” he wrote, calling for “bipartisan action by Congress to hold big tech accountable.” However, tech companies, along with internet freedom groups, argue that changes to section 230 could lead to censorship and an erosion of privacy, particularly for private, encrypted content. These arguments over section 230 are being put to the test in a landmark case that has reached the US supreme court, which focuses on how far YouTube can be considered culpable for the videos it recommends to its users. A ruling is due by the end of June. The consequences * * * Kyle Robinson is one year into serving a 10-year sentence at a federal prison in Massachusetts for sex trafficking two teenagers, one only 14 years old. We spoke to him in January over the muffled line of the prison’s payphone, our conversation interrupted by prison staff monitoring the call. Referring to himself as a pimp, Robinson described how he sought out damaged girls from care homes and on social media as a way to make money. Instagram, he said, was his platform of choice. “I find the girls that have pride in themselves, but maybe don’t have the confidence, the self-esteem,” he claimed. “I make her feel special. I give her validation, social skills, her ‘hotential’, if you know what I mean.” Once he had identified his targets, Robinson claimed that he would “coach” them and advertise them on their Instagram accounts and his own. He would talk to potential buyers through direct messages, offering to send video snippets of the girls in return for “a small deposit” – about $20 – so that the buyers could see what they would be getting. If a buyer decided to meet a girl, he would pay her the rest of the money later, via CashApp, he said. Robinson would then take most of that money. To crack down on such cases of child sexual exploitation, last June Meta announced new policies including age verification software that will require users under 18 to provide proof of age through uploading an ID, recording a video selfie, or asking mutual friends on Facebook to confirm their age. When we asked Tina Frundt about these new measures, she was sceptical. The kids she works with had already found workarounds; a 14-year-old, for example, might use a video selfie made by her 18-year-old friend, and pretend that it’s her own. Tina Frundt in Washington DC. Photograph: Melissa Lyttle/The Guardian Even after children have been referred to Courtney’s House, they continue to be vulnerable to traffickers. One night in June 2021, Frundt says she got a call from Maya, telling her she had arrived home safe. Frundt was relieved: she knew that Maya had spent the evening with a 43-year-old man who had been contacting her on Instagram. Frundt says that Maya, now 15, was in a fragile state: over the previous few months, her mental health had been in sharp decline and she had told Frundt she’d been feeling suicidal. Photos and explicit videos taken by a pimp showing her having sex were being circulated and sold on Instagram. Sex buyers were contacting her relentlessly through her direct messages. “She didn’t know how to make it stop or how to say no,” Frundt recalled. That night, on the phone, Frundt told Maya that she loved her and that they would talk in the morning. “That’s the last time I ever spoke to her,” said Frundt. The older man had given Maya drugs. When Maya’s mother went to wake her daughter the next morning, she found her dead. A picture of Maya that still hangs on the wall of Courtney’s House shows a baby-faced teenage girl with brown curls and a huge smile. Two years after her death, Frundt continues to grieve for her caring “girly girl” who loved makeup, board games and dancing to her favourite Megan Thee Stallion songs. “Losing one of our youth, it changes you for ever. You can never forgive yourself,” she said. Related: Crime agencies condemn Facebook and Instagram encryption plans Before Maya died, Frundt claims she spoke to Instagram on a video call, asking them to remove the exploitative content her trafficker had circulated. Frundt says that when Maya died, the videos of her being exploited were still on the platform. In July 2021, a representative from an anti-trafficking organisation sent an email to Instagram’s head of youth policy, informing her of Maya’s death. Frundt was copied in on the email. It asked why Meta’s tools designed to detect grooming had not flagged a 43-year-old man contacting a young girl. Four days later, the company sent a brief reply. If Instagram was provided with details about the alleged trafficker’s account, it would investigate. But Frundt says that it was too late. “She had already passed,” she says. “They could have done something to help her but they didn’t. She was gone.” Names marked with an asterisk have been changed to preserve anonymity. • In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

    <head>There is a difference between biological sex and gender identity</head>
    <body>Thank you so much for your article (“At last, a consensus is emerging on protecting women-only spaces”, Comment). As a left-leaning feminist, doctor and trainee psychotherapist, I wept with joy and relief to see an article that finally seemed to voice that there is a difference between biological sex and gender identity, and sometimes this difference matters. It matters most to the most vulnerable women who are also more likely to be conditioned not to speak up, including female inmates in prison, where a huge percentage have been on the receiving end of male violence and sexual assaults. I have been so upset in response to some of the confluence between sex and gender identity in language and statistics. I feel this serves neither biological women or men, nor trans women or trans men. I desperately want protection for biological women, trans women and trans men from male violence, abuse and discrimination. We shouldn’t have to wait until women are getting their necks broken on sports pitches or more women are raped by males in female-only prisons before we as a society wake up, use our common sense and listen to science. Sexual dimorphism is a biological fact of human existence. This doesn’t inhibit anyone from identifying or expressing themselves however they like and diversity should be celebrated, but sometimes sex matters. Sex-protected rights were fought for and granted for important reasons and we can’t see them erased. Kate Newman Brighton As a trans person, I won’t pretend that Sonia Sodha’s article didn’t deeply wound me. To claim an “emerging consensus” around Gender Recognition Act reform is to construct a public and to draw a line – right-thinking people on one side, gender ideologues on the other. Only a small number of trans people bother to apply for a gender recognition certificate. The process is frustrating, dehumanising, bureaucratic, but, even if it were not, a GRC has no bearing on your day-to-day life, which toilets you use, how others perceive you. Trans women have been using women’s spaces, especially public toilets, for years, with or without GRCs, but usually without. A GRC enables death and marriage certificates to be filed correctly. That’s all. My status as a trans woman is legally protected under the Equality Act, without a GRC. The government has issued guidance in the last few months advising women’s refuges and similar charities that they may exclude trans women if they believe there are reasonable grounds to do so for others’ benefit. Given the paucity of options for trans women fleeing domestic violence, this is a bad state of affairs. Sodha suggests that GRA reform is all that stands between us and a world where trans women can use whatever bathroom they please. That world is already here, and has been for decades. Finally, I think the assertion that “someone female with a GRC who gets pregnant would not be covered by Equality Act protections against pregnancy and maternity discrimination” is bogus. Trans men have made clear that the compassionate solution is to reform the Equality Act to extend such protections, rather than removing existing ones. Ell Johnson Norwich Distorting the truth Will Hutton rightly warns of the corrosive impact that “truth denial” will have on democracy (“A culture of truth denial is wilting US democracy and Britain is fast following suit”, Comment). I hope he would agree that Labour’s “attack strategy” demonstrates that this equally applies to grotesque truth distortion. Richard de Friend London NW5 Not all gloom for churches Peter Stanford’s article regretting the demise of rural church buildings was informative, but struck a rather gloomy note (“Is the melancholy fate off derelict rural churches sealed – or can we change it?”, Focus). Much can be done by communities to retain their churches if they campaign energetically and innovatively. The Romney Marsh Historic Churches Trust is a good example of how this can be done. For more than 40 years, the trust has provided funds for the maintenance of 12 medieval churches across the large marsh area of Kent, having secured support from art, entertainment, politics and journalism. It now has significant resources that are directed towards these beautiful and historic churches in their sparsely populated villages and hamlets. What has been done on Romney Marsh can be replicated elsewhere. Shaun Leavey Sherborne, Dorset The SNP is where I want to be Andrew Rawnsley suggests that Labour must seize the opportunity offered by troubles in the SNP (“As the SNP loses its iron grip on Scotland, Labour must seize this golden opportunity”, Comment). He may be right, but Labour has treated Scotland badly in the past and folk have long memories. Second, Labour is no longer a left-of-centre party. Its stance on most issues is in tune with the Tories and nowhere near where I want to be. The SNP has offered Scottish voters policies and strategies that are progressive and based on the wellbeing of the nation. It has had to mitigate the worst that Westminster has thrown at us. Donald MacKay Crossford, Fife Eat like it’s 1950 The news that low-carb diets can be a cure for obesity and diabetes would not have seemed so surprising in the 1950s (“Obesity, diabetes… has this GP found the drug-free treatment?”, News). The classic textbook Human Nutrition and Dietetics (1959) stated: “The intake of foods rich in carbohydrate should be drastically reduced since over-indulgence in such foods is the most common cause of obesity.” This was common-sense advice at the time. But since then, we have been obsessed with reducing consumption of animal fats, replacing them with manufactured margarines, until the trans-fats that they contained were found to be too dangerous to eat. We have eaten sugar with abandon because throughout the second half of the 20th century we were assured that it was harmless. Had we stuck to the earlier views about diet, we could have avoided this epidemic of chronic ill-health. Maggie Watson London E9 Thanks for nothing, Nigel So one of the reasons Nigel Lawson retired to France was the “old-fashioned way of life” there (“Labour is still in thrall to the low tax regime championed by my friend Nigel Lawson”, Comment). I can still remember the old-fashioned way of life in this country: the river into which the water board did not dump tons of sewage, the time when the man from the gas board did visit, the city with the grand post office building. All gone, of course, thanks to Nigel’s programme of privatisation and deregulation. Ivor Morgan Lincoln</body>

    <head>Sex offences trial of Madeleine McCann suspect cancelled in Germany</head>
    <body>A German court has decided not to hear a sex offences case against the prime suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann on the grounds that the region where it is located is not the last place he lived in Germany. Christian Brückner was charged last year by German prosecutors in Brunswick with three offences of aggravated rape of women and two offences of sexual abuse of children. The offences took place in Portugal between December 2000 and July 2017. They are not linked to Madeleine’s disappearance. The regional tribunal in Brunswick, north Germany, said on Thursday it had decided it was “not competent” to hear the case against him because his “last known address” in Germany was in another state, Saxony-Anhalt. The trial had been due to start imminently. The decision by the court does not mean that Brückner will be freed from jail. He is serving a seven-year term in Oldenburg, expected to end in 2025, for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in the same area of the Algarve where Madeleine went missing. Despite the court’s decision, Brunswick prosecutor’s office said it would continue investigations related to Madeleine’s case. Prosecutors would also “carefully examine the reasons” given by the court and “probably” take the decision to appeal, the spokesperson for Brunswick’s prosecutors, Hans Christian Wolters, added. Brückner’s lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, argued that “on the basis of the court’s decision, the Brunswick justice system is also not competent in the Maddie case”. If Brückner’s trial is now moved to a new jurisdiction, such as Magdeburg, the closest court to where he had reportedly been living in a disused warehouse, or Frankfurt, where he was brought after his arrest by authorities in Italy, prosecutors there will have to start from scratch to familiarise themselves with details of the case, which the Brunswick authorities have been working on for several years. Brückner’s last registered address in Germany in 2016 had been in Brunswick, in the state of Lower Saxony, but purely for the sake of receiving mail, and he had not lived there, Fülscher told German media. He said the court in Brunsick had been wrong to assume that the registration was proof enough he had lived there. “Prior to his arrest abroad, the accused lived on his property in Neuwegersleben,” he said, referring to the disused warehouse in the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt. Wolters, who has been working on the case against Brückner, said he had been taken by surprise by the decision. “The court should have given both the state prosecutor and the defence lawyer this decision simultaneously,” he told Bild newspaper. Madeleine disappeared at the age of three in 2007 while on holiday in Portugal with her family. In June 2020, German police said it had evidence to suggest that she was dead – though it could not reveal what that was – and that it believed Brückner was responsible for her murder. But it has not brought charges against him. Wolters said in 2020: “If you knew the evidence we had, you would come to the same conclusion as I do, but I can’t give you details because we don’t want the accused to know what we have on him. These are tactical considerations.” Brückner has denied any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance.</body>

    <head>Marilyn Manson faces more sex abuse allegations</head>
    <body>In a lawsuit filed on Long Island, New York, on Monday, the singer Marilyn Manson was accused of “childhood and adult sexual abuse, sexual battery, assault and molestation”. Related: Marilyn Manson reaches deal with Esmé Bianco over sexual assault lawsuit The suit, which alleged Manson first targeted the unnamed plaintiff when she was 16 in 1995, came less than a week after the singer, whose real name is Brian Warner, reached a settlement with the actor Esmé Bianco, who sued him in April 2021, alleging rape and sexual battery. That suit came amid multiple allegations of abuse from other women, prominently including the actor Evan Rachel Wood. Manson, through his lawyer, has “vehemently denie[d] any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone”. He also sued Wood for defamation, emotional distress and other claims. He did not immediately comment on the new suit, which was filed under the New York Adult Survivors Act. Signed by the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, last May, the act gives alleged victims of sexual assault a window of time in which to sue regardless of when the crime allegedly occurred. Without the act, the claims would be barred from being brought forth by filing deadlines known as statutes of limitation. The writer E Jean Carroll sued Donald Trump under the act, over her allegation that he raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s, which the former president denies. The plaintiff in the new suit against Manson is described as “an adult female residing in Maryland”, born in 1979. The suit alleges that Manson “first targeted” the plaintiff “in 1995 when she was 16 years old, using his role, status, and power as an adult and performer in the music industry to gain access to, groom, manipulate and exploit her, resulting in sexual assault in two separate incidents. “Then, in 1999 when plaintiff was approximately 19 years old, defendant Warner perpetuated his grooming, manipulation, exploitation and sexual assault of plaintiff over the course of approximately four weeks.” The suit names Nothing Records and its distributor Interscope Music Publishing as co-defendants that were allegedly “aware of” Manson’s “practice of sexually assaulting minors, and aided and abetted such behavior”. The suit says Manson’s “pedophilic obsessions and violent behaviors were not only known by defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, but they were celebrated and promoted for their collective financial gain”. One of the plaintiff’s attorneys, Karen Barth Menzies, said the suit was “an indictment of the music industry for maintaining a culture that celebrates, protects and enables sexual predators”. Interscope and Universal Music, a parent company to the now defunct Nothing label, did not immediately comment. The suit says the plaintiff “suffered severe emotional, physical and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss … humiliation, shame, and horror that she will continue to suffer for the rest of her life”. It seeks unspecified damages, costs and “an order enjoining defendants from future unlawful business practices including but not limited to exposing minors and vulnerable adults to sexual abuse and exploitation”. Another attorney for the plaintiff, Jeff Anderson, who has also represented victims of sexual abuse within the Catholic church, said: “For too long, music industry predators have hidden in plain sight, believing they are above the law. “Today, we are demanding Warner face retribution, so he knows he will no longer escape his day in court. This is a day of reckoning.” In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit the Men’s Advice Line or Women’s Aid. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. Other international helplines may be found via www.befrienders.org.</body>

    <head>Clarity on C of E blessings for same-sex couples</head>
    <body>The Church of England does not “plan to offer to bless the civil marriages of same-sex couples” (Anglican groups revolt against same-sex blessing plan, 10 April). The proposal from the bishops, as yet incomplete, is that a blessing will be offered to people, not a relationship. Also, reaction against this plan is not by a “small but vocal” group. In the General Synod, the voting of laity was only 52% to 48% in favour; nearly half did not agree with what was being proposed. Those opposed are not “conservative” or “traditionalist”, but simply Anglicans. It is not they, but the Church of England itself, which believes that marriage is a lifelong and exclusive union of one man and one woman “according to the teaching of our Lord” (Canon B30) – and this teaching was specifically reaffirmed by Synod. This is canon law and, the church being established, is also the law of the land, assented to by parliament. What many people are struggling with is that some bishops appear to be arguing against the doctrine of the church that they themselves took public oaths to uphold.

    <head>Turkish presidential candidate quits race after release of alleged sex tape</head>
    <body>The Turkish presidential candidate Muharrem İnce withdrew from the race after the release of a purported sex tape, boosting chances of outright success for other candidates in a race that polls suggest will be close. İnce, a two-time presidential candidate who also lost to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2018, pulled his candidacy just days away from Turkey’s most consequential election in a generation saying: “I offered Turkey a third option, a third way. We couldn’t succeed with this way.” The former school headteacher and longtime member of the Republican People’s party (CHP) said an alleged sex tape circulating online was a deepfake, using footage taken from “an Israeli porn site”. Related: Erdoğan faces real chance of losing as Turkey gets ready to vote He added: “If I had such images of myself, they were taken secretly in the past. But I do not have such an image, no such sound recording. This is not my private life, it’s slander. It’s not real.” Polls indicate that the vote for the presidency will be a close one, where each candidate needs to get more than 51% in the first round to win outright, or face a runoff two weeks later. Erdoğan will now face CHP’s chairman, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, and the ultranationalist Sinan Oğan of the Victory party in a three-way race.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty İnce had a small spike in popularity in the polls in which he peaked at roughly 10% of the overall vote share and more recently dropped down to almost 2% in some polls. While İnce had long seemed unlikely to win, his dwindling vote share was still enough to ensure that the presidential race would go to a runoff, a scenario observers believe could favour Erdoğan. İnce formed his breakaway Homeland party two years ago after two failed bids to become party chairman of the CHP, plus a failed presidential run. Kılıçdaroğlu has led the CHP since 2010, and is spearheading a six-party opposition coalition hoping to defeat Erdoğan after 20 years in power. Hours after İnce quit the race, Kılıçdaroğlu invited him to join the opposition coalition by tweeting a link to a classic Turkish ballad. “Let’s put aside the old resentments,” he told his former rival. Oğan reportedly cancelled a planned rally and called a meeting of his advisers, but party officials declared he had no plans to withdraw. The polling organisation Metropoll predicted late last month that İnce voters would predominantly give their votes to Erdoğan’s AKP, the CHP, with some also going to the far-right Nationalist Movement party and the nationalist İyi (Good party) in the parliamentary race. The high-profile deployment of deepfake videos has already hit Turkey’s 45-day election cycle, after Erdoğan played an alleged deepfake that claimed to show banned Kurdish militants declaring their support for Kılıçdaroğlu at a pre-election rally last weekend. “What I have seen in these last 45 days, I have not seen in 45 years,” said İnce.</body>

    <head>Children in England’s schools need better sex education, experts tell MPs</head>
    <body>Children need more and better sex and relationship education in England’s schools, to help them navigate the issues they are likely to face as they get older, experts have told MPs. The Commons women and equalities committee heard that too few teachers in England have received training in how to deliver lessons in relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) since it became a compulsory topic in 2019. Lucy Emmerson, chief executive of the Sex Education Forum, told MPs that young people reported that important issues such as power imbalances in relationships between boys and girls were often not being tackled in RSHE lessons. Related: Sex education overhaul in England based on ‘overblown’ claims, say teachers “This isn’t something that you can just reel off some facts about. It relies on the confidence of a teacher to open up discussion to a diverse group and to manage some of those complexities,” Emmerson said. “And not to just put a video on and think that’s going to do the job. Because, unfortunately, that’s what young people are complaining about, that sometimes that’s all the lessons are.” Because RSHE was relatively new, “there haven’t been specialist teachers in the numbers that we need, there hasn’t always been space in the timetable or planning time, or the leadership support” in schools, Emmerson said. Jonathan Baggaley, chief executive of the PSHE Association – representing teachers of personal, social health and economics wellbeing topics – said that untrained teachers would struggle to deliver lessons on highly sensitive subjects such as self-harm. “There are ways to do that which could be damaging, in which you might instruct or even inspire practices of self-harm or in the context of eating disorders. Yet there are ways to do this incredibly safely and effectively. “If teachers are not trained in best practices to have these conversations safely, they are not going to be able to choose materials which meet those principles as well,” Baggaley said. Concern over the way primary and secondary schools can teach RSHE has caused the government to speed up its planned review into the guidance around the subject, with a public consultation expected later this year. Much of the controversy has centred around allegations of inappropriate teaching materials involving LBGTQ+ and transgender issues used by external providers. But Baggaley said his association, with members in more than 8,000 schools, was not aware of widespread poor practice. “If we want to tackle problematic materials the way to do it is through teachers having training,” Baggaley said. The MPs also heard from campaigners representing parent groups, who warned of the “sheer volume” of pornography that was affecting young people, with parents powerless to stop it. Tanya Carter, of the Safe Schools Alliance UK, called for a ban on smartphones among children and in schools. “Once you’ve got smartphones in schools, every child in that school is only as protected as the least protected child in that school. “It doesn’t matter what controls you’ve got on your own child’s smartphone, if another child in that school has no controls on their phone your child can be exposed to hardcore porn at lunchtime,” Carter said.</body>

    <head>From scheduling sex to being selfish: 10 ways to improve intimacy</head>
    <body>1. Talk about any problems Things seem to work well without really thinking about it. Then, when it starts going wrong, you don’t quite know how to talk about it, so the situation gets to a point where you’re stuck and you don’t know how to deal with it. The first stage in addressing this is for each person to spend a couple of days thinking about what they see the problem is, and then agreeing to sit down together for a discussion. Take turns saying: “This is what I think the problem is, and this is how it is affecting me.” Out of this comes the opportunity to really get to the heart of the matter and work out what is needed. 2. Look for the reasons why sex might have changed How did sex use to be? What was intimacy like? What has changed? What are the blocks to sorting it out? There may have been occasions when you might not have wanted to be sexual or you might not have been in the mood, and that got misinterpreted, or there were a few times when you got rejected. And then you get into a pattern of not having sex or avoiding it. 3. Talk about how you first met. And make an effort to look nice Spend an evening chatting about what you liked about the other person. You can remind each other of what drew you both together. Do that on the first night, then on the next night, dress up, go out for a meal and make an effort to feel and look special. What you’re likely to find is that you’re feeling much more connected and that can lead to noticing desire, feeling sexual, and you can reignite something that has perhaps been lost for a while. 4. Every time you leave the house (and come back) make a point of having a kiss or a cuddle There is no intention that it is going to lead to sex, you just get used to the idea you can reclaim intimacy. Make a point of saying, “I like what you’re wearing”, send texts to each other throughout the day saying “missing you” and “look forward to seeing you”. In this way you’re recreating some of the behaviours you probably did at the beginning of your relationship and you are giving the message, “I’m noticing you and I like you”, so that the sense of feeling closer to the other person, the emotional intimacy, starts creeping back in. It’s Friday night, so that means … Photograph: vadimguzhva/Getty Images/iStockphoto 5. Schedule regular time to be intimate This is making a commitment to maintaining the relationship by saying: even though sometimes we don’t feel like it, we realise the importance of this and will try to be sexual. It is about not letting gaps appear so then it starts becoming more normal to not have sex. What your scheduling says is that Friday nights are your night, you’ll put some effort into making it special and this can lead to greater intimacy. Perhaps this means having a shower together, or maybe dressing up – above all it is about making a statement that your physical relationship is important, and you are prepared to put in the groundwork, instead of saying it is just about sex. 6. Write down on pieces of paper what really works for you both Then fold them up and put all of the bits of paper in a jar. I encourage couples to sit down and work out some of the things that each person particularly likes when they are being sexual. Then, whenever you’re going to have some intimate time, pull out a piece of paper and whatever’s there, you’ve got the chance to try. It enables an element of fun and excitement to return into the relationship which can be helpful to maintain the spark. 7. If there is a high level of anxiety attached to sex, introduce mindfulness I always suggest pelvic floor exercises, because this makes you focus on your genitals, so you become much more tuned into your body. For a man, this can increase the quality of his erection and the chances of more ejaculatory control. For a woman, it is likely to help her to regain a bit more feeling within the vaginal walls and it might help towards arousal. Take time to work out what feels comfortable. Photograph: blackCAT/Getty Images 8. For older couples, slow everything right down Try having a bath together, so you feel good and in tune with each other. Pay more attention to what position feels comfortable. If there are issues of mobility and flexibility it can be useful to try out positions first. You might want to do this while you’re still dressed when it can feel easier (and warmer). 9. Take turns to be selfish Say, “I’d really like it if you could give me a back rub”, or “I just really want the opportunity to touch you”. I often suggest couples go to bed and have a period of time when you’re both naked without needing to be sexual. Just lying next to each other, feeling the other person’s skin on your skin can be a very intimate and nourishing moment. 10. Rediscover how to be intimate with each other There are many reasons why intimacy can change in a relationship. Pregnancy and birth, ageing, body shape, resentment, arguments not being resolved, anxiety, the menopause, erectile problems … It is important to understand why you’ve reached the point where things are dysfunctional, but it is always possible to make changes. I’ve worked with couples who haven’t had sex in six years and it has been a privilege to help them rediscover how to be intimate with each other. • Peter Saddington is a clinical supervisor and a relationship and sex therapist working for Relate. An orgasm is what Barry Komisaruk, professor of psychology at Rutgers University in New Jersey, refers to as “excitation of the brain, which is often elicited from the genitalia and produces an intense buildup to a peak of muscle tension then release”. What else is going on physiologically, in order to support this, is an increase in heart rate and blood pressure to deliver the oxygen and nutrients to the muscles and to the neurons in the brain that are involved. For women, there is a contraction of the uterus, and for men a tensing of “the male plumbing system”, as Komisaruk calls it, leading to ejaculation. The pupils dilate, there is sweating, increased temperature and a change of blood flow causing a flushing of the skin. During orgasm, a flood of hormones are released, including dopamine and oxytocin, the so-called love hormone, which is also released through touch. It’s the same hormone that causes contractions in labour and is given to women to induce labour. Orgasms are often found to relieve pain. “Most of the regions of the brain that we see activated during orgasm have been reported to be activated during pain,” says Komisaruk. “This seems paradoxical because, if you’re in pain, it’s hard to have an orgasm. But actually many women have said that they use orgasm to inhibit menstrual cramps.” Finally, orgasms can help promote restful sleep, thanks partly to “the muscular exertion involved in orgasm, followed by the relaxation” explains Komisaruk. Sweet dreams, then.</body>

    <head>Sex education review is ‘politically motivated’, say teaching unions</head>
    <body>Teaching unions have criticised a “politically motivated” review of the way sex education is taught in schools, after Conservative MPs voiced concern that children were being exposed to “graphic” material including “lessons on oral sex”. Rishi Sunak has asked the Department for Education to “ensure schools are not teaching inappropriate or contested content” in the subject of relationships, sex and health education (RSHE), and will bring forward the review that was already “on the cards for some time”. Sunak confirmed the review, which will apply only to state schools in England, after a Tory MP, Miriam Cates, said children were being exposed to sex education classes that were “age-inappropriate, extreme, sexualising and inaccurate”. The prime minister and the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, are understood to be concerned about the issues raised and will consider whether schools should place clearer limits on the content taught to children, depending on their age. Posing a question to Sunak during prime minister’s questions, Cates said: “Graphic lessons on oral sex, how to choke your partner safely, and 72 genders. This is what passes for relationships and sex education in British schools. “Across the country, children are being subjected to lessons that are age-inappropriate, extreme, sexualising and inaccurate, often using resources from unregulated organisations that are actively campaigning to undermine parents. “This is not a victory for equality – it is a catastrophe for childhood.” Sunak responded: “Our priority should always be the safety and wellbeing of children, and schools should also make curriculum content and materials available to parents. “As a result of all of this, we are bringing forward a review of RSHE statutory guidance and we will start our consultation as soon as possible.” Before PMQs, Cates coordinated a letter to the prime minister that was signed by MPs including Priti Patel, former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke, Jonathan Gullis and Andrea Jenkyns, urging Sunak to launch an independent inquiry into what young children have been asked in lessons concerning how they “feel” about oral and anal sex. The joint letter warned that “even primary schoolchildren are being indoctrinated with radial and unevidenced ideologies about sex and gender”. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders and a former headteacher, said: “The vast majority of schools are incredibly cautious and sensible about the teaching of RSE and we disagree with the sweeping generalisation and inflammatory rhetoric from Miriam Cates in the Commons. “Schools are doing their best to teach children and young people about things like being safe and respectful relationships in a sensitive and age-appropriate manner, but they are constantly subjected to unhelpful potshots from various individuals and groups. “We welcome the review of relationships and sex education as part of an ongoing process of ensuring that schools and teachers are well supported in delivering this topic, but our understanding is that this review has been on the cards for some time, as one would expect, given that this is a relatively new and very important part of the curriculum.” James Bowen, director of policy for the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “It is hard to be anything other than deeply concerned by this announcement. “The overwhelming majority of schools are doing nothing more than following the government’s own statutory guidance when it comes to relationships and sex education. It is worth remembering that the current curriculum was subject to extensive consultation before it was introduced. “We have seen no evidence to suggest there is a widespread problem with pupils being presented with age-inappropriate materials, and if this were the situation, we would expect it to have been picked up on a case-by-case basis. “There is a real concern that this is a politically motivated review, rather than one based on the reality of what is happening in the vast majority of schools up and down the country.”</body>

    <head>Reframing the need for single-sex spaces under the Equality Act</head>
    <body>Re the letter from Dr Matti Wenham (Glaring flaws in the idea of excluding trans people from single-sex spaces, 11 April), this issue can be reframed as “allowing single-sex spaces as set out in the Equality Act”, rather than “excluding trans people from single-sex spaces”. Under its terms, single-sex spaces are lawful if it can be shown that this is “a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”. As there are many more women in the population than trans women, and therefore many more women than trans women who need to use public toilets, this is certainly proportionate. The term biological sex does not require quote marks as used by Dr Wenham; it’s a simple and scientifically accepted term. Dr Wenham’s assertion that trans men in women’s spaces “will mean that a greater number of more masculine people will be present in women’s spaces” conflates sex and gender, which are different things. A trans man who, for example, wears a man’s suit may well present as more masculine under the “rules” by which we gender clothes, but is biologically a woman. It is also quite an assumption that the presence in women’s spaces of “a greater number of more masculine people” who are biological women might be of more concern than an open door to biologically male people, who as a class are stronger and bigger than women and therefore potentially present more danger. Dr Wenham asserts that there is “no evidence of an increase in risk to the public … when trans people are legally allowed to access the … facilities appropriate to their preferred gender”. I wonder if Dr Wenham knows whether evidence is being collected, and what evidence exists that there isn’t an increase in risk? Absence of evidence, after all, is not evidence of absence. In short, if women’s spaces are open to trans women on any basis, women lose the right to say no to any man. Jacqui Lewis London</body>

    <head>Queensland to decriminalise sex work as review recommends new advertising rules</head>
    <body>Queensland will decriminalise sex work after a long-awaited review recommended sweeping changes to the industry to combat violence, discrimination and exploitation. A landmark review into sex work by the Queensland Law Reform Commission has made 47 recommendations, including scrapping the Prostitution Licensing Authority, repealing some police powers and allowing services to be advertised on radio and TV. The QLRC also recommended that sex workers not be singled out for public soliciting or street-based sex work, and said planning rules should allow services to operate away from industrial zones. While sex work is under a licensing framework in Queensland, about 90% of sex workers are in the “unlawful sector” privately or at unlicensed businesses. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Sex workers have long rallied against the laws that prohibit them from employing a receptionist, working with others or texting other sex workers before and after a booking to make sure they’re safe. In Queensland, police can currently also pose as clients and entrap workers by pressuring them to offer blacklisted services. Related: ‘Forced to move home’: discrimination of Queensland sex workers needs to end, say advocates The attorney-general, Shannon Fentiman, said the government was “broadly supportive” of recommendations and supported decriminalising sex work. Fentiman said decriminalisation of sex work would “ensure that some of the most vulnerable people in our community have legal protections at work”. She confirmed this would mean abolishing the Prostitution Licensing Authority, which regulates the state’s 20 brothels. “The sex-work industry will be regulated by workplace health and safety laws, planning laws, advertising codes and standards, and public amenity and public nuisance laws,” she told reporters on Monday. Fentiman said the government hoped to introduce legislation before the end of the year after consulting key stakeholders. “We will need to work through each of the recommendations to work out how best to implement the intent of the law reform commission,” she said. The report found the current framework undermined the health, safety and justice of sex workers. Those interviewed said they were reluctant to report crimes to police for fear of arrest or not being believed. The QLRC said the law should respond to “reality, not myths”. “Stereotypes about most sex workers being street workers, victims of exploitation or trafficking, or ‘vectors of disease’ are not supported by the evidence or reflected in the diversity of the sex-work industry,” the report said. “The assumption that decriminalising sex work will increase the size of the industry is also unsupported.” Related: Australian court: hotel discriminated against prostitute by refusing room Sex worker and state coordinator of Respect Inc, Lulu Holiday, said decriminalisation will be a “life-changing policy shift”. “Decriminalisation would mean I wouldn’t have to worry every time a client contacts me that it might be a police officer. I’d be able to work in a way that feels safe for me without being worried that I’m at risk of arrest,” Holiday told Guardian Australia. “While it’s going to have a huge impact for us, it’s really not going to have any noticeable impact on the rest of the Queensland community.” The chief executive of the Scarlet Alliance, Mish Pony, said the announcement “brings Queensland in line with domestic and international best practice”. “Decriminalisation is a cost-effective, high compliance model for government and supports workplace health, safety and rights for sex workers,” Pony said. The Queensland government confirmed last month it will also move to scrap an exemption of the state’s Anti-Discrimination Act which allows employers to discriminate against sex workers and gender-diverse and transgender people when working with children. The exemption will be repealed, along with another clause that allows accommodation providers to lawfully discriminate against sex workers if there is a “reasonable belief” that they are engaging in sex work on the premises.</body>

    <head>Ministers consider rule to let single-sex schools bar transgender pupils</head>
    <body>The government is considering issuing guidance to single-sex schools in England saying that they cannot be legally obliged to take transgender pupils, as part of advice to be released this term. The advice, first reported by the Telegraph, is also likely to include direction for schools to inform parents about children questioning gender identity. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be particularly keen that the rules clarify in detail that parental consent is paramount in the way that schools approach pupils questioning their gender identity. The advice, which is being drawn up by the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, and Kemi Badenoch, who holds the equalities portfolio, comes after the Girls’ Day School Trust said last year it would only admit pupils based on sex, rather than gender. However, schools have sought legal advice about enforcing the rule amid concerns it could breach the Equality Act. A government source said the guidance being drafted was hoped to clarify the legal situation for schools on admitting transgender pupils and on using preferred pronouns. A draft version of the guidance is expected to be put out to consultation within weeks. The guidance is expected to say that schools would not be breaching the Equality Act 2010 if they did not accommodate transgender pupils, although no pupils would be required to leave a school if they started questioning their gender identity. This would mean that girls’ schools would be able to reject applications from pupils who identify as female but whose legal sex is male, and vice versa for boys’ schools. The changes are expected to be announced before the summer recess, Keegan told Times Radio on Monday. “We need to be sensitive obviously to children but more importantly make sure parents are fully involved as well,” she said. “We need to look after the wellbeing of all pupils. In that case, the wellbeing of girls is also very important and ‘good morning, girls’ is absolutely fine to say in a girls’ school to a girls’ class. We have to be sensible and have a big dose of common sense here. “We can’t mix up sex and gender. We’ve seen what happened in Scotland when it got that round the wrong way. And really our guidance needs to provide safeguarding for all children and make sure that, you know, it does cover all children’s rights as well.” The new advice comes amid changes that could be made to the Equality Act, backed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) but condemned by LGBTQ+ groups. Badenoch is considering changing the Equality Act to allow organisations to bar trans women from single-sex spaces and events, including hospital wards and sports. The change by the equalities secretary would redefine sex in the 2010 act to specifically refer to legal protections for “biological sex” – the sex assigned at birth. The EHRC, the equalities watchdog, said the new definition would make it possible to exclude trans people from same-sex spaces even if they hold a gender recognition certificate (GRC). Stonewall said the EHRC’s letter in support of the change offered “no substantive evidence of demand” for it, and the group did “not see a world where cis women are desperate to exclude trans women from their spaces”.</body>

    <head>Non, minister. Spare us the derriere sex scenes and stick to politics</head>
    <body>Sex in novels is frequently terrible and occasionally so excruciating as to verge on the actionable; indeed, a legal precedent that would penalise writers for scorching their readers’ retinas with the sheer heat of embarrassment might function as a useful deterrent. Literature needs all the fans it can get; protect us from the throbbing gristle and heaving mammaries of a thousand overheated imaginations. Institute a particular ban on the word moist, and freedom of speech be damned. Alas, it would be too late to curb the creative enthusiasms of Bruno Le Maire, the French economy minister whose most recent novel, Fugue Américaine, has erm, risen to prominence courtesy of a dilated anus. Protect your eyes and do not enquire further. Naturally, much of the truly gripping stuff is going on beyond the page. Le Maire stands accused of fiddling while Paris burns, amusing himself on his typewriter as France’s citizens stand on the barricades protecting their pension rights and railing against the callousness of the Macron administration. This feels harsh: everyone has a right to a life outside work and writing about an anus seems small beer compared with eating one on national television in a celebrity game show, or hosting frothing rightwing debates, were one, say, to be a sitting member of parliament. Le Maire has form in literary circles, not merely as an author – this is not his first rodeo – but as an actual character; he is the inspiration, if that is le mot juste, for the character of politician Bruno Juge in Michel Houellebecq’s most recent novel, Anéantir (Annihilate), a typically lighthearted romp through woes both contemporary and timeless: mortality, the death of love, violence, alienation, that sort of thing. Le Maire and Houellebecq are pals, whose intimate soirées to parse passages of Balzac were written in the stars when the politician helped the writer in the tricky bureaucratic matter of repatriating his beloved corgi Clément’s remains from Ireland to France over a decade ago. (So attached was Houellebecq to Clément that he exhibited a series of photographs and watercolours of him at Paris’s Palais de Tokyo a few years ago, accompanied by the deceased dog’s toys and a monologue by Iggy Pop. And they say the English are mad about their dogs.) But back to sex. It rarely thrives out of context, whether in prose or actual life, and we should salute Le Maire for having a go; he is, at least, interested in books, rather than being a mere dilettante cashing in on his public profile. Politicians, as we know, have far less edifying passions, and the gatekeepers who would create a special category of “proper” writers should remember that for every Dorries there is a Disraeli. We must not be cowed by the memory of Boris Johnson’s sub-Wodehousian foray into fiction, Seventy-Two Virgins, though it is to be devoutly hoped he never attempts it again. Meanwhile, in life as in literature, there is always a subtext. Le Maire, who has previously clashed with Macron, is touted as a possible contender in the French presidential elections of 2027, in which the incumbent cannot stand for a third term. It’s a little early for his rivals to get going, but if the electorate remembers a dilated anus before it remembers Le Maire’s political record, then tant pis. • Alex Clark writes for the Guardian and the Observer Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    <head>Cursed Bread by Sophie Mackintosh – sex, death and baking</head>
    <body>Three books in, we can begin to say that there are traits in Sophie Mackintosh’s novels which are particularly Mackintoshian. The image of a woman with a man’s hand around her throat. The attendant sexual violence that image suggests. A veil thrown over questions of time and location that lends both prose and plot a gauzy, fever-dream quality. That gauzy quality is likewise aided by a set of strict rules established for each story world, and momentum in Mackintosh’s novels is usually the result of those structures dissolving. What happens when three girls raised on an island away from men are finally confronted with them, as in The Water Cure, or the progress of a woman who has chosen to have a child in a country where she has been forbidden from doing so by a fertility lottery (Blue Ticket). Cursed Bread is a quietly rich maturation of Mackintosh’s skill, set in a semi-rural postwar French town. It is narrated by Elodie, a woman of indeterminate age. She is married to a passionless baker, provider of the titular bread – a man who touches her around four times a year and is usually too drunk to stay hard if they have sex. When she watches his still-strong hands kneading dough each day, one can see why Elodie might be dissatisfied with life. “Perhaps I’ll throw myself off a bridge or bake myself into a pie, what do you think?” she asks her husband brightly one afternoon. He shrugs. They attend a midsummer festival instead. To some extent, it is the small churn of bucolic domesticity that endows this novel with the uncanny quality also present in Mackintosh’s other books – this is a world in which women wash clothes at the lavoir, make confession on Sundays, faithfully aid their husbands’ work as butchers or grocers. “Sometimes,” Elodie recounts, “not very often, I found myself tied around the throat with a hot thread of panic at the inevitability of the days.” Enter diamond-adorned Violet and her husband, “the ambassador”. They have moved into the town’s only mansion at the behest of the government to carry out a survey of its citizens. Somewhat predictably, the arrival of two glamorous wealthy strangers begins to upset things. At the lavoir, women pore over Violet’s silk blouses and ribboned knickers. They speculate about the expense of her groceries until rumour inevitably replaces fact – Violet is a “whore”; Violet was once “mad”. If you take into account the backdrop of recently shelled buildings, you can reason a link between this kind of bitchiness in the face of material wealth and the deprivation the town has endured. This is a book about the power desire and greed exert over reality and memory: its characters recoil, necessarily, from the harsh considerations of sociopolitical infrastructure that manufacture their circumstance. Violet and Elodie become friends. Part of the novel is epistolary: we learn, in dribs and drabs, that Elodie now resides by the seaside, that most of the town, including her husband, have perished, and that she and Violet no longer speak. Parsing this information for clues has limited value – if the title Cursed Bread isn’t enough of an indicator, then lines such as “eat the bread and you’ll die” provide the backstory. It is more fun, instead, to consider the complex web of desires between the two couples: Elodie wants to sleep with Violet because Violet might want to sleep with the baker, which also means the ambassador flirts with Elodie, and this only increases Elodie’s desire to sleep with the baker. If this sounds deliciously horny, that’s because it is. There’s also a nastiness with which the characters inveigle their way into each other’s lives: Elodie steals Violet’s makeup and clothes; Violet takes pleasure in lying to Elodie. This violence soon spills over to the town at large in the form of a field of dead horses, ghosts, a boy who throws himself into a bonfire. In Mackintosh’s previous novels, I have sometimes wondered to what end such violence truly works. At their heart, her books are concerned with the politics of gender, the suffering those structures induce. But their male characters are too thinly and unforgivingly painted; there is no easy point of access for men to understand the women tortured, while for female readers the imaginative framework of The Water Cure and Blue Ticket seldom extends beyond blunt force trauma. Few of us need reminding of all the ways it is terrible to be a woman in the world. Cursed Bread presents a subtler rendering of how enough desperation behind the words “I want” can make one ill, and is all the more gripping for it. “What would ever be enough?” Elodie despairs midway through. “Perhaps my desire is always going to turn on me, snap at my hand even when I’ve fed it, twist it into new and unruly shapes.” In attending to these shapes, Mackintosh has entered a brilliant new stage of writing. Cursed Bread by Sophie Mackintosh is published by Hamish Hamilton (£14.99). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.</body>

    <head>Firearms officer ‘secretly filmed sex and shared video with colleagues’</head>
    <body>A firearms officer who allegedly secretly filmed himself having sex with two women before sharing the footage online with his colleagues is under criminal investigation, it has been reported. The West Midlands police officer was said to have filmed the encounters at a Christmas party without the women’s knowledge before sending the videos to members of his team via social media, Channel 4 News said. The programme said 10 West Midlands police officers and staff members also allegedly shared offensive and derogatory material on social media. An internal inquiry centring on the firearms unit is under way and some of those under investigation have been removed from frontline firearms duties. The former victims commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, called for the officers to be suspended immediately while investigations continue, and insisted it was “no longer at all appropriate” that police are able to carry out their own vetting. “These attitudes don’t develop in a vacuum where they would be actively discouraged,” she said. “I think we’ve seen … whole cultural problems about sexuality in particular, and this has a bit of an inevitability about that, really. “I think there are very serious problems about vetting. There have been so many errors made by so many forces that have culminated in men who should never have been in the force in the first place being looked at in exactly this way. “It seems to me it is no longer at all appropriate that the police should carry out their own vetting. It should be done, in my view, with the intervention of some outside people.” Jess Phillips, the Birmingham Yardley MP who is shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, echoed these views, telling the programme: “What is the standard for vetting, disciplinary, suspension in these instances? “For too long in West Midlands police, as well as in pretty much every police force across the country, we have seen cases where officers accused either through the criminal process or the employment processes of the police have been put on light duties, for example. It’s just not appropriate.” West Midlands police told the programme there was no place in policing for misogynistic, discriminatory behaviour and that they are working hard to ensure predatory individuals are not only rooted out of the force but that vetting is strengthened to ensure that they cannot join the force in the first place.</body>

    <head>CBI brand is broken ‘beyond repair’ by sex attack and misconduct claims</head>
    <body>The future of the Confederation of British Industry is in the balance this weekend as one business leader warned its brand was “beyond repair”. A CBI board statement on Friday said there was demand for “far reaching change” after allegations of sexual attacks and harassment first revealed by the Guardian. The organisation has suspended key activities until June after an exodus of business members. It is now embroiled in a City of London police inquiry into an alleged rape at a CBI staff party and an inquiry by the law firm Fox Williams into allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct. Andy Wood, chief executive of the Suffolk brewer Adnams, said the organisation which was founded by royal charter in 1965 had “probably run its course”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday: “I think probably the CBI brand is now beyond repair. It will have to reinvent itself root and branch. “This is deep-rooted cultural and behavioural issues and I think we’re going to have to move on to a new place. We have some terrific trade associations and they can represent our organisation for the time being.” Adnams is among more than 60 firms and organisations that have cancelled or suspended CBI membership over the furore. They include BP, Shell, Rolls-Royce, Barclays, John Lewis and National Grid. The CBI said in its 2021 annual report that its total income for the year was £25m, with £22.2m from subscriptions. It does not disclose its membership list, but claims to represent 190,000 members through trade associations and a much smaller number of direct members, reported to be around 1,500. The Guardian revealed claims this month that more than a dozen women claimed to have been victims of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI. One of the complainants alleged she had been raped at a CBI summer boat party on the Thames in 2019. A second woman has also alleged she was raped by two male colleagues while working at the CBI, according to a Guardian report on Friday. Allegations concerning complaints about the conduct of Tony Danker, then the director general, were reported by the newspaper last month. One female employee was said to have claimed that Danker made unwanted verbal contact with her which she considered to be sexual harassment. He was dismissed on 11 April. Danker insists he never used sexual language at work. Danker, who was appointed in November 2020, has complained that he has been made a “fall guy” and his reputation has been destroyed by wrongly being associated with allegations of serious sexual offences. He told the BBC that four reasons were cited for his dismissal, including viewing the Instagram accounts of CBI staff and sending non-work-related messages to employees on work messaging platforms. Paul Drechsler, a leading business figure and CBI president from 2015 to 2018, said it was “incredibly sad” for the victims of the reported assaults. He said he also had great sympathy with hard-working staff at the CBI who had “devoted their careers” to make the UK a successful business nation. He said he had no indication of any allegation of sexual misconduct at the organisation or any failings in its oversight while working as president, an unpaid role. “It came out of the blue,” he said. “I’m devastated.” He added: “I’ve been around business for 40 years, all sorts of organisations around the world. I spent a lot of time at this organisation and I didn’t see anything even remotely close to this kind of stuff.” Drechsler said the CBI fulfilled an important function, but it needed to understand what had gone wrong and fix the issues. He said: “In today’s world, patience is very short. They clearly don’t have long to find a way forward.” Baroness Wheatcroft, former editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal Europe, told Times Radio the future for the CBI appeared bleak. “It’s very hard to see that it has a positive future, I’m afraid. This organisation has presided over the most extraordinary culture by the sound of it,” she said. “It’s very hard to imagine an organisation where not one but two allegations of rape are now being investigated, and I think it makes it nigh-on impossible for the CBI to do the job that it’s there to do.” She added: “I think it’s time for a total rethink. The CBI is having to accept itself that it was clearly deeply flawed and now it’s looking for a new sense of direction... they probably need to disband.” In a statement on Friday, the CBI said it was taking steps to “address our failings”. The statement said: “Much needs to change if we are to win back trust so we may continue to represent business at this critical time for the country.”</body>

    <head>Giant clitorises, sex parties and porn addiction: Cara Delevingne’s eye-opening journey to Planet Sex</head>
    <body>For a period in the early 2010s, it was impossible to turn a newspaper page or open any form of social media without seeing the voluptuous eyebrows of Cara Delevingne and, beneath them, her tongue sticking out of her mouth, giving off a manic puppy energy. She’d make gang signs despite growing up in well-heeled Belgravia, and wear beanies at slouchy, Smurf-like angles. Delevingne became a sort of lovable if OTT caricature, one her friend Kate Moss captured perfectly when she dressed as her for Halloween. This ubiquity wasn’t entirely Delevingne’s fault. What 20-year-old thrust into fame and (even more) fortune would not take advantage of the endless work opportunities, invites and access that came her way? And even more so: we have a media that will see any new thing, especially if that thing is young and female, and hound it, in some cases, to death. These days, Delevingne is a rare presence on catwalks, but has branched out with acting (Suicide Squad, Paper Towns) and singing (backing vocals for Fiona Apple). She’s designed capsule collections for Mulberry and DKNY, launched her own brand of prosecco and invested in a sex-toy company. It is that, combined with the fact she was once photographed carrying a giant BDSM sex bench into her home, which means that her fronting a documentary called Planet Sex is not as outre as it might appear. Planet Sex arrives on Thursday on BBC iPlayer. The first episode, centred on female pleasure, has garnered the most attention, probably for the detail that Delevingne “donates” an orgasm to a research lab in Germany, which rather conjures up an image of her struggling along a strasse with a giant climax in a bin bag. As it is, she has a wank in a sterile room then has her bloods taken, whereupon a husband and wife scientist team tell her the results show high levels of endocannabinoids. In layperson’s terms, this means that coming makes you feel good. Hardly a revelation. (Or it may be, to the 35% of straight women Delevingne tells us do not experience orgasm during intercourse.) In New York, Delevingne visits artist Sophia Wallace, who makes giant, anatomically-correct models of clitorises. They look a Jeff Koons, if Jeff Koons made wishbones, but in a good way. There’s a low-lit sex party at which multiple women lick the salt for their tequila shots from Delevingne’s thighs, which is not something you get with Adam Curtis (though there is a similar amount of rocket-launching archive footage). Delevingne is curious and enthusiastic throughout, imbuing the script with a sense of fun, and charming the experts and case studies. She’s an entertaining fourth-wall breaker, and evidently keen to learn and explore. There’s a fascinating episode (the third) on porn addiction and what it does to people’s brains, which includes input from the ever-articulate Make Love Not Porn founder and educator Cindy Gallop. But it is episode two which stands out as a genuinely affecting and brutally honest piece of television. During Delevingne’s rise to fame, she was in a two-year relationship with the musician Annie Clark (professionally known as St Vincent). It seemed a slightly odd pairing; the cerebral, New Yorker-profiled Clark with the goofy young model, but it was uplifting in its prominence. More often than not, female same-sex relationships exist in the fashion and music worlds as titillating PR stunts or fetishism-as-accessory; yet here was a for-real couple on the front rows of Paris and London. It was a big deal. But if one had the impression that Delevingne found this openness easy, Planet Sex makes it clear it was – and continues to be – no such thing. As well as potentially jeopardising her career (still! In 2022!), coming out in the public eye, Delevingne tells us, meant that she did not get a chance to “develop her queerness”; she has never been to a Pride event. To correct this, she visits the notorious lesbian bacchanal that is the Dinah Shore weekend in Palm Springs, California, splashes with lots of half-naked women in swimming pools, and has a blast (“I have gay friends now!”). She speaks, too, about internalised homophobia, which is increasingly taboo in a world where people can’t just be OK with their bodies, but have to be “body positive”; can’t merely admit that they have mental health issues, but have to extol the virtues of ostensible benefits. Delevingne does not second-guess anything she says, and it is incredibly refreshing. On more than one occasion, she worries that she’s “not human” and mentions past suicidal ideation. On another, you see her, in real-time closeup, come to the conclusion that a particular habit she’s developed is unhealthy. Those eyebrows furrow. It’s basically a 45-minute exposition of shame, and I’m not even sure Delevingne realises how brave or bold she’s being. (She is also very funny. On the high retirement population of Palm Springs: “What do I know about Palm Springs? It’s hot, it’s a desert. And it’s where old people go to die.”) While Delevingne plus sex was never going to be a hard sell, presenting is an area that comes naturally to her. She’s self-aware enough to tease herself about “going on a journey”. And yet, she has said that making this series changed her life. So often, this is the kind of baloney celebrities come out with when they’ve popped to a famine-struck country for a weekend, or in this case, hung out with a Buddhist monk drag-queen. But throughout Planet Sex, there are moments that are disarming in their emotional candour and intelligence – and others where revelation almost audibly clicks. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at befrienders.org.</body>

    <head>Police recruits with links to domestic abuse and sex offenders ‘still being appointed’</head>
    <body>Police officers with links to organised crime, sex offenders and domestic abuse have made it through vetting procedures in recent months despite an overhaul of the process following the murder of Sarah Everard, according to the police watchdog for England and Wales. In a letter to the home secretary, Suella Braverman, HM inspector of constabulary, Matt Parr, said an examination of vetting files over two months found concerns about multiple new recruits. They included: An officer with a history of domestic abuse against multiple partners. An officer with a connection to a criminal gang. An officer who had a family member who was a registered sex offender. An officer who had a family member who had been jailed for drug dealing. His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) examined 300 vetting files between 1 December 2022 and 31 January 2023 and found 13 were of concern. The letter, published today, states: “In all 13 cases, we disagreed with the vetting decisions. We weren’t satisfied that the forces involved had adequately considered the risks associated with appointing the applicants. We were left with substantial questions about the wisdom of appointing them.” In at least three cases forces have withdrawn or suspended vetting clearance after concerns were raised by the HMICFRS, it added. The findings come after an initial report on vetting, published in November, found that poor vetting procedures and failures of leadership had allowed potentially thousands of “predatory” officers to join the police. The report was ordered after the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021 by a serving Metropolitan police officer, Wayne Couzens. Responding to the progress report, Braverman said she had launched the second phase of the Angiolini inquiry into Everard’s rape and murder, which is being chaired by Dame Elish Angiolini, formerly Scotland’s top prosecutor. Braverman said vetting had to be “beyond reproach in every single police force across the country”. The HMICFRS update said there had been “some improvements since our inspection, but not all forces can demonstrate acceptable progress on some recommendations”. It added that the report made nine vetting-related recommendations to each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales and estimated that 73% had or were likely to be addressed by the deadlines set. Braverman said: “Good progress is being made, but there can be no excuses and I expect all forces to redouble their efforts to implement all of the Inspectorate’s recommendations by the deadlines set. “The government is driving forward work to improve culture, standards and behaviour across policing – including reviewing the process to dismiss officers who fall far short – and I will continue to hold forces to account to restore public trust in the profession.” The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said “swift and robust action” had been taken since the initial report, adding: “It is only right that police forces are held to account and we thank HMICFRS for its ongoing scrutiny. We will now examine the review’s findings in detail and address the issues raised.” The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “For people with histories of domestic abuse, sexual offences and links to criminal organisations to still be serving officers is appalling and it is shameful that this Conservative government is still failing to introduce or enforce the highest standards across policing.”</body>

    <head>Sex education overhaul in England based on ‘overblown’ claims, say teachers</head>
    <body>Plans to overhaul official guidance on sex education in schools are blowing a perceived problem out of all proportion, teachers’ representatives have said. The Department for Education (DfE) has set out proposals to introduce age ratings designed to prevent teachers covering some subject matter with younger children, as well as other measures, after the prime minister ordered the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, to bring forward a planned review. Related: How we educate children about sex is vital. Don’t let it be part of Britain’s toxic culture war | Gaby Hinsliff Rishi Sunak did so in response to pressure from the Tory MP Miriam Cates, who claimed in the Commons earlier this month that children were being given “graphic lessons on oral sex, how to choke your partner safely and 72 genders”. On Friday, Keegan declared herself “deeply concerned about reports of inappropriate lessons being taught in schools” and the DfE confirmed Cates’s statement in the Commons on 8 March was the grounds for its new proposals on relationships, sex, health and education (RSHE) guidance. But the chief of the teaching union the Association of School and College Leaders said the claims were “overblown, sweeping and supported by evidence which is flimsy at best”. Geoff Barton, the union’s general secretary, said it was “very disappointing” to see Keegan offering “implicit criticism of schools when she says the review will restore the confidence of parents”. He said the “vast majority” of schools already teach RSHE “cautiously, sensitively and in an age-appropriate manner”. The DfE said it would lead the review, but that it would be informed by an independent panel providing “external expertise”. The guidance is expected to be released in the coming months, possibly before the beginning of the next academic year, and will then be subject to public consultation. That process is expected to conclude by the end of the year, with the guidance coming into statutory force as soon as possible after that, the department said. Announcing more details on the RSHE review, the government said it was determined to make sure such teaching “leaves children equipped to make informed decisions about their health, wellbeing and relationships, in a sensitive way that reflects their stage of development”. But Barton accused the government of providing little training and funding, while expecting teachers who specialise in other areas to cover the subject. Earlier this month, the New Social Covenant Unit, a thinktank founded by Cates, produced a report: What is Being Taught in Relationships and Sex Education in Our Schools? A Call for a Government Review. It contained no evidence the material she referred to in the Commons was prevalent in British classrooms. In a report in the Daily Telegraph published shortly before she addressed MPs, Cates cited several secondhand accounts she said had been sent to her by anonymous parents. Neither she nor the DfE has responded to requests to provide clear evidence of specific examples of the material they claimed was posing a major problem. Last week, it emerged that teachers at a school on the Isle of Man received death threats after false reports that children had been left “traumatised” by graphic sex education taught by a drag queen. An investigation by the island’s government concluded the claims were inaccurate. The guest speaker – a drag artist who was not appearing in drag – was not teaching a sex education lesson at all, but had been asked to talk to the children about “gender-neutral language and the concept of gender in the LGBTQ+ environment”. It added that the speaker’s reference to the possibility there could be as many as 72 gender identities came in response to a question from a child.</body>

    <head>Oklahoma plans new sex offender laws after rapist killed six people before trial</head>
    <body>An Oklahoma state lawmaker is planning to introduce new legislation aimed at halting the early release of certain sex offenders after a convicted rapist killed six people – including five children – at his home the night before he faced another criminal trial. The proposal from state representative Scott Fetgatter would come after the killings in his district by 39-year-old Jesse McFadden, who authorities say murdered his wife, her three children and two of their friends before he died by suicide and their bodies were discovered on Monday. Related: Seven bodies, including those of two missing teens, found in Oklahoma McFadden had served 17 years in prison for a 2003 rape conviction. McFadden was initially sentenced to 20 years but was released in October 2020 after complying with state laws that allow for prisoners to be released early. Fetgatter told NBC News he is now exploring a measure that, if ratified, would prevent inmates convicted of rape and child sexual abuse from being released early. “At the end of the day, those five children that were murdered in my district should be alive today,” Fetgatter said to the network. “That’s my priority: how do I keep this from ever happening again?” The circumstances of McFadden’s early release have raised questions for Fetgatter and others after the murder-suicide McFadden allegedly carried out in Henryetta – about 90 miles from Oklahoma City – made national headlines. A month after McFadden’s release, he was arrested again for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit text messages and photos with a child through a cellphone that he smuggled into prison in 2016. He was released on a $25,000 bond. McFadden was scheduled to appear in court on 1 May for the start of a trial as he faced charges for possessing child sexual abuse imagery and soliciting sexual conduct with a minor. But on 3 May, local law enforcement officials confirmed that seven bodies they had found two days earlier – all with gunshot wounds to the head – belonged to McFadden, his wife, her three children and two of the children’s friends. Authorities identified McFadden’s victims as 35-year-old Holly Guess, who married him in May 2022; and her three children: Rylee Allen, 17; Michael Mayo, 15; and Tiffany Guess, 13. Two other girls who were found dead at the family’s home had gone there for a sleepover: 15-year-old Brittany Brewer and Ivy Webster, 14. They had been reported missing the night before and were also found by authorities. The state said it is still investigating a motive. Loved ones of the victims have since expressed outrage that McFadden was released from prison early even though he ultimately faced charges for alleged criminal misconduct while imprisoned. Justin Webster, the father of Ivy Webster, told the Associated Press that he is determined to “tell Ivy’s story and our story and get our government officials and everybody to start speaking up loud and keeping those pedophiles in jail”. “There needs to be repercussions and somebody needs to be held accountable,” he said. Janette Mayo, mother of Holly Guess and grandmother of her three children, told the Associated Press that “Oklahoma failed to protect families”. “Because of that my children – my daughter and my grandchildren – are all gone,” she said. “I’ve lost my daughter and my grandchildren and I’m never going to get to see ‘em, never going to get to hold them and it’s killing me.” The state’s department of correction told the local television news station KFOR in a statement that McFadden, “for most of his incarceration”, was classified as a prisoner who was eligible for early release once had completed 85% of his sentence. He lost the classification for several months after the child sexual abuse imagery and smuggled cellphone allegations but ultimately regained it, the department said. “He was assigned to level 1 in January 2017 following his misconduct occurring in December 2016 for possessing a contraband cellphone. He returned to level 4 through the proper steps in June 2017 through the end of his incarceration,” the department said. Upon his release, McFadden was required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life and check in every 90 days with the local sheriff’s office. He complied with those requirements. Registered sex offenders are allowed to live with their own children and stepchildren as long as the children are not victims of the offender, according to Oklahoma law.</body>

    <head>I have panic attacks during sex – and it is torturing my husband</head>
    <body>My husband and I are in our 30s and have been together for nine years, with no children. I had severe anxiety and depression a couple of years ago, which I continue to struggle with. As a result I’ve always struggled with sex. I’ve never felt that sexual and although I love my husband very much – he’s a very kind, caring and patient man – I know sex is important to him. I enjoy intimacy such as kissing and cuddling, but we haven’t had sex for more than seven months and the last time we tried I had a panic attack. We’ve been communicating with each other about how to get through this and what could be the issue, but have no idea how to proceed. At the ages of 33 and 34 we are facing the prospect (I believe) of a sexless marriage. I know deep down this is torture for him and I would rather let him go than have him face the rest of his life in a sexless relationship. Anxiety and depression can significantly lower one’s sexual desire, and some of the medications used to treat them can negatively affect various aspects of one’s sexual response. It is vital that you speak about your sexual challenges to whoever is treating your mood disorder. Do not underestimate the seriousness of having a panic attack during attempted sex. You deserve to have the treatments that will help you become psychologically and sexually healthy, so advocate strongly for your own healing. Many people find it difficult to discuss sex with their doctors and think they have no right to enquire about the possibility of sexual side effects from their prescribed medications. Don’t be one of them. Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.

    <head>Chef wrongly branded sex offender wins long fight to stay in UK</head>
    <body>A chef from Bangladesh who was wrongly recorded as a sex offender by the Home Office has won the right to remain in the UK after fighting since 2010. Saiful Islam, 47, arrived in the UK in 2003 at the age of 27 after being granted a work permit to take up a job as a chef in a Thai restaurant. In 2005 he raised the alarm with the police and the Home Office that his employer was exploiting him by withholding most of his wages, forcing him to work 18-hour days, and beating him. The Home Office allowed him to move to a different employer but when he applied for indefinite leave to remain in 2010, when his work permit was about to expire, he was instead served with a notice curtailing his visa. It later emerged that the Home Office had wrongly recorded that he had entered the UK illegally and that he was a convicted sex offender, despite him having no criminal convictions. Now, after a case that has spanned seven prime ministers, from Tony Blair to Rishi Sunak, involved multiple court cases and a huge volume of correspondence with the Home Office, Islam has been granted leave to remain in the UK. Islam welcomed the decision, but said he would fight on for better compensation than the £5,000 offered by the Home Office. “I can never get back the time I’ve lost nor the impact on my health. I was a young man when I came to the UK but I have aged so much. I am an honest man. I am saving money so that one day I will be able to open my own restaurant,” he said. Fizza Qureshi, chief executive of Migrants’ Rights Network, who has supported Islam, welcomed the Home Office decision. “We hope Saiful can now rebuild his life,” she said. “What we fail to understand is why this was not decided sooner. The Home Office has left him in turmoil and uncertainty for so many years.” During his campaign for justice, Islam wrote thousands of letters and emails to parliamentarians, journalists, Home Office officials and others he believed could help. His right to remain in the UK had been rejected by a court in 2019, despite a judge identifying multiple errors by the Home Office, including wrongly curtailing his visa, linking other people’s criminal convictions to him, and failing to disclose a full copy of his passport to the court in 2010. Judge Jackson in the upper tribunal of the immigration chamber said that problems with a work permit application made by another employer on Islam’s behalf in 2008 meant he did not qualify for leave to remain in the UK. In 2019 Home Office officials issued a full apology to Islam, stating in an email to him that he had been wrongly recorded as a sex offender. The email admits that police national computer checks on Islam’s file pertained to three other people. It states: “After investigating the issue it appears documents relating to three individuals were incorrectly placed on your paper file. A number of processes had not been followed which allowed these errors to occur.” The document adds: “Although such errors are not common … we recognise that such issues can have significant impacts.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not routinely comment on individual cases.”</body>

    <head>Indian government labels same sex-marriage ‘elitist’ as supreme court hearing begins</head>
    <body>The Indian government has expressed its vehement opposition to the legalisation of same-sex marriage, calling it an “urban elitist concept” that undermines religious and social values, as the supreme court begins hearings on the rights of LGBTQ people to be married under the law. On Tuesday, dozens of petitions from LGBTQ couples and activists were brought before the country’s highest court as part of a collective lawsuit that is battling for the right of LGBTQ people to be married and have equality under the law. It is the most significant challenge to the gay rights status-quo since 2018 when, in a landmark judgment, the supreme court struck down a colonial era law criminalising homosexuality. The hearings on same-sex marriage come amid a gradual societal shift in India where LGBTQ people are becoming more visible, particularly in popular culture and in pride marches held in major cities, while there is a growing awareness around the right to equality. However, most accept there is still a long way to go in terms of full social acceptance and safety from stigma and harassment, as the country remains deeply traditional and patriarchal. Related: Campaigners celebrate as India decriminalises homosexuality The chief justice has called the marriage issue one of “seminal importance” and a five-judge panel will hear the case, which is expected to go for at least two weeks. On Monday the Hindu nationalist government, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, submitted a strongly worded affidavit to the supreme court expressing its opposition to same-sex marriage and seeking to get the case thrown out of the court. “A valid marriage is only between a biological male and a biological woman,” said the government’s submission, stating that any equality offered to same-sex couples went against religious values and “seriously affects the interests of every citizen”, arguing that such a decision should be made by parliament not the courts. The Modi government also recently opposed the promotion of a gay lawyer to the supreme court on the basis of his sexuality. The lawyers and petitioners who brought the lawsuit were optimistic about the case, emphasising that the supreme court had made several significant rulings on LGBTQ rights even in the face of government opposition, including a 2014 case which recognised transgender people as a “third gender”. Among those fighting the case are Kavita Arora and Ankita Khanna, a couple from Delhi who have been together for 11 years, after working together and eventually falling in love. Their motivation for bringing the case was both practical – the need for a joint bank account, to give each other medical consent and to be legally recognised for inheritance – but also, said Khanna, a “fundamental belief that India as a democracy is a place for diversity, equality and justice for all and under the constitution our rights are no less than others.” Arora added: “As we have grown together, we’ve understood that marriage in our country, in our culture, means a lot of important things: It means a sense of social recognition, a sense of validation and legally it sanctions a whole lot of different rights that queer couples are denied.” They couple had first attempted to get married in a civil union September 2020 but were turned away and decided to take their case to the courts. “We do have faith in the fairness of the judiciary so we thought, why just complain about it? It deserves a debate in the highest court,” said Arora. Arora and Khanna, who both work in child mental health, said that in a country like India where marriage holds huge social capital, and is almost the bedrock of society, opening up the institution to same-sex couples would be a momentous step forward in acceptance. “We realised that this isn’t just about us,” said Khanna. “This is about so many of the young people we meet and the kind of future that they should have without thinking that just because they’re queer, they can’t have an identity and a life.” A pride parade in New Delhi in 2018. Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images If India legalises same-sex marriage, it will only be the second country in Asia after Taiwan to do so. Menaka Guruswamy, one of the lawyers fighting the case who was also at the forefront of the decriminalisation of homosexuality case in 2018, said she had “complete faith in the court”. Among the issues being raised in the case is not just marriage but also the rights of same-sex couples to adopt children and for their families to have the same rights as heterosexual parents. This matter has also been opposed by the government body, the national commission for protection of child rights, which in a submission to the supreme court said “allowing adoption to same sex couple is akin the endangering the children.” The case is also pushing for the rights of trans people to have their relationships and families of their choice legally recognised, arguing that it goes against a previous judgment by the supreme court. Zainab Patel, a trans woman who is among the petitioners, said she expected it to be a long fight but said the denial of marriage to LGBTQ people “makes a mockery of our constitution and makes us second class citizens”. Rohin Bhatt, another lawyer fighting the case who identifies as queer, said the case had implications not just for LGBTQ couples but also about equality for all under the constitution, and the right to marry who you chose, regardless of gender, religion or caste; significant at a time when inter-faith and inter-caste marriages are under attack from the Hindu right wing. Bhatt described is as “dehumanising and disenfranchising” to hear the government’s arguments opposing same-sex marriage, accusing them of “emboldening homophobia”. He described it as part of a wider project of Modi’s government, as it shifted the country away from the democratic values of the constitution and towards the rule by religion. “It’s about fundamental rights of citizens,” said Bhatt. “What we are asking for as queer people in this country is merely that the rights which exist for heterosexual couples be extended to us; nothing more and nothing less.”</body>

    <head>Hunting trips, sex and a BMW: former biathlon chief charged with corruption</head>
    <body>The former head of biathlon’s governing body has been charged with “gross corruption” following allegations he accepted bribes, prostitutes and free hunting trips from Russia. Anders Besseberg, who was president of the International Biathlon Union for nearly 26 years, is also accused of receiving several expensive watches between 2009 and 2018 along with a leased BMW X5 car. If convicted Besseberg could face 10 years in prison. The charges follow a three-year investigation by Økokrim, Norway’s economic and environmental crime prosecutors. In an indictment published on Tuesday it accuses Besseberg of receiving “bribes in the form of watches, hunting stays and hunting trophies, prostitutes and a leasing car that he managed from 2011 to 2018 in Norway”. “Økokrim believes there is evidence that the defendant has received bribes continuously over a 10-year period,” Marianne Djupesland, prosecutor and first state attorney, said. “The seriousness is emphasised by the breach of trust this entails in light of his office as president of the IBU.” The charge also follows a separate independent IBU investigation in 2021, which alleged that Besseberg had received gifts of between $200,000 and $300,000 from Russian officials after the country was accused of state-sponsored doping. The IBU report, citing evidence from the police investigation, said that Besseberg admitted that he “received the service of a prostitute” while staying in Moscow, but denied specific knowledge of who had sent the woman, saying only that it was “someone, probably from the Organizing Committee”. Besseberg has been accused of receiving bribes ‘continuously over a 10-year period’. Photograph: Lee Jin-man/AP “It was notorious within IBU circles that Mr. Besseberg’s hosts would often provide him with the services of a young, female ‘interpreter’ when he visited Russia,” the report claimed. The damning 220-page report added: “There is a clear record of Anders Besseberg favouring Russian interests to such a significant extent that it justifies an inference that he did so in exchange for illicit reward, and/or because he was compromised.” The 77-year-old, who stepped down from the IBU in 2018, denies any criminal behaviour and maintains that he has never accepted a bribe, or sought to influence the IBU’s anti-doping work to the benefit of Russia. “He does not want to comment on the various charges in detail, but will explain himself to the court when the case comes up there,” Christian B. Hjort, his lawyer, said.</body>

    <head>Gillian Keegan urged to not let culture wars weaken sex education</head>
    <body>Dozens of organisations and charities have written to the education secretary, amid fears that sex education in England may become a casualty of the culture wars. More than 50 organisations concerned with education and tackling violence against women and girls (VAWG) have written to Gillian Keegan to urge her to resist the “politicisation” of sex education, following a row in which Conservative backbench MPs claimed that children were being taught “graphic lessons on oral sex, how to choke your partner safely, and 72 genders”. Rishi Sunak responded by asking the Department for Education to “ensure schools are not teaching inappropriate or contested content” in the subject of relationships, sex and health education (RSHE), and said he would bring forward a review into the subject. The letter comes after an independent investigation for the Isle of Man government this week found that claims that children had been left “traumatised” by inappropriate and graphic sex education taught by a drag queen in a school on the island were “inaccurate” and had led to teachers facing death threats. The prime minister confirmed a review into sex education, which will apply only to state schools in England, after a Tory MP, Miriam Cates, said children were being exposed to sex education classes that were “age-inappropriate, extreme, sexualising and inaccurate”. But teaching unions said the claims were “inflammatory rhetoric” and the review was “politically motivated”. Led by the End Violence Against Women coalition and signed by organisations including Rape Crisis, SafeLives and the Sex Education Forum, the letter argues that schools are critical to tackling abuse, but currently were being left to deal with the fallout left by misogynistic influencers and tech companies. It states: “In light of recent headlines – which have the potential to incite opposition to much-needed RSHE delivery in schools, we are seeking assurances that the upcoming review will not be unnecessarily politicised, and will be focused on what children and young people need to live happy and healthy lives, and the urgent need to do more to tackle VAWG and the rising influence of online misogyny in schools.” Related: How we educate children about sex is vital. Don’t let it be part of Britain’s toxic culture war | Gaby Hinsliff The letter states that young people are being exposed to misogynistic influencers online and “increasingly looking to porn to fill the gaps in sex education”, adding: “We urge you to commit to providing teachers with much-needed support and resources to hold space for young people to openly discuss these themes. We cannot afford the cost to these young people, and for wider society, of shutting these conversations down.” It also argues that the VAWG sector had “a long history of delivering evidence-based and trauma-informed interventions with children and young people” and should be a critical partner delivering lessons. The organisations accused the government of spending only £3.2m of the promised £6m funding package for RSHE, despite research from the DfE estimating that it would cost £59m to deliver the RSE curriculum. It also pointed to recent research from SafeLives that found teachers felt “time, resources and school prioritisation presented major barriers to effective delivery”. A government spokesperson said: “All children deserve to grow up in a safe environment, which is why we will be publishing further guidance on how schools can create a culture of respectful relationships, and teach effectively about sexual harassment, sexual violence and stamping out violence against women and girls. “We are also protecting children though our online safety bill, by ensuring technology firms will be required to enforce their age limits to stop children from being exposed to harmful material online.”</body>

    <head>‘Something special’: same-sex couple wed in UK year after fleeing Ukraine</head>
    <body>Yulia and Tetiana had spent a while deliberating over a date for their wedding before they decided it had to be 1 March – exactly a year to the day they fled the war in Ukraine. “That date should be a sad anniversary, the anniversary of us leaving our old life behind, but we decided to rewrite this story and made it our special anniversary,” said Tetiana, 42. “We lost a lot and there is a lot of evil in this world, but we’ve turned that evil into something good.” Yulia, 44, added: “We decided to exchange a bad memory for a better one.” They married at Ripley town hall in Derbyshire in the presence of their closest friends, describing it as “something very special”. On the day they wore matching T-shirts featuring the quotes “Love you to the moon and back”. “I know it’s a very common phrase, but for me it was always about our feelings and our relationship,” said Tetiana. The couple have been together for 10 years and have long wanted to get married. But same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not recognised in Ukraine, despite hope for the introduction of LGBT rights laws after the ousting of the country’s pro-Russian president in 2014. The circumstances of their nuptials are bittersweet for the couple, who always knew they would have to go abroad to get married, but never expected to be doing so in the context of the invasion of their home country. “It really was very strange that our dream came true but in such a weird way. It has been difficult,” said Tetiana. “It’s not the price we expected to pay for getting married,” added Yulia, who is originally from Russia. The couple, who worked as translators in Ukraine, said Russia’s full-scale invasion highlighted their fragility as a couple when they could not legally declare their relationship, so their decision to get married was, in part, “a pragmatic one”, said Yulia. “Officially we were just friends. We made our wills to be in favour of each other, but that is the only official link between us in Ukraine,” said Tetiana. “Love and romance is wonderful, but we are so fragile and ephemeral. Official marriage is something very legal and solid, and when there is war, it is so important for people to be protected.” The couple live in Belper, Derbyshire, where they initially moved in with their sponsors, Sarah and Helen Barley-McMullen, who had set up a group specifically to help LGBT Ukrainians reach the UK. They have since moved into their own rented flat nearby. Both are self-employed as translators, and Yulia now also works part-time in a college, while Tetiana is also looking for work to help her fully integrate into British life. “I knew we had fully settled when we got a letter from the council about our council tax. I was so glad. To me, this letter was a result of our efforts to settle and get our own place. I was like, ‘Look at me, I’m a real British taxpayer!’” said Tetiana. “But more important than that is the friends we have made. We have friends we are going to watch the coronation with, we have friends that we have Easter lunch with. And that is the most important thing: the people.” Although they hope to return to Ukraine after the war, the couple said they were thriving in their new life in the UK, particularly living among people so accepting of their relationship. “It is still unbelievably wonderful to have so much acceptance here,” Tetiana said. “We are not rejected. When we told people we were going to get married, absolutely no one said: ‘But you’re two women!’ Everyone just said congratulations. “It was and it still is so wonderful.”</body>

    <head>Two stars of The Voice of Holland charged with sex offences</head>
    <body>Two former stars of The Voice of Holland will be charged with sex offences linked to the Dutch talent show, prosecutors have announced. A case was dropped against a third man for lack of evidence. The show was taken off the air more than a year ago after a sexual misconduct scandal hit the TV ratings juggernaut in one of the most serious #MeToo reckonings to impact the Dutch entertainment world. The successful franchise began in the Netherlands before local versions were spun off around the world. Prosecutors said a 41-year-old man will be prosecuted for sexual offences involving three women in 2014 and 2018 in the Netherlands and another country. One of the cases is linked to The Voice of Holland. A fourth case, also linked to the show, was dropped. A 51-year-old man also will be prosecuted for a sexual offence that allegedly happened in February 2018 “in or around the recording studios where The Voice of Holland was recorded”, prosecutors said in a statement. They did not elaborate on the nature of the charges against the two men. The statement did not identify either man, in line with Dutch privacy rules. Dutch media, including the RTL network that aired the show, identified the 41-year-old as the rapper and series coach Ali Bouali, and the 51-year-old as the show’s pianist and band leader, Jeroen Rietbergen. Bouali’s lawyer, Bart Swier, said last year that the rapper denied any wrongdoing. The case against a third man, named in media as singer and The Voice jury member Marco Borsato, could not be proved and was dropped, prosecutors said. Rietbergen quit the show and said in a statement last year that he had had “contact of a sexual nature with some women involved in the programme and exchanged sexually tinted WhatsApp messages”. Rietbergen went on to say that after initially considering the sexual encounters “as reciprocal and equal”, he later came to understand that the women “may have experienced this very differently”. He added: “This insight has made me realise that my behaviour has been completely wrong.” The allegations of abuse at The Voice shook the Netherlands and raised questions about the handling of the allegations by the programme’s creator, reality TV king John de Mol. Rietbergen was the partner of de Mol’s sister, Linda. It is not yet clear when the two will face trial. Under the Dutch legal system, their defence lawyers can ask prosecutors to pursue further investigations before trial.</body>

    <head>Regime change: Sex Pistols star reworks God Save the Queen rhymes for king</head>
    <body>God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols is the only track in chart history to have been listed with a blank title to avoid offence. Now, the band’s former bassist is drawing another blank as he tries to rework the lyrics before King Charles’s coronation. Glen Matlock, who will perform God Save the King at the 100 Club in London on Saturday, indicated he was struggling with one or two of the rhymes. “When you start changing one word, you’ve got to change them all,” he said. “There’s not that many words that kind of rhyme nicely [with king] apart from bling, Ming. It’s not great.” He added: “I’ll probably just sort of make it up as I go along, so if you want to find out what the new lyrics might be, you’d better come on down because it’ll probably be on the spur of the moment.” Matlock, whose performance is listed on London City Hall’s programme of royal festivities this weekend, said he was now “passionately ambivalent” about the monarchy. God Save the Queen was released in 1977, the year of the queen’s silver jubilee, and had a decidedly anti-royalist bent, comparing the monarchy to a “fascist regime” – which some have argued shows it is also difficult to find words that rhyme with “queen”. Despite being banned from BBC radio and television, the song reached No 2 in the charts, held off the top by Rod Stewart – though rumours have persisted ever since that the charts were manipulated to keep the song off No 1. The band promoted the record on their own jubilee boat trip along the Thames, which ended in their arrest, and the song was rereleased last year to mark the queen’s platinum jubilee. Matlock said he would not watch Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, being crowned at Westminster Abbey as he would be “deciding what shirt to wear” and doing a sound check on Saturday. Asked what he thought of the coronation’s pomp and ceremony, he said: “There’s just so many people in destitution at the moment in this country. I think it’s kind of rubbing their noses in it a little bit. It’s all a distraction, but that’s the country we live in. “I think things are bleak for a lot of people and I think the royal family is, like, kind of pretty much the same as Love Island or [The] X Factor. They’re kind of the opium of the masses, just keeping people quiet. “This is England and that’s the way it is, what can I do about it? I just can rail against it every now and then.” The singer-songwriter has been touring as Blondie’s bassist and released his latest album, Consequences Coming, in April.</body>

    <head>Thai conservatives vow to legalise sex toys in bid to shake up election</head>
    <body>A conservative Thai political party has backed the legalisation of sex toys as it seeks to revive its appeal before a looming general election. The Democrat party representative Ratchada Thanadirek said sex toys were being smuggled into Thailand regardless of laws that prohibit their sale, and that the government was missing out on collecting taxes and regulating such products. It is illegal to sell sex toys in Thailand, and doing so can lead to a prison sentence of up to three years or a fine of up to £1,400. However, they are sold openly on street stalls in parts of Bangkok. The Democrat party, Thailand’s oldest political party, suffered humiliating losses in the 2019 election and is trailing in the polls in the lead-up to next month’s vote. There would be social as well as economic benefits to the policy, said Ratchada. “Sex toys are useful because they could lead to a decrease in prostitution as well as divorce due to a mismatch of sexual libido, and sex-related crimes.” While products were brought into the country illegally, she added, there was no quality control, resulting in some short-circuiting. The Democrat party supports establishing a sex toy industry in Thailand and would legalise the items for people aged 18 years and over. Once a key player in Thai politics, the conservative pro-monarchy party previously had strong support bases among middle-class voters in Bangkok and in the south. However, it suffered huge losses in its usual strongholds in the 2019 election and failed to win a single seat in the capital, with many voters abandoning it to support the military-backed Palang Pracharath party. The election will pit former army generals – including the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first came to power in a coup – against the Pheu Thai party, which is associated with the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Campaigning has mostly been dominated by offers of financial support, with parties promising increases in wages and cash handouts.</body>

    <head>I am married – but I am having sex dreams about a colleague</head>
    <body>I have been with my partner for six years and married for three. Recently at work, I’ve become friends with someone who is supportive and sweet and I have started to develop feelings for him. He is also in a long-term relationship but there seems to be flirting on his part, too. It has got to the point that I’ve had a few sexual dreams about him. What can I do to avoid making a mistake? Being married does not insulate one from outside attractions so there are always going to be temptations. Having private fantasies about someone else can be harmless and is no one else’s business, but I am sure that you are already aware of the potential problems that could arise if you choose to act on those fantasies. Eroticism is usually heightened when the object of a person’s desire is forbidden or out of reach and that is why so many people succumb to it. Proximity is not your friend. If you really want to avoid allowing things to develop further, it would be wise to try to socially distance yourself from your workmate. Do not be tempted to respond favourably to his flirtatiousness and do not initiate it yourself. This is undoubtedly a tall order because aside from sexual interest, I suspect you are feeling better about yourself. So it is worth thinking about what may be missing in your primary relationship and how that might have led you to this dilemma. Feeling supported and heard can be a powerful aphrodisiac.

    <head>Vatican investigating rumours of ‘sex party’ at Newcastle cathedral</head>
    <body>The Vatican is investigating rumours of a “sex party” at a British cathedral which is alleged to have happened during lockdown. As part of an investigation into the circumstances of Robert Byrne’s resignation as the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle, the Catholic church is looking into claims one of his priests invited worshippers to a private party at his lodgings. Multiple people are said to have complained that Father Michael McCoy, dean of Newcastle Cathedral, approached them to attend a party at a time when gatherings were not permitted. A diocese source told the Sunday Times said: “A number of complaints were made by individuals within the diocese after information came to light about a sex party taking place in the priests’ living quarters attached to Newcastle Cathedral.” McCoy, 57, killed himself in April 2021 four days after finding out he was subject to an investigation by Northumbria police’s child and adult protection department for child sexual abuse. He had been appointed by Byrne in 2019, replacing the popular Father Dermott Donnelly, the older brother of TV presenter Declan Donnelly. Father Donnelly has since died after an illness in July 2022. While there is no suggestion Byrne attended the party, he resigned as bishop in December, telling worshippers his office “has become too great a burden”. In a letter to clergy, which he read in St Mary’s Cathedral in Newcastle, he said: “My own discernment has caused me to recognise that I now feel unable to continue serving the people of the diocese in the way that I would wish.” He was appointed in 2019, after previously serving as an auxiliary in the archdiocese of Birmingham and as provost of the Oxford Oratory from 1993 to 2011. In a letter seen by the Sunday Times, the archbishop of Liverpool, Malcolm McMahon who is running the diocese until Byrne’s successor is appointed and is leading the investigation into his resignation, said he has been asked by the pope’s advisers to prepare “an in-depth report into the events leading up to Bishop Byrne’s resignation”. The Catholic Safeguarding Standards Agency (CSSA) last week began an “unscheduled safeguarding audit” at the diocese. Steve Ashley, the CSSA chief executive officer said the body was independent and had “full autonomy”. He said: “The scope of the investigatory work will cover any reported abuses, alleged abuses, safeguarding concerns and the culture of safeguarding in the diocese as a whole.” Ashley added: “The scope of the investigatory work will cover any reported abuses, alleged abuses, safeguarding concerns and the culture of safeguarding in the diocese as a whole.” The former chief prosecutor for the north-west of England, Nazir Afzal, chair of the CSSA, added: “There should be no doubt that we will leave no stone unturned when it comes to keeping people safe, and this includes investigating the safeguarding culture in Hexham and Newcastle.” The diocese said it voluntarily referred itself to the CSSA and the Charities Commission and it would “continue to work productively and swiftly with both organisations, learning where it needs to, not from rumours and misinformation, but from the facts and evidence provided”. It added that it “remains fully committed to safeguarding as an integral part of the life and the ministry of the church”.</body>

    <head>Sex in the Dark: will this be a new low for reality TV?</head>
    <body>Some people claim that the current proliferation of streaming services is bad for television, that this frantic scramble for subscribers will result in a gruesome and grubby race to the bottom. I don’t want to say that those people are right, but then again Peacock just made a pilot for a new reality show called Sex in the Dark. Related: Writers strike: how has it immediately affected the TV industry? According to Deadline, Sex in the Dark is a “raunchy social experiment” where a blindfolded person embarks on “intimacy tests to judge their connection, chemistry and attraction with a number of different suitors. The show culminates in a final night in complete darkness, as the singleton bed-hops with the remaining suitors to see if smell, touch, physical connection and energy is all you need to fall in love.” Before we get to the format itself, remember when the phrase “social experiment” actually meant something? Remember when it was educational, rooted in a genuine desire to see what happens to the human collective when exposed to new situations and behaviours, rather than an excuse to watch a bunch of fame-hungry nobodies bone each other through night-vision goggles? No, you’re right, me neither. Sex in the Dark doesn’t sound entirely dissimilar to Dating in the Dark, a UK reality show that aired on Sky Living in 2009. If it even shares a trace or core DNA with that show, then we should probably all brace ourselves for the worst. In Dating in the Dark, couples matched with each other in pitch-black rooms, slowly building what seemed like an unbreakable emotional connection, before the producers slammed the house lights on and – often to their tangible disgust – they realised that they had unwittingly been falling in love with an ugly person. The moral of Dating in the Dark was that, despite what you might think, it is definitely what’s on the outside that counts. It was the concept of cruelty made flesh. And that was just a show about dating. Sex in the Dark, with all the title implies, sounds even worse. Maybe they’ll flick the lights on mid-pump, and the contestants will realise they’re surrounded by mirrors, and they’ll be assaulted by their own mid-coital reflection and it’ll traumatise them forever. Anyway, Sex in the Dark doesn’t just sound awful – although it really does sound incredibly awful, like the sort of too-obvious parody reality show they’d invent for a futuristic satire about the days after the fall of civilisation – but it might just offer a hint at the direction in which television is heading. The WGA strikes are going to change how we view television. In the short term, it means no Saturday Night Live or late-night talkshows. In the medium term, we might see a pronounced drop in quality in our filmed media, like when Daniel Craig blamed the borderline-unwatchable misfire Quantum of Solace on its lack of a decent script, which was a direct result of the previous WGA strike of 2007-08. But in the longer term, the deeper issues surrounding the treatment of writers might cause platforms to turn away from expensive, buzzy, little-watched prestige drama in favour of something cheaper, crasser and unscripted. And God knows that’s exactly what Sex in the Dark is. Shows like this exist for no other reason than blunt titillation. Obviously nobody has seen Sex in the Dark yet but, at least judging by Deadline’s description, it essentially sounds like televised dogging. And not to be indelicate, but if we really wanted to watch a bunch of strangers grope and sniff each other under an artificial veil of intimacy, don’t we already have 90% of the internet for that? The scariest thing is that it might work. People might furtively buy Peacock subscriptions just to watch Sex in the Dark. In the absence of good new dramas, it might become the breakout hit of the year. It might be the sort of show that people discuss in the street. It might be heralded as the new Apprentice. And then one of the contestants might gain so much semi-ironic celebrity from their time that they run for president and win, and they’ll be inaugurated blindfolded, as they’re openly groped by their peers, and then that’ll be something we all just have to learn to live with. What I guess I’m trying to say is that people need to pay their writers.</body>

    <head>Dead Ringers review – Rachel Weisz has wicked fun as terrifying, sex-swapped twins</head>
    <body>Dead Ringers opens with a bravura set piece that establishes much of the tone for what’s to come. Twin doctors Elliot and Beverly Mantle are in a bar after a hard day of delivering babies and battling emergencies when a tiresome man decides to disturb their peace with his “friendliness” and “banter”. They take it in turns to beat the verbal crap out of the dickhead – whom they decide, over his baffled objections, to name “Larry”. This perks them up at least as much as their drinks and ends in their total victory. It’s fast, fierce, very funny, properly feminist and a fine way to open a show about a pair of gynaecologist sisters bent on revolutionising maternity and women’s health care. That at least one of the pair is already edged with delicious wildness is just a bonus. The Mantle twins are played by Rachel Weisz and what a great time she has with them both, and what a great time she gives the viewers. Beverly is the quieter, more insecure, more cerebral half of the pair and her vision of the future Mantle birthing centre revolves round the empowerment of patients and the removal of the accrued stigmas and myths around pregnancy, childbirth and women’s bits generally. Chillier Elliot is happiest in the lab and envisions a state-of-the-art facility where she can make fertility miracles happen and push the boundaries of what is feasible in bespoke babies. But I’m sure their radically different approaches will prove nothing but fruitfully complementary and definitely not tear them apart like a perineum in a breech birth. Astute readers among you will have deduced that Prime Video’s latest offering is not a new series of the radio and TV impressionist comedy series Dead Ringers. Rather, it is a sex-swapped reimagining of the 1988 David Cronenberg film starring Jeremy Irons, who did his slightly blank but sinewy thing as Beverly and Elliot – alongside a maelstrom of dreamlike scenes involving “mutant” women. Plus, a collection of specially commissioned tools to operate on them, prescription drug abuse and gothic death tableaux. It’s great. And teaches you a lot about misogyny and the fetishistic avenues that would be pursued if only more men had the time, money and access to metallurgical artists willing to specialise in speculums. Sex-swapping the plot is, therefore, an immediately interesting premise. It features a gynaecology clinic and a maternity ward so – although it may seem extreme to the fortunately inexperienced – the blood and gore we see is not so much Cronenberg body horror as an only slightly heightened depiction of the real thing. It is intimate and only as horrifying as an ordinarily bad birth might be. Imagine an unexpurgated and more stylishly shot One Born Every Minute. This aspect of Dead Ringers does feel invigoratingly new and, to use that horrible word Beverly loves so much, empowering – at least to me in the UK. How the depiction of a wand ultrasound, for example, with its unwanted intimacy that borders on violence – even when not state-mandated – plays in the US, where it is a part of the war over abortion access, I would be fascinated to know. Does it bring home the reality of what you’re asking of women, or does it secretly satisfy a punitive urge that is driving the whole rightwing regiment? Dead Ringers evokes many such questions and more, especially those of race and class, as it moves through the sisters’ patients. A subjugated surrogate here, a catastrophically ignored Black family there, unexplainable miscarriages, brutal forceps deliveries, stillbirths, simple checkups that reveal conditions that can change the course of a life – and require the abandonment of a career – form an interrogation of the ethics around birth. We are taken through the wealthy renting of poorer wombs, the dismissal of female pain, the working assumption that a Black woman is worth even less than a white woman. These extremes lead us to the limits of US medicine and can-do spirit. They form a dense, challenging backdrop to the twins’ personal dramas and damage. Coke-snorting party girl Elliot is the more obvious liability. She laughs at inappropriate moments in front of patients, she delights in their Sackler-ish, fabulously malevolent potential investor, and has a line in baby sister mockery that would do any elder sib proud. “Did you just read the Communist Manifesto this morning?” she says after Beverly laments the healthcare system. “Is,” she gasps, “is capitalism … really bad?” To be fair, she also pimps for Beverly (who is gay), chatting up women then swapping with her sister once the game is afoot. And she has the job of implanting the embryos in Beverly, who wants to have a baby, supervising the pregnancy and – at least twice so far – breaking the news that it has failed. Beverly has her hinterland, however (as anyone who agrees to be pimped for by her sister must), and the stage is set for what promises to be a rather magnificent drama, with a lean, dark, genuinely funny script by Alice Birch and two knockout performances by Weisz. Go, girls. Dead Ringers is on Prime Video.</body>

    <head>Katherine Heiny: ‘Writing about sex and relationships ends up being about infidelity’</head>
    <body>Barely two minutes into our conversation, American writer Katherine Heiny is chatting about the perimenopause and Botox for migraines, and telling an amusing story about Kazuo Ishiguro and their shared late editor in the US. “Am I gossiping?” she asks over Zoom. This month, the author of the hit novel Standard Deviation publishes her second short story collection, Games and Rituals. Following a lengthy hiatus after her first story was published in the New Yorker in 1992, when she was just 25, Heiny has been making up for lost time. Now 55, with two novels and two collections published in eight years, she is delivering on that early promise. One review in the New York Times described her fiction as “something like Cheever mixed with Ephron”, for which read highly crafted stories of quiet suburban despair that are also genuinely funny. A more contemporary comparison might be Anne Tyler with jokes. “I think Anne Tyler is very funny,” Heiny says. “But I’m not sure that that’s why people read her.” Tyler is one of her greatest influences. “I feel like everything I hope to be, I owe to her. I read her and think: ‘Wow, she’s not making a joke every paragraph, maybe I don’t have to do that, either.’ But then I go back and do that, because I’m insecure and I’m afraid people won’t read me if there’s not a joke every two seconds.” Talking to Heiny is like opening a tumble dryer mid-cycle as colourful anecdotes pile one on top of each other: there was the time on a flight when an elderly man in the aisle seat, whom she assumed had mobility issues because he kept asking her to climb over him, got up and walked around: “I basically gave this man a free lapdance!” she exclaims. “I couldn’t even be mad at him because it was so hilarious.” When she was searching for a plausible health scare for a character in her second novel, Early Morning Riser, her husband called to say he was taking his squash partner to ER as he was suffering with dizziness and blurred vision – it turned out his friend was wearing his wife’s bifocals by mistake. “I thought, I don’t even have to change this,” she says. “I can just put it right in. “If something really funny happens to me, it’s very inspiring. It makes me want to write,” she says. Most of the stories in the new collection were sparked by just such moments: her father mistaking his $4,000 hearing aid for a cashew nut and eating it (Twist and Shout); her brother telling her that a local man had been banned from all the bars in her home town for “doing donuts in the driving lot” (Sky High). The title story, Games and Rituals, was written when she was 22. She found it during a house move, and although it is set in the 1980s it only needed a little updating. Her husband read it and decided it should be the title of the new collection. “I thought: OK, they never ever go with my titles, maybe they’ll go with his.” Her husband, Ian McCredie, is a British former MI6 agent, who once received death threats from the KGB. Naturally she has a good meet-cute story: she saw him in a bar wearing a tuxedo and “nearly gave him a heart attack” by joking that he was a secret service agent. It was not until they had been dating for a while that he confessed the truth. She had never heard of MI6 and only clicked once he mentioned James Bond. “I don’t think we make sense on paper but as a couple we really work.” If you’re waiting for a novel to pop into your head fully outlined, it’s never going to happen The story of a mismatched couple who really work is the basis for Standard Deviation, the novel that made Heiny’s name in 2017. People often assume that the charismatic Audra – surely modern literature’s most compelling over-sharer – and her older, more reticent husband Graham, from whose wry, often bemused perspective the story is told, are based on Heiny and McCredie, but she is “much more Graham”, she insists. Audra was born out of an awkward exchange with an American neighbour in the Netherlands, where they lived for a time. “I just talked and talked until no words were coming out of my mouth,” she says. “That was the day I started thinking about Audra.” Heiny has the comic writer’s knack of taking a character’s idiosyncrasies – Audra’s complete lack of a filter – and making them joyfully relatable. (And she can say more in a pithy parenthesis than many writers manage in a page.) She has a genius for spinning universality out of the absurdly specific – origami, say. “Why aren’t there nice, well-rounded people who enjoy a bit of origami, the way there are nice, well-rounded people who enjoy a bit of bondage?” Audra muses loudly at a folding convention to which they take their son Matthew. Matthew, who is diagnosed with Asperger’s in the novel, is not based on Heiny’s son Angus, but she did draw on his origami obsession as a boy, in particular the eccentric characters encountered at origami club. “Oh, these origami people are intense,” Heiny says now. The youngest of three, Heiny grew up in Midland, Michigan, the headquarters of the Dow Chemical Company, where everyone, she says, was basically a scientist. Her father was a chemical engineer and her mother was a chemist. “It was pretty much as if they had brought the wrong baby home from the hospital,” she says. “Everyone was like: ‘Why can’t she do math?’” Her brothers became a chemical engineer and a software engineer, while she went to Columbia to take an MFA in poetry, followed by another in creative writing. She moved to New York to temp and do bar work until her writing career took off. Her story How to Give the Wrong Impression was rejected about 30 times before her friend told her that you are supposed to try the New Yorker first. So she sent it to the New Yorker and within a couple of days received a call from the fiction editor. Although it was wonderful to have a story accepted at such a young age, it didn’t change her life. It did land her an agent, but the prevailing wisdom was that short stories didn’t sell and she had to write a novel. “So I just sort of stalled out of fear, and waited for this novel idea to come,” she says. In the meantime, she took up writing YA novels under a pen name “to keep body and soul together”, turning out a new book every two months. “Writer’s block disappears if you have a deadline. It taught me so much.” After she married and had two sons, Angus and Hector (now 20 and 22), she was able to continue writing around childcare and the various moves for McCredie’s job. They now live in Maryland, but during a stint in London she discovered Helen Fielding’s Bridget Jones’s Diary and Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity, novels in “this weird class of their own” that made her realise the potential of comic fiction. But it was only really once her youngest son began school that she started properly writing again. “I thought: ‘Forget all this novel stuff that my agent talked about, I’m a short story writer.’ And once I decided that, I could write more short stories than I knew what to do with,” she says. Her first collection, Single, Carefree, Mellow, was finally published in 2015. There was one couple – Graham and Audra – that she found herself returning to. She had a new agent, who told her she couldn’t wait for the next chapter. “I was like: ‘Don’t call it a chapter, that freaks me out. It’s just a story,’” she says. “But I sort of backed my way into writing a novel.” When you write a book “you get an idea. And then you get another idea. And then you get another idea. And you go from there,” she says, citing one of her heroes, Stephen King. “That always seemed to me like the least helpful advice. But that’s kind of how it works. If you’re waiting for a novel to pop into your head fully outlined, it’s never going to happen.” Standard Deviation was published in 2017, followed by Early Morning Riser, about a primary school teacher who marries the local Casanova, in 2021. Not being able to write her own fiction for all those years made Heiny deeply unhappy: she would even be jealous of characters who were writers in films or on TV. “I was so afraid I didn’t know how to do it any more,” she says. “But it never really goes away.” When it comes to writing about the messy business of bringing up children, from toddler meltdowns to teenage craziness, Heiny has clearly done her time: “War is hell, yes. But so is Cub Souts,” Graham reflects in Standard Deviation. But her real subject is the even messier stuff of adult life: “I just like to write about sex and relationships, and that ends up being about infidelity a lot,” she confesses, and her fiction jangles with love triangles. “This is the true price of infidelity,” one of Heiny’s likable second wives muses in the story 561. “Twenty years later you and your husband have to help his ex-wife move out of the former family home.” She prefers to open her stories after a relationship or friendship is over. “What’s left? How do you take something positive and go on?” Taking something and making it into a story you share with someone, even if it’s just one person, that’s an act of love Despite some dark corners, Heiny’s work might be criticised for a lack of grittiness; though not all her characters inhabit Graham and Audra’s world of posh delis and dinner parties, they are always from similar backgrounds. “I would come to a halt if I started thinking: ‘Is this representative of everybody?’”, she says. “There are a lot of reasons that you can give yourself for not writing, and you don’t have to add something more to that list.” Hints of the stormy past few years work their way into the new collection, with mentions of Trump, Covid and even the British tabloids’ treatment of Meghan Markle. Heiny struggled to write during lockdown – “I would have an idea for a story and then I would sit at my desk and nothing would happen” – she thinks because she was missing the inspiration of comic encounters with strangers. Her father died during this time, and death also began to creep into Heiny’s writing. Her success came too late for either parent to fully appreciate, she says. Her mother had dementia, which Heiny wrote about with devastating acuity in the Guardian shortly after Standard Deviation was published, and although her father knew Early Morning Riser was dedicated to him, he died before it came out. “Storytelling takes two people, and now my mum is not here, I miss her telling stories, but I also miss having stuff to tell her,” she says. “I think that the act of taking something and making it into a story that you share with someone else, even if it’s just one person – that’s an act of love.” One of the few good things about getting older, she says, is that she has more stories to draw on. “But it is almost never something sad that motivates me to write. It is almost always something funny,” she stresses, as if our conversation has taken too serious a turn. Then she embarks on a story about texting McCredie to say she had some big news, shortly after the publication of Early Morning Riser; he pulled off the highway and called home, only to hear that one of his grown-up sons now liked lettuce. “For somebody or something to make me laugh is the thing I want most.” • Games and Rituals will be published by 4th Estate on 18 April.

    <head>My wife only wants sex after drinking – and I feel rejected and frustrated</head>
    <body>My wife and I are in our 40s and have a teenage son. Before we had our son we had a very active sex life and each of us would initiate almost daily: we would share fantasies all the time. After childbirth it waned, understandably, but in recent years it has dwindled to almost nothing. We both work from home and she often asks me to massage her body at night, but this virtually never leads to sex. I find it hard to initiate now, as when I do she rejects me. She has initiated a few times in the last six months, always after alcohol. When we have sex it is still good, but it feels as if she only wants it after drinking. When I have raised this she has been defensive and suggested we have a normal sex life for our age. Should I give up on the idea of regular sex and accept that satisfying myself in the bathroom is now the norm? Paradoxically, being very close to someone can lower the erotic charge. Many couples who spend all day and all night together experience lowered sexual interest. Find ways to spend time apart, perhaps pursuing separate interests such as a class or sport or hobby. Enjoying solo time with friends can also help. Experiencing oneself as an extension of another person can feel safe and cosy, but it is unlikely to inspire passion in either of you. It is only when each partner can view the other as a separate entity – as things were at the beginning of the relationship – that attraction and libido can be revived. And don’t worry about the alcohol use – unless it’s excessive. There’s no need to take it personally – your wife is just trying to relax and get herself “in the mood”.

    <head>Vulnerable UK women forced into ‘sex for rent’ by cost of living crisis</head>
    <body>Women are increasingly being forced to engage in “survival sex” because of the cost of living crisis amid worsening conditions for Britain’s most vulnerable. Charities warn that rising costs paired with years of underfunding mean women, including those with trauma and mental health issues, are having to turn to sex in exchange for housing or to meet other basic needs. Sex for rent – when landlords demand sex in return for discounted or free accommodation – is a growing problem as economic conditions tighten, they said, with perpetrators using it as a tool to abuse and control. It is particularly an issue among migrant women and asylum seekers, the Observer understands. The crisis is also making it harder for those trying to leave abusive relationships. The Beyond the Streets charity said the cost of living crisis is driving those who are already vulnerable to turn to survival sex to meet the cost of bills and rent, leading to increased exploitation and abuse. A support worker for the charity said she had spoken to women who are trapped in escorting or selling sex and several who are having to “top up” low-wage jobs with sex in order to make ends meet. A spokesperson for the charity said: “The cost of living crisis is a driver [of survival sex], and for those already vulnerable, they face considerable exploitation. There is a lack of government funding to support the needs of women, and charities are struggling as their incomes reduce, expenses increase and they are faced with more demands on their services.” Latin American Women’s Aid (LAWA) has seen multiple cases of “sex for rent” in recent months involving female asylum seekers. In one of the cases, a woman had been sofa-surfing for several months when she met a man who promised to provide her with accommodation before going on to sexually abuse her while she was sleeping. Belén Ruiz, the charity’s violence against women and girls advice centre coordinator, said: “It is unacceptable that women in such vulnerable circumstances are exposed so frequently to harassment and intimidation, being doubly victimised and unable to seek redress.” Some cases, she added, involved the harassment and abuse of asylum seekers while in public law accommodation facilities. “This makes them afraid of accessing these services, which makes them easy prey for abusers living in private accommodation.” Tilly Smith, of the Generation Rent campaign group, said sex for rent is “clearly going on”. “As we’re looking at a particularly bleak economic situation, danger grows and grows.” Women’s Aid said those contacting the organisation were in “dire and desperate need” and that rising living costs were making it even harder for people to leave abusive relationships. Lucy Hadley, the charity’s head of policy, said: “In the difficult economic context that we’re in at the moment, we know that women are experiencing increased and exacerbated levels of controlling and financial abuse from perpetrators.” Related: Selling sex is highly dangerous. Treating it like a regular job only makes it worse | Sonia Sodha Last week the home secretary, Suella Braverman, announced that she was considering a new law targeting landlords who exploit vulnerable people for sex, and launched a call for evidence. It came after the announcement last month of a trial of one-off payments to help domestic abuse victims leave abusive relationships. While Hadley said the fund was a “good first step”, the £300,000 fund fell short of the £1m they had requested, and the action on sex for rent was not tackling the root causes of the problem, which she said were homelessness, poverty and inequality. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Exploitation through ‘sex for rent’ is already illegal under the Sexual Offences Act. The government recently launched a public call for evidence which brings us closer to ending this deeply harmful trend and better protecting victims. “We are committed to stopping all forms of violence and intimidation against women and girls, including domestic abuse. While we directly fund charities to help victims leave abusive relationships, we also will invest over £230m more widely through our Tackling Domestic Abuse plan.”</body>

    <head>Republican who called drag shows a threat to kids quits after sex with intern</head>
    <body>A Republican Texas state lawmaker who once proposed banning children from attending drag shows to supposedly shield them from being groomed for abuse has resigned after he was found to have engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a 19-year-old intern. Bryan Slaton, 45, resigned on Monday while facing mounting calls from the state’s Republican party and conservative groups to step down. A state house investigation last week determined that he supplied alcohol to the intern and another young staffer, had sex with the intern after she had become intoxicated, and later showed her a threatening email while saying everything would be fine if she kept quiet about the encounter. House investigators noted as well that Slaton had asked a fellow lawmaker to keep his behavior secret. The chairperson of the investigation panel, Texas state representative Andrew Murr, said he still planned to call for a vote to expel Slaton because he remains an officer of the legislature until a successor is elected and sworn in. Slaton’s resignation letter did not address the allegations against him, which his attorney had previously called “outrageous” and “false”. Slaton said it had been an honor to serve in the legislature and thanked his colleagues. “I look forward to spending more time with my young family, and will continue to find ways to serve my community and all citizens across our great state,” he wrote. State Republican party leaders welcomed his departure and said house members should be held accountable for misconduct. “The misconduct described … should never be tolerated and is proper grounds for expulsion,” party officials said in a statement. “These actions have betrayed the trust that the people of … Slaton’s district put in him as an elected official, and he has rightly resigned.” Slaton’s legislative biography describes him as holding values and principles formed by church and family gatherings. It also cites his degrees from a Baptist seminary and work as a youth minister before he was elected to represent his Dallas-area district in 2021. Slaton’s misconduct investigation began after two 19-year-old legislative aides and a 21-year-old legislative intern filed complaints in April. Two of the women said they tried to dissuade the intern from spending time with Slaton and suggested his behavior was inappropriate. But the intern, who one complainant described as “naive”, agreed to Slaton’s request to visit his apartment. The other women went with her, and the lawmaker served them alcohol, according to the report. One of the young women drank enough to vomit, and the others were intoxicated enough to become dizzy and experience “split vision”, investigators said. Two of them eventually left but the intern stayed, according to investigators. She told her friends Slaton drove her home the next morning, stopping at a drugstore so she could obtain emergency contraception. Slaton at one point proposed to penalize the use of emergency contraception, including what is known as the Plan B pill. Besides his proposed ban on children attending drag shows, he also drew attention for seeking a vote on whether Texas should secede from the US. The Associated Press reported that between 2017 and 2021, at least 120 state lawmakers in 41 states faced public allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment. Efforts to remove them are rare, and they often successfully run again for office. The Associated Press contributed reporting Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

    <head>Raquel Welch, actor and 1960s sex symbol, dies aged 82</head>
    <body>The actor Raquel Welch has died. She was 82. The website TMZ first reported the news, citing family members who said Welch died on Wednesday after a short illness. Welch’s manager confirmed her death to the AFP News agency in an emailed statement and said she died peacefully early on Wednesday morning after “a brief illness”, without providing further details. Related: Raquel Welch: a life in pictures The actor became an international icon after appearing in a deerskin bikini in the 1966 British fantasy adventure film One Million Years BC. While the film received mediocre reviews, Welch’s cavewoman image on its poster became part of cinema history. Welch, a Golden Globe award winner, starred in more than 30 films, including Fantastic Voyage and The Three Musketeers, as well as some 50 television series in a career spanning five decades. Born Jo-Raquel Tejada in Chicago in 1940, to a Bolivian father and an American mother, Welch rose to fame and sex symbol status under her new name in the 1960s. In 2002, she told the New York Times she was proud to acknowledge her Latino roots. “I’m happy to acknowledge it and it’s long overdue and it’s very welcome,” she said. “There’s been kind of an empty place here in my heart and also in my work for a long, long time.” Related: Raquel Welch: a strong and powerful personality with a rarely-tapped gift for comedy She also said that when she set out as an actor, she was told “that if I wanted to be typecast, I would play into” her Hispanic background. “You just couldn’t be too different. My first big breakthrough part in One Million Years BC, they died my hair blond. It’s a marketing thing.” In a rare recent interview, with the Scottish Sunday Post in 2017, Welch said her two 1966 hits “made a huge difference to my career. Overnight, I found myself in demand. Before that I was not much more than an extra.” Subsequent major roles included the title role in Myra Breckinridge (1970) and a key part in The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers: Milady’s Revenge (1974). She also had a memorable cameo on the TV sitcom Seinfeld, in the episode The Summer of George (1997). Welch said her first ambition had been to be a ballet dancer, only to learn at 17 that she “really didn’t have the figure for ballet”. She said she did not mind being widely known for the fur bikini she wore in One Million Years BC. “I’m often asked if I get sick of talking about that bikini,” she said. “But the truth is, I don’t. It was a major event in my life so why not talk about it? “Almost every day I get copies of the photo sent to me for an autograph. I must have looked at that photo one million times. “I remember James Stewart telling me a long time ago never to avoid your fans or the things that your fans like about you. It was good advice.” However, she did discuss how hard it was to avoid being typecast, writing in her 2010 autobiography Beyond the Cleavage that “all else would be eclipsed by this bigger-than-life sex symbol”. She continued to act in major films, starring in Hollywood’s first interracial sex scene with Jim Brown in 100 Rifles, and as a transgender heroine in the explicit Myra Breckinridge. She won the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy or musical for The Three Musketeers, in which she plays the queen’s dressmaker. While filming Cannery Row in 1982, Welch was fired for insisting on doing her hair and make-up at home. She sued MGM studios for breach of contract, ultimately winning a $15m settlement. A lover of yoga, Welch later launched herself into the business of wellbeing, publishing her Total Beauty and Fitness program in 1984. Having long hidden her Latino origins, as an elegant 60-something she took on Hispanic roles in the American Family series on PBS in 2002 and Tortilla Soup in 2001. In 2008 and aged 68 she divorced her fourth husband, Richard Palmer, who was 14 years her junior. In later years, Welch continued to act occasionally, but also developed her own line of wigs, hair pieces and hair extensions. She is survived by her son Damon Welch and her daughter Tahnee Welch.</body>

    <head>Male contraceptive taken shortly before sex shows promise, say scientists</head>
    <body>When it comes to contraception, men may finally have a greater choice than a condom or vasectomy, with a study in mice released this week suggesting it may be possible to develop a pill that could be taken shortly before sex. With what some have described as a “global epidemic” of unplanned pregnancies, and surveys suggesting many men hold positive views about a potential “male pill”, it seems to be fertile ground. But with the field littered with false starts, are we really on the brink of a new sexual revolution? As Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, notes, there are number of challenges to developing such contraception. Related: Hopes rise for male contraceptive pill breakthrough “The biology is very hard,” he said. “We’re having to deal with destroying, stopping the production of, or disabling, millions upon millions of [sperm] cells, as opposed to a single egg [for women],” he said. What’s more, the tolerance for side-effects is very low for male contraceptives. “For female contraceptives it is different since the risk of pregnancy is weighed against the risk of contraceptive side-effects,” said Dr Melanie Balbach from Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, adding that another barrier to development of male contraceptives has been the societal view that the burden of contraception falls to the female because they carry the pregnancy. One problem is that male contraceptives that use hormones to stop sperm production can lower testosterone levels, and hence affect libido. “Making [a male] contraceptive is quite easy if you’re not bothered about having a libido, but then there’s no point,” said Pacey. To get around the problem, researchers have added testosterone, or a testosterone-like compound to the contraceptives – an approach that has been trialled in jabs, gels and pills. Although the former hit a glitch with unpleasant side-effects, trials of other methods are going well. “We completed a second trial and are still working on optimising the dosing of the pill,” said Stephanie Page, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle, although she added limited resources for this effort mean the team was also working on the gel. An alternative approach is rather more mechanical: blocking the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles, with researchers in Australia exploring the use of a hydrogel for the job that would last for two years. In effect, such an approach would offer a reversible, scalpel-free vasectomy. But Pacey thinks the answer lies elsewhere. “I’ve always thought that the way we would crack this is if somebody could find a molecule or a receptor or something on sperm that could be disabled in some way,” he said. The latest study, published in the journal Nature Communications, takes just such an approach, essentially stopping sperm from being able to move by blocking a protein called soluble adenylyl cyclase, or sAC. Crucially, the effect is temporary. “Here, we provide proof-of-concept for an innovative strategy for on-demand contraception, where a man would take a birth control pill shortly before sex, only as needed,” the authors of the study wrote. While Pacey said human trials are now needed, the approach holds promise. “As a kind of one-off prophylactic, at least on the mouse experiments, it seems to do the job,” he said. Pacey also said the approach could pave the way for a unisex contraceptive. “I don’t see why if a woman took it, it wouldn’t have the same effect on sperm,” he said. Balbach, a co-author of the work, confirmed it is an area the team are investigating. While Page welcomed the new research, she said there was a long way to go before men have access to the drug as a pill. “It is going to be a real challenge to get high enough levels of a drug into the testicle with oral dosing and that is a hurdle for much of the field,” she said, adding that as sperm can last up to five days in the female reproductive tract, an effect that only lasts hours may not work. And developing a male contraceptive is not just about the science. As Pacey notes, pharmaceutical companies also have to be onboard. “Once you have the female pill, then what’s the incentive to develop a male pill?” he said. “Why would they invest lots and lots of money going through the regulatory stuff for something that’s going to potentially halve their market?” The landscape, however could be shifting. “Pharma companies indeed did not show much interest in developing a male contraceptive in the past years so funding was low. That is changing though,” said Balbach. “Our contraceptive approach will hopefully be one of many one day,” she said. “So men get to pick what they like best.”</body>

    <head>The Artifice Girl review – talky AI sex-crime drama asks the big questions</head>
    <body>Probing the ethical implications surrounding the use of AI, Franklin Ritch’s debut feature hinges on a high-concept premise: an entirely digital avatar of a young girl named Cherry (Tatum Matthews) is used as bait to trap paedophiles in online chatrooms. Without the signature spectacle of the sci-fi genre, The Artifice Girl is a markedly low-key and small-scale endeavour, steeped in philosophical musings that ultimately seem stagey rather than cinematic. Divided into three chapters spanning decades, the film moves through a series of single locations. It starts in a police interrogation room where Ritch’s Gareth, Cherry’s creator, is questioned by Deena (Sinda Nichols) and Amos (David Girard), members of a taskforce combatting child sexual abuse. Once Gareth reveals Cherry is a virtual being, concerns arise as to whether she can meaningfully consent to interacting with men on a daily basis. As Cherry grows increasingly sentient, the same talking points are reiterated in the second section of the film, as Gareth advocates to transfer Cherry’s intelligence into a physical form. It’s questions about what it means to be human – is it the sense of free will or the ability to create art? – are not without merit, but these thorny dilemmas are tackled during cliche-laden, tiresome quarrels. The use of single locations – no doubt because of budget constraints – doesn’t help. Little is done to elevate these spaces, and the camera merely swings back and forth between characters shouting their grievances. Lance Henriksen’s gravitas as the older Gareth in the third act briefly breathes some life into the stilted dialogue, but his performance can’t save the film from its tell-not-show didacticism. Filled with complex but forgettable arguments, The Artifice Girl fails to translate its ideas into visual terms. • The Artifice Girl is released on 1 May on digital platforms</body>

    <head>Glaring flaws in the idea of excluding trans people from single-sex spaces</head>
    <body>The Equality and Human Rights Commission’s advice to the minister for women and equalities (Kemi Badenoch could rewrite law to allow trans exclusion from single-sex spaces, 4 April) appears to avoid addressing the key issue driving recent attention on the rights of trans people: access to single-sex toilets and changing spaces. They appear not to have taken the issue to a logical conclusion, an exercise that reveals two glaring flaws. First, if such spaces are to be divided by “biological sex”, this will force trans women into men’s spaces and, more alarmingly, trans men into women’s spaces. The latter will mean that a greater number of more masculine people will be present in women’s spaces, thereby making it easier for cis (or biological) men to infiltrate them. This will increase the risk to women using such facilities, not to mention the increase in risk to trans women using men’s facilities. Second, how should such a policy be policed? Fundamental statistics tells us that almost any feasible system of distinguishing between trans and cis people will reject more cis people than trans, as they make up 99.5% of the population. This will be deeply prejudicial against any women wishing to use such facilities who do not appear sufficiently feminine. There is no evidence of an increase in risk to the public at large when trans people are legally allowed to access the toilet and changing facilities appropriate to their preferred gender; there are multiple jurisdictions in Europe and North America where this is the case. Any administration seeking to increase the protection afforded to women should be pledging to criminalise sexual harassment, decriminalise abortion, introduce menstrual leave, increase funding for women’s refuges, make misogyny a hate crime, increase prosecutions for rape, and end rapists’ parental rights.

    <head>‘When people can talk about sex, they flourish’: the rise of sexual wellness</head>
    <body>Tina was 52 when her long-term relationship ended. She had experienced low libido throughout her perimenopause years, and her relationship had become “pretty much sexless by the end”, so reigniting her sex life felt like a daunting prospect. But rather than closing the book on her sexuality, Tina turned to a sexual wellness app called Dipsea, and began listening to erotic stories, as well as learning about different self-pleasure and communication techniques. “I’ve never hugely enjoyed visual pornography and this sounded like something different and worth trying out,” she says. “The app enabled me to explore my sexual wants and fantasies as well as use some of the wellness-focused content, which helped me to feel more confident when dating and navigating having sex again.” Sex is such a core part of life for many people, but also a really vulnerable, charged area of life, with lots of taboo Mei-lin Rawlinson, OMGYes She’s not alone. As attitudes to sex have liberalised, and people increasingly strive for greater physical, mental and social wellbeing, a growing industry in sexual wellness has sprung up. Whereas sex toys only used to be available from sex shops or porn magazines, they can now be bought from high street chemists. Subscription-based apps and websites are offering erotic content alongside relaxation exercises and relationship advice from trained sex counsellors. Sex is no longer taboo, but an integral part of our general wellbeing. But while investors in this industry may have hit the financial G-spot, what does it mean for the rest of us? Precisely who conceived the term “sexual wellness” is hazy, but the actor Gwyneth Paltrow is credited with catapulting it into the mainstream. In 2015, her lifestyle website Goop.com recommended that women steam-clean their vaginas for extra energy and to rebalance female hormones. Since then, Goop has sparked debates about the pros and cons of jade vaginal eggs, an “aphrodisiac warming potion” called Sex Dust – not to mention the infamous “This Smells Like My Vagina” candle. Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop has been credited with initiating the sexual wellness trend – but claims made about the benefits of some of the expensive products it sells lack evidence. Photograph: Rachel Murray/Getty Images “With the launch of things like Goop, there’s been a much broader, holistic sort of view on what sexual wellness means, and how it can benefit you to be a happier, more confident and satisfied human being,” says Mei-lin Rawlinson, chief of staff at OMGYes, an educational website about female pleasure. Around the same time Paltrow was preaching the benefits of vaginal purification, OMGYes’s founders were setting out on a mission to use science to help crack a similar nut. Sparked by conversations between friends about how women like to be touched, they realised there was a dearth of academic research on the subject, and little vocabulary for the specific things women find pleasurable. They partnered with sex researchers to conduct in-depth interviews with more than 3,000 women from across the US, using these insights to develop a trove of educational videos, infographics and how-to’s, designed to educate fee-paying members on how to access greater sexual pleasure. “Sex is such a core part of life for many people, but it is also a really vulnerable, charged area of life, with lots of taboo. We think that if people can talk about it, learn more about it, learn more about themselves, they can flourish so much more,” Rawlinson says. In the coronavirus lockdowns, sales of adult toys increased by 25%. Superdrug’s website promotes sex toys with the line: ‘Masturbation is self-celebration’. Photograph: Dima Sidelnikov/Getty Images/iStockphoto Launched in 2015, OMGYes was one of the first sexual wellness platforms, and it now has more than a million users. Research conducted by the platform, in collaboration with Devon Hensel, a professor of sociology and paediatrics at Indiana University, suggests that the benefits of membership aren’t just physical. They gave 870 women access to the website, and asked them to complete pre- and post-questionnaires to assess their sex-based knowledge and communication skills. The research, published in the Journal of Sex Research, found that after a month, women reported they had developed a wider repertoire of ways to talk about what they liked sexually and that they felt more positive and confident about understanding what felt good. “These are skills not only important for sex, but also in the context of women’s everyday lives,” Hensel says. Indeed, some of the women also reported an increase in overall agency – such as voicing their thoughts or ideas at work – as a result of this training. It’s not only educational platforms that are growing in popularity. The global sexual wellness devices market – industry speak for sex toys – was estimated to be worth $19bn in 2021. With everybody stuck at home due to Covid restrictions, this market experienced a boost. During the first two weeks of UK lockdown alone, orders for adult toys reportedly increased by 25%. But while sales of other consumer categories, such as cycling products, that experienced a “Covid boost” have since fallen back, the sexual wellness market continues to experience accelerated growth. It makes a statement when we see sex toys and pleasure products in high street places such as Boots and Selfridges Kate Moyle, psychosexual therapist “I think that’s a good data point to suggest that it is earlier in its life stage. There is more to go for in terms of the number of people who buy these products, and the number of products any one person uses,” says Jacqueline Windsor, UK retail leader for PwC. She recently co-authored a report on the sexual wellness devices market, and believes several factors may be at play. Interest in general wellness has increased over the past decade, and sexual health and wellbeing are increasingly viewed as central to this. Attitudes to sex are also liberalising, and there has been a shift in sex-toy design away from explicit brands, and towards more discreet and ergonomic models primarily targeting women and couples. “Commercially, it’s big business, but I think it makes a big statement when we see sex toys and pleasure products on high-street shelves like those in Boots and Selfridges,” says Kate Moyle, a psychosexual therapist and host of the Sexual Wellness Sessions podcast. “It makes the statement that sexual wellbeing should be there, and shouldn’t be taboo or hidden away, and this can have a huge forward impact on how we think and talk about sex, helping us to break away from its links to shame.” Pleasure isn’t the only benefit: doctors are increasingly recommending vibrator use as a way of treating and preventing conditions such as vaginal dryness and atrophy. Some of these new generation products could go a step further and enhance scientific research into sexual health and orgasm. Ergonomically designed, the Lioness vibrator is a modern iteration of the classic “rabbit” toy. What really sets it apart though, is the incorporation of sensors to measure pelvic floor movements, such as the rhythmic contractions that accompany orgasm. Paired with an app, this allows users – and (with users’ consent) sex researchers – to better understand how sexual function is affected by factors such as caffeine, alcohol, childbirth, menopause, or medical conditions such as concussion. “I always tell people that knowledge is pleasure,” says Anna Lee, co-founder and head of engineering at Lioness. “It’s an empowering tool to be curious about your body, and to learn about things that might be changing our pleasure or sexual wellness.” But the plugging of sexual wellness could also have some pitfalls. Lee worries about the potential for misinformation in the marketing of certain products, and their promotion by social media influencers. For instance, in 2018, Goop was forced to pay $145,000 in civil penalties for making the unsubstantiated claim that jade love eggs were used by women in ancient China to increase sexual energy and pleasure. A lot of these apps and products focus on the physical stuff, as opposed to what sexual intimacy means for individuals Ammanda Major, Relate “Jade is a porous material that you should never insert [into] your body, and there’s no evidence to indicate that this technique was ever used in ancient China,” Lee says. “We have to be so mindful of how we create this information that so many people are desperately seeking – because they will grab on to anything, it is such a hard topic to talk about.” Also, whereas novelty and exploration can be a turn-on for some people, for others, it can have the opposite effect. “Some people are much more comfortable with what’s familiar,” says Emily Nagoski, a sex educator and the author of Come As You Are. Another risk is that the focus on sexual wellness mounts pressure on people to do things they don’t want to do. “Everywhere you look, whether it’s on social media, telly, movies, the emphasis seems to be on the importance of sex – everyone’s having great sex, and if you’re not having great sex there’s a problem,” says Ammanda Major, head of clinical practice at Relate and a trained relationship counsellor and sex therapist. “Sex toys historically, and some of the new apps, are kind of promoting the idea that you should be having amazing sex. You should be having an orgasm. But having worked with clients for 25-30 years, what they are often asking for is they just need [the sex] to be good enough.” What these clients are really seeking, Major explains, is intimacy: the emotional closeness and trust that ideally accompanies sex. “A lot of these apps and products focus on the physical stuff, as opposed to what sexual intimacy means for individuals. I think we sometimes put a lot of pressure on people to be sexual, when actually sex isn’t that important to them.” In other cases, couples genuinely want to have more sex, but struggle to find the time and motivation to achieve this. Here, technology could help. In early 2022, Mark (not his real name) and his partner began using an app called Intimacy to track their sex life – logging both the number of encounters and their orgasm count. “We had reservations, but set ourselves a target of having sex 104 times in the year – or twice a week,” Mark says. “Rather than putting pressure on ourselves, and recognising it won’t be for everyone, we revelled in the experience – we are obviously both target-oriented. “We rapidly found ourselves ahead of our target, and reset it to 2.5 times a week, or 130 times in the year – and we ended on 134. We had a good sex life before, but this gave us the motivation to be more intimate.” Subscription-based apps, offering advice, ideas and exercises from sex therapists aimed at improving lovers’ sex lives, have attracted millions of users. Photograph: Courtesy of Dipsea The mainstreaming of sexual wellness could also trigger broader conversations about the importance of sex in people’s lives. Tina says she’s discussed using the Dipsea app with her friends, which has deepened those friendships and further helped her to build confidence in talking about sex. “I’d love to think that [these apps] can help empower people – probably mostly, but not exclusively, women – in developing their sexuality in a healthy and informed way, and developing skills and tools to better have their sexual needs met.” Rawlinson references the meditation app Headspace, as the direction in which she hopes sexual wellness is heading. “I can imagine a future where tools like OMGYes could be offered by companies in the same way that Headspace is,” says Rawlinson. “With meditation, people used to think of a cross-legged hippy on a mountain with patchouli oil at sunset. But now it’s seen as a very healthy, everyday activity, and so companies offer that as part of their HR package.” While we may still be some way off discussing sexual pleasure or difficulties with our colleagues, these issues can have a profound impact on our psychological wellbeing. And, if Rawlinson is correct, staying at home for a duvet day could take on a whole new meaning.</body>

    <head>MEPs condemn Italy’s move to stop registering children of same-sex parents</head>
    <body>The European parliament has condemned Italy’s conservative government after it demanded that a council stop registering the children of same-sex parents, in its first move to restrict LGBTQ+ rights since taking power. MEPs said they feared the move against Milan city council, which until recently had been transcribing children born overseas to same-sex couples via surrogacy or IVF into its civil register, was “part of a broader attack against the LGBTQI+ community in Italy”. The Milan mayor, Giuseppe Sala, had travelled to Brussels this week to garner support and is seeking to form an alliance made up of opposition parties to fight for the rights of same-sex-parent families. In an amendment to a 2022 report put forward by Renew Europe, a liberal and centrist group, the MEPs urged Italy to “immediately rescind its decision”, arguing that the move “will inevitably lead to discrimination against not only same-sex couples but also primarily their children” and that it was “a direct breach of children’s rights” under a UN convention. The government of Giorgia Meloni, whose far-right Brothers of Italy party promised to defend the traditional family, has also tabled a bill that would criminalise couples who go abroad to have children via surrogacy. Surrogacy is already illegal in Italy, while IVF is only available for heterosexual couples. Milan was forced to stop registering the children of gay parents after the interior ministry said it was up to the courts to rule on such a decision. Related: Crowds in Milan protest against curbs on rights of same-sex parents Thousands of people took to the streets in protest earlier this month, and other mayors are rebelling against the move. “I have always carried out these transcriptions because I am not interested in where the child is born or how,” Antonio Decaro, the mayor of Bari, told Rai TV on Friday. “If they live in my city, I am interested in how that child lives, and they must have the same rights as other children.” Italy enacted a civil unions law in 2016 when it was governed by a coalition led by the centre-left Democratic party, but the bill stopped short of legalising gay marriage, while a clause that would have allowed a person to adopt the child of their same-sex partner was scrapped after pressure from rightwing parties and the Catholic church. Italy’s LGBTQ+ community had feared that rights attained so far would be eroded by a Meloni-led government. A common feature of the rabble-rousing speeches given by Meloni, a self-described “Christian mother”, during election rallies was the reiteration of her view that a child should only be raised by heterosexual parents. She has also spoken out against “gender ideology” and “LGBT lobbies”. In the run-up to last September’s general election, Federico Mollicone, a Brothers of Italy deputy, urged the state broadcaster Rai not to screen an episode of the globally popular children’s cartoon series Peppa Pig over the inclusion of a same-sex couple in its cast of characters. “We cannot accept gender indoctrination,” Mollicone said at the time. In a TV interview this month, he sparked further criticism after saying “surrogacy is definitely a serious crime … more serious than paedophilia”. Brothers of Italy was also among the rightwing parties that blocked the passing of a law in 2021 that would have criminalised homophobia, arguing that it compromised free speech.</body>

    <head>The fantasy of sugar dating: ‘They don’t want you to be a sex worker – they just want to pay you for sex’</head>
    <body>When Lotte Latham was working as a window dresser at a major department store in London’s Knightsbridge area, she received an email from management. “It has come to our attention that prostitutes may be operating around the building at various restaurants or bars including the ground floor champagne and oyster bar,” it read. “Please report suspicious behaviour to your line manager if you witness anything unusual.” Latham bunked off the rest of the day in favour of a “slut safari”. The email had triggered two things in her: intrigue in these “unusual” ladies, and anger at her employer, both of which led to her new memoir, Dear Mr Andrews. “There was so much hypocrisy,” she says, of her time at the department store. “They assumed we would aspire to their luxury retail, but no one would ever be able to afford anything on their salaries unless they were doing sex work on the side.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As well as plush stores with bars being obvious environments for sex workers, Latham also suspects there is an overlap with sugar dating – the term for arrangements between younger women (sugar babies) and older men (sugar daddies) bearing gifts and allowances – because of the sheer number of men she saw there, flexing their credit cards for their younger dates. Sugar dating is something Latham had tried herself for a few years, before realising she’d prefer to work as an escort and be paid fair and square. Sugar apps exist in this grey zone, saying they don’t endorse money transactions … while saying you can earn $2,000 a month off it Dear Mr Andrews charts that journey in experimental form. Latham’s Tracey Emin-like drawings are scattered throughout, but Latham herself is a blank canvas, parachuting us into different engagements across Europe without the tethers of backstory. I can provide a few snippets though: Latham is a London-based artist whose arthouse videos are shown around European festivals. In her personal life, she always falls for “penniless Marxists”. Since Australian author Holly Hill published her bestselling memoir Sugarbabe in 2008, about placing an ad to find an older benefactor offering a “generous weekly allowance”, sugar babes and daddies have infiltrated mainstream parlance. There’s a thriving erotic fiction subgenre and podcasts such as the Sugar Daddy Formula and the Sugar Baby Confessionals. Websites such as Let’s Talk Sugar and Sugar Daddy Sites that offer advice and coaching, while tabloid s regularly run stories gawking over glamorous babies with five-star lifestyles. And terms like “high-value dating” and “hypergamy” have had hundreds of millions of views on TikTok, detailing tactics for women to meet “high-value” men – meaning, those with money. Related: ‘Sales funnels’ and high-value men: the rise of strategic dating The surge of interest since Latham first tried sugar dating in 2015 means the scene has reached saturation point. “I’ve heard of there being 25 women to every man,” she says. “When there are more providers, there’s higher competition and people trying to barter you down on prices, saying, ‘My last girl did this,’ which you can’t verify. My last appointment was with a guy trying to do a try-before-you-buy blowjob in the back of his car.” Latham finds the language of sugar dating – “pampering”, “sponsor”, “mutually beneficial relationships” – deeply disingenuous. “There are all these codified things like ‘I don’t want a professional’, which means they don’t want you to be a sex worker, they just want to pay you for sex,” she says. “The stigma of being a John doesn’t get talked about as much as the stigma of being a sex worker, but the idea of being a John is seen as desperate and they like to think of themselves as people that can access young hot pussy because of their wealth and status. It’s an ego-affirming thing. The fantasy is that it’s old-fashioned chivalry.” With escorting, I can check other people’s profiles and see what people are charging … I can see if a punter’s had a bad review Latham makes it clear she’s not looking down on women who want to be sugar babies. “I’ve just got a bee in my bonnet that society celebrates women getting a rich boyfriend, but talks down at prostitutes for being grotesque,” she says. “Sugar apps exist in this grey zone, saying they don’t endorse money transactions, it’s just a dating site for people who want to find a successful man or a bright young thing. They don’t want to be associated with the adult industry. At the same time as saying you can earn $2,000 a month off it.” She points me towards a 2018 advertisement for the dating website Seeking – or SeekingArrangement as it was then known – called Sugar Baby University. Students who signed up to the dating website with .edu email addresses were offered free premium membership, with the enticement of receiving “an average of $2,400 per month in allowances and gifts. Go from broke to bespoke and hack the student debt cycle!” The UK’s 2022 National Student Money survey, meanwhile, found that 3% of students had done sex work and 8% would consider it in a cash emergency. Escorting is a safer and simpler option, Latham has decided. “I just don’t like the idea of not being able to operate as a business,” she says. “Back in ancient Greece, prostitutes had guilds. They were business women in their own right. With escorting, I can check other people’s profiles and see what people are charging. There’s a two-way reviewing system, so I can see if a punter’s had a bad review from someone, and I can ask for a deposit.” Latham hopes people won’t go in expecting Dear Mr Andrews to be a glamorous Secret Diary of a Call Girl-style beach read. Actually, it’s more in the realism vein of a recent spate of Australian titles written by sex workers: Come by Rita Therese; Nothing But My Body by Tilly Lawless; Money for Something by Mia Walsch and Happy Endings by Bella Green. Similarly to many of those, Latham’s book is a call to arms to decriminalise sex work, which she considers increasingly urgent as the cost-of-living crisis sees more women signing up as escorts, to fewer clients. “Therefore the prices go down and people can push things like not wearing condoms,” she says. “The exploitation level goes up when there’s the need.” She quotes a slogan she once saw, on a sex work strike that marched through London “Fuck the patriarchy, but not for free.” Dear Mr Andrews by Lotte Latham is published by Guts Publishing and is out now</body>

    <head>The lawyer whose sex trafficking case against Instagram could spell trouble for big tech</head>
    <body>On 14 March 2022, Annie McAdams, a personal injury lawyer running a small firm in Houston, Texas, filed a civil action suit on behalf of one of her clients. The plaintiff was a 23-year-old woman, who had endured years of sexual exploitation at the hands of a convicted trafficker. The defendant was one of the most powerful technology companies in the world. Contained within McAdams’s federal suit was a series of allegations that Meta – the owner of Facebook and Instagram, which are used by more than 3 billion people every day – had knowingly created a breeding ground for human trafficking and was actively facilitating the buying and selling of people for sex online. The lawsuit alleges that the company’s products – particularly Instagram – connects vulnerable victims with human traffickers and sex buyers, and provides traffickers with the means to groom those victims. It says that human trafficking victims are regularly posted on Instagram and sold for sex against their will and claims that the company has failed to take adequate steps to stop this. In the court documents, the plaintiff – who we are calling Shawna – says she was 18 when she was first contacted on Instagram by a man she didn’t know. She claims that the man – referred to as RL in the court papers – sent her messages on her public profile and on Instagram’s direct-messaging service and that this campaign of grooming led to her agreeing to meet him in person. Two days after their first meeting, she claims that RL began to sell her to sex buyers on Instagram. She claims that RL posted explicit pictures of her on Instagram along with emojis such as dollar signs, crowns and roses, widely recognised by law enforcement and trafficking experts as indicators of commercial sex adverts. “[Meta Inc] knew that the use of these codes were blatant red flags … and were actually sex trafficking advertisements designed to sell her for sex, but [Meta] did nothing to remove or prevent those repeated posts, despite having the ability to do so,” the court papers say. Shawna alleges that over the course of a year she was sold on Instagram to multiple sex buyers. She says she was threatened with homelessness or violence by RL if she refused to fulfil her “quota” of sex acts. She went on to testify against RL in a federal criminal trial in Texas and he was subsequently sentenced to 40 years for sex trafficking. However, the lawsuit claims that at the time it was filed to the court in Houston, Instagram had not removed the trafficker’s Instagram account. McAdams claims that despite repeated attempts by Meta to get the case dismissed, Shawna, who is seeking damages from the company, is now on the brink of taking her civil claim against Meta further through the US court system than any other case has managed. She believes that there are now no serious legal obstacles between her case and bringing Meta before a jury in 2024 to face allegations that it played an integral role in the trafficking of her client. A spokesperson for Meta said that Meta prohibits sex trafficking on its platforms “in no uncertain terms … we vigorously deny the claims made against Meta in this suit.” It is not the first time that Meta – in either of its guises as Meta Platforms Inc or Facebook Inc – has faced lawsuits containing similar allegations. Yet in the two decades since it was launched by Mark Zuckerberg from a Harvard dorm, his company – which rebranded from Facebook to Meta in 2021 – like other technology companies with servers based in the US, has never faced prosecution for illegal and harmful content and activities on its platforms. For decades, social media companies have sheltered behind an obscure clause in the 1996 Communications Decency Act – called section 230, which concludes that technology companies are not legally responsible for crimes that occur on their platforms. Section 230 states that providers of “interactive computer services” – which includes the owners of social media platforms and website hosts – should not be treated as the publisher of material posted by users. The problem is not section 230. The problem is 20 years of bad precedent and the court’s misinterpretation Annie McAdams, lawyer Since the act was passed, tech companies such as Meta have argued successfully in US courts that section 230 provides them with immunity from prosecution for any illegal content published on their platforms, as long as they are unaware of that content’s existence, building a fortress of legal precedent. Section 230 does not shield online platforms from federal criminal charges if they are seen as responsible for facilitating trafficking. And a recent amendment to section 230 – known as the Fosta-Sesta package – means that companies can be held liable under state and civil laws but must be shown to have knowingly assisted or facilitated sex trafficking. Other cases have attempted to swerve section 230, but in her federal suit, McAdams is instead tackling it head-on, arguing that it has been misunderstood and was never intended to protect a social media company which, she claims, knowingly allows crimes against children to occur on its platforms. McAdams says that the only way to stop social media platforms being used as online marketplaces for sex trafficking is through the courts. Photograph: Callaghan O’Hare/The Guardian “The problem is not section 230,” McAdams says. “The problem is 20 years of bad precedent and the court’s misinterpretation of 230. In no place does it say that there should be immunity. There is a big difference between immunity and no liability.” McAdams’ decision to tackle the interpretation of liability under section 230 comes as changing legal winds across the US challenge the lack of accountability granted to tech companies. The debate around section 230 has become highly polarised. Those who want the clause amended say that the legal safe haven it has provided for internet companies means they have no incentive to root out illegal content on their sites. Related: How Facebook and Instagram became marketplaces for child sex trafficking Others warn that amending section 230 would curb free speech and dismantle democratic values online. Some sex worker groups also warn that undermining section 230 would harm their business and make them unsafe. McAdams says that the only way to stop social media platforms being used as online marketplaces for sex trafficking is through the courts. Along with Shawna’s case, McAdams has several similar suits filed against Meta across the US in which other plaintiffs allege that Meta enabled, facilitated and profited from their sex trafficking. “After years of being silenced, I hope my clients will have their day in court,” she says. “Their bravery and resilience has started something that could finally see the internet become a safer place for children and open the door for other survivors to be heard. I have many, many more victims waiting to have their cases reviewed. This is just the start.” A Meta spokesperson said: “Sex trafficking is abhorrent … we cooperate with law enforcement so they can find and prosecute the criminals who commit these heinous acts, and we use technology to help keep this abuse off our platforms.” “Our goal is to prevent people who seek to exploit others from using our platform, and we work closely with anti-trafficking experts and safety organisations around the world to inform these efforts. We will continue to join with others across society in the fight against sex trafficking and the predators who engage in it.”</body>

    <head>OnlyFans warning to NSW nurses and midwives prompts ‘sex shaming’ accusation</head>
    <body>An email sent by the Nursing and Midwifery Council advising health practitioners against setting up profiles on OnlyFans is “unreasonable” and amounts to “sex shaming”, a public policy expert has warned. OnlyFans is a content subscription service where users pay for exclusive content from creators, and is most popular for explicit adult content. In an email sent to practitioners on Wednesday, the Nursing and Midwifery Council of New South Wales cautioned that OnlyFans profiles could be a “distraction for patients” and bring the profession into disrepute if a health practitioner was recognised and reported for their conduct. Related: Queensland human rights commissioner says police must watch for vigilante activity The Health Care Complaints Commission told the Sydney Morning Herald it had “received complaints relating to health practitioners’ use of OnlyFans”. The council said in its email it might consider whether social media use in a practitioner’s private life raised concerns about fitness to hold registration, even where there was no identifiable link to their profession. According to the Fair Work Commission’s unfair dismissals benchbook, an employer has the right to supervise the private activities of employees in “exceptional circumstances”, but “it is not sufficient for the employer to simply assert that the conduct will in some way affect the employer’s reputation”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Anna Boucher, an associate professor of public policy and comparative politics at the University of Sydney and a practising solicitor, said only certain occupations – where employees were “people with public profiles giving public comment” – could be reasonably held to expectations around reputation. Nursing was a public role, but not a high-profile one, she said. “Unless they are a really important figure in the hospital, I don’t really understand why it matters. Does anyone who has a role where other people might see them have to create an alternate reality to be accepted in the workplace? It is unreasonable.” The council’s email puts forward three scenarios for discussion. In one of them, a patient recognises a nurse from OnlyFans, prompting a colleague to report the nurse because “her behaviour has brought the profession into disrepute”. “I do think that is sex shaming,” Boucher said. “It is her private time. She wasn’t advertising this. It was a nosey former patient. The only argument you can make is it is hurting some perception of what the profession is.” In another scenario, a senior manager gives a junior preferential rostering after seeing her OnlyFans page. He then messages the junior on her OnlyFans “asking for the favour to be returned”. Michael Whaites, the assistant general secretary of the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association, said in a statement: “There is no excuse for sexual harassment, especially within a workplace. Because someone chooses to participate in online platforms like OnlyFans does not excuse this, not from managers or employers, or from customers or patients.” Most employees require an employer’s permission for external earnings, with employment contracts commonly including a condition that second sources of income must first be checked by the primary employer. The entry wage for a registered nurse caps at $65,000. The average is just over $80,000 a year. In the past two years thousands of nurses have been on strike over pay and conditions. Boucher said the issue “is really saying something quite powerful about the cost-of-living pressures”. “We know the cost of living is rising, and inflation is at almost 8%,” she said. “You can understand why a nurse would want to go and do that work. They might think, I’ve been striking for a pay increase for a long time, and it hasn’t been delivered. I can do this in my own time … and it is better money than nursing. “Do you really have the right to deny someone that opportunity … if you are only paying them $60,000 a year?” Related: Facebook ads opposing a ban on vaping in Australia failed to disclose tobacco company backing In a statement the Nursing and Midwifery Council of NSW said its “paramount legal obligation is to protect the public”. “The most recent newsletter aimed to reinforce the professional standards for nurses and midwives, including how inappropriate conduct on social media can lead to complaints of unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct. “The social media guidelines are developed by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia to ensure that nurses and midwives are meeting their obligations under the National Law.” The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association said it does not object to practitioners having profiles on other social platforms and earning a second income, but it encourages nurses and midwives to familiarise themselves with AHPRA’s Social Media Guidance “regardless of whichever social media platform they engage with”.</body>

    <head>Michel Houellebecq sex film to be released despite attempt to stop it</head>
    <body>A Dutch art collective can release an experimental erotic film showing the French novelist Michel Houellebecq having sex with young women in spite of the author’s attempt to stop its circulation, an Amsterdam court has ruled. Amsterdam’s district court on Tuesday afternoon dismissed a legal complaint by Houellebecq and his wife, Qianyun Lysis, that had aimed to curb the distribution of the film KIRAC 27 by Keeping It Real Art Critics, as well as a trailer that was uploaded on the art collective’s website last month but has since been taken down. The clip shows the 67-year-old enfant terrible of French letters in pyjamas lying on a bed next to a woman in a nightie, smoking and laughing. “I told him that I knew many girls in Amsterdam who would sleep with the famous writer out of curiosity,” a voiceover says. According to the court’s verdict, the idea to have the author of Submission and Atomised star in an experimental porn film to “counteract his gloom” had first been proposed to KIRAC’s co-director Stefan Ruitenbeek by Houellebecq’s wife at a dinner in Paris in autumn 2022. Via email, Houellebecq and Ruitenbeek subsequently discussed plans to make “a work of art, in which the distinction between fiction and reality takes shape as a game with the rancorous paranoia of your enemies”. Upon arriving in Amsterdam for filming on 1 December 2022, the writer signed a release form, agreeing to appear in a film that “may or may not include explicit content”. The agreement’s only restriction was that the film would not show Houellebecq and his genitals in the same shot. Summarising the original plan for the film, the court said the split between images of faces and genitalia “would leave the viewer in wonder as to whether Houellebecq actually participated in the sex scenes, or whether a stand-in in them was acting for him”. However, on 23 December, three days before the scheduled end of the shoot, Houellebecq walked out on the project. In a letter published on his personal website, the writer said his and the Dutch director’s “conceptions of artistic work were radically opposed”, likening it to “gutter journalism”. In his complaint to the Amsterdam court, Houellebecq argued that he was struggling with severe depression at the time of signing the agreement and had drunk several glasses of wine. The court dismissed his objection for lack of a doctor’s certificate proving Houellebecq’s condition, and questioned whether wine had been drunk before rather than after the signing of the agreement. If the intended ambiguity of the art film had narrowed, the verdict concludes, “it is at least as much the result of Houellebecq’s attempts to prevent disclosure of the footage”. Earlier this month another court in Paris rejected a complaint in which Houellebecq had argued the film’s trailer damaged his private life and honour, as well as spreading lies about his wife. The film’s planned premiere on 11 March was nonetheless postponed due to the two lawsuits. The legal row has pitted one of the most flamboyant polemicists of the European literary world against a Dutch group with a similar taste for courting controversy. Under the KIRAC guise, artists Stefan Ruitenbeek, Kate Sinha and Tarik Sadouma have since 2016 released short films on YouTube that explore and make fun of the international art world, often mingling factual and fictional elements in ways that are hard to keep apart. In interviews, Houellebecq has repeatedly defended the principle of women being paid to have sex, heavily criticising his home country for making prostitution illegal in 2016. In his 2001 novel Platform, a semi-autobiographical protagonist called Michel wanders around Thailand as a sex tourist. While legal action had delayed the editing of KIRAC 27, Ruitenbeek said he expected a final cut of the film, including the disagreement with its star performer, to be released in May. “It has always been my intention to make an artwork with integrity”, Ruitenbeek said in a statement. “Hopefully Michel is happy with the result.”</body>

    <head>Since having our third child my wife seems too busy for sex</head>
    <body>I am in my 40s and married to the love of my life. I am a very sexual and sensual man. I derive pleasure from pleasing my wife and connecting with her physically and emotionally. However, since having our third child two years ago I feel that we have lost our physical connection. We still have sex but it is less frequent than I would like and it is usually rushed because the kids are at home or we are off to run errands. At times, I feel as if my wife is so mentally busy juggling work and the kids that she doesn’t think about sex and intimacy as much as I do. It is perfectly normal for a woman with three children and a job to be less available for sex than she was when she had fewer responsibilities. Many couples benefit from planning time together for sex and it sounds as though this would be very useful for you both. If possible, find specific times to get help with childcare and do something fun together and make love elsewhere. I know this is a change from the past when you could have sex more spontaneously, but it is your current reality. You both need to carve out this special time for intimacy as your sexual reconnection will not happen without it. Try to be patient, support your wife as much as you can and remember that for many busy women the sexiest thing you can do is wash the dishes, organise the fridge and empty the bins.

    <head>Isle of Man school got death threats after false sex education reports</head>
    <body>Teachers at a school on the Isle of Man have faced death threats over false reports that children had been left “traumatised” by inappropriate and graphic sex education taught by a drag queen, the island’s government has said. Staff at Queen Elizabeth II school had faced a “tirade of abuse” ranging from “threats to turn up at the school, demands for staff to be dismissed, to demands for people to be arrested and executed”, according to the education minister Julie Edge. It came after various news reports that a drag queen told a child to leave the class after they said there were only two genders and that children were taught about oral and anal sex, as well as being shown graphic pictures of gender reassignment surgery, in September last year. The government launched a three-stage independent investigation in response to the claims and found the reports were “inaccurate” and had had a “detrimental impact” on staff at the school. “Public references to a drag queen delivering a session at a drop-down day at QEII in September 2022 are inaccurate, but it is understood that the guest speaker referred to does occasionally perform as a drag artist,” Edge told the island’s parliament. The report found that at no point did a speaker remove a child from the classroom and that sex was not mentioned in the class at all, which was wrongly reported as a sex education lesson. The investigation found that a child had asked how many genders there were and the speaker, who had been invited as a guest to talk about “gender-neutral language and the concept of gender in the LGBTQ+ environment”, responded that there could be as many as 72 gender identities. Later, a child was briefly taken outside the classroom by a teacher to “remind the pupil of the school’s expectations that all pupils are entitled to their own opinions, and that they do not have to agree with a guest speaker, but they do have to show respect”. Edge said “a number of pieces of the information have been conflated and misrepresented”, including a video showing a document about trans issues purporting to be from the school, which was not. One resident told the Guardian how reporting of the story had triggered a “tsunami of bigotry, to put it mildly” in response. Another resident and an LGBTQ+ advocate, Alan Shea, described the reports and the resulting social media comments as “despicable”. “It is absolutely outrageous what these people are saying – it’s like we’re living in the dark ages,” he said. Shea also received threatening messages after speaking to the local paper about the hate the school was getting, claims that are being investigated by the police. Edge said the power of social media to “mislead and, as such, negatively impact our community” should be recognised. “In this instance, social media has turned elements of a community against a school, a school that served that community loyally for many years. It has also caused elements of our wider community to turn against each other.” She added: “There have been malicious accusations and comments, which continue to be received by our staff and myself directly through emails, letters, telephone calls and shared across social media platforms, and they have continued to have a detrimental impact upon many individuals.”</body>

    <head>Same-sex marriage row looms over Church of England synod</head>
    <body>The repeal of a century-old act of parliament that allows the Church of England to govern itself is among options being considered by MPs frustrated at the church’s continued refusal to offer marriage equality to same-sex couples. Conservative and Labour MPs are weighing up several options aimed at bringing the C of E into line with the law of the land with regard to same-sex marriage. Chris Bryant, Labour MP, chair of the standards and privileges committee and former Anglican priest, said the church’s position was “causing very real pain and trauma. If the church won’t act, then parliament should give it a push.” Some MPs have asked whether the C of E’s refusal to allow same-sex marriage makes it incompatible with its special status as the state church. When they put that last week to Justin Welby, archbishop of Canterbury, he reportedly replied that he would rather see the C of E disestablished than risk the global church fracturing over the issue. This week, the C of E’s governing body, the General Synod, will consider a recommendation from bishops that clergy be allowed to bless same-sex civil marriages while the church preserves its bar on same-sex weddings. The proposal is intended to settle 40 years of painful divisions and often bitter arguments over sexuality. But it has infuriated both campaigners for LGBTQ+ equality and conservatives who insist that biblical teaching on marriage must be upheld. The synod debate is likely to be impassioned, with an attempt by progressives to overturn the same-sex marriage ban and some conservative evangelicals warning they could leave the C of E. A group of about a dozen MPs met last week to consider options that could put parliament and the C of E in a head-on confrontation. They discussed moves to repeal the 1919 Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act, which devolved legislative power from parliament to the C of E. Until 1919, parliament passed legislation governing the C of E’s affairs. Legislation passed by the General Synod still requires parliamentary approval. Other options include stripping the C of E of its exemption from the Equality Act; removing the quadruple lock on the Same-Sex Marriage Act that states no religious organisation can be compelled to marry same-sex couples; or passing a simple law permitting individual parishes and priests to conduct same-sex marriages. The parliamentary ecclesiastical committee, a body of cross-party peers and MPs that reviews C of E legislation, could refuse to recommend approval of any new measures until the church offers equal marriage to same-sex couples. “If synod does not make greater progress than is contained in the bishops’ recommendations, I think parliament would take this matter very seriously,” said Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP and former cabinet minister. Bryant said support for marriage equality in the C of E would win cross-party support in the Commons and the Lords, with little opposition from Tory MPs “as long as it’s a permissive move rather than a mandatory move”. Sir Peter Bottomley, the veteran Conservative MP, told the Commons that the 1919 act could be amended, and that “the Church of England needs to wake up”. Chris Loder, another Tory MP, said: “Maybe the synodical arrangements which we have are not fit for purpose, and we should look to reform them.” On Thursday, Bryant asked Penny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, to “allow time for legislation to push the Church of England into allowing same-sex marriages to be conducted by parishes and clergy who want to do so, if synod does not act.” Equality campaigners suggested that Mordaunt’s reply – “I know this is an issue that many members of this house will wish to pursue” – left the door open for legislative action. Outside parliament, the comedian and television presenter Sandi Toksvig met Welby to relay her distress over the C of E’s stance on gay sex and same-sex marriage. “The state church and the society it purports to represent are not remotely in step,” she said after the meeting. “I do not intend to wait upon the church. In the next few weeks, I will be reaching out to the LGBT+ community and all our allies to see what can be done. The present position is untenable.” On Friday, Toksvig launched a petition calling for the removal of the 26 seats in the House of Lords reserved for C of E bishops. MPs present at last week’s meeting with Welby were “startled” by his statement that he would prefer disestablishment to fracture, according to one. But both Welby and his predecessor, Rowan Williams, have previously said that disestablishment would “not be a disaster” and “not the end of the world”. “The idea of having an official state religion in the 21st century is an absurd anachronism,” said Stephen Kettell, who teaches politics and religion at Warwick University, pointing to recent census data showing that less than half the population describe themselves as Christian. “Disestablishment could be revitalising and re-energising for the Church of England. Or it could be the last thing propping up the church. But it’s hard to see it moving forward when you consider the scale of the problems facing the country.”</body>

    <head>Kemi Badenoch could rewrite law to allow trans exclusion from single-sex spaces</head>
    <body>Kemi Badenoch is considering changing the Equality Act to allow organisations to bar trans women from single-sex spaces and events, including hospital wards and sports. The change by the equalities secretary would redefine sex in the 2010 act to specifically refer to legal protections for “biological sex” – the sex assigned at birth. Badenoch asked the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to advise on the change, it emerged on Tuesday. The equalities watchdog said the new definition would make it possible to exclude trans people from same-sex spaces even if they hold a gender recognition certificate (GRC). The recommendation was welcomed by the gender-critical campaign group Sex Matters, but prompted anger from the LGBTQ+ group Stonewall, which said it “risks opening yet another chapter in a manufactured culture war that will see little benefit to women, cis and trans alike”. Government sources said they were looking carefully at the EHRC response, warning the legislation was complicated. But Badenoch is being backed by Downing Street to continue looking at the possibility of a change. In a letter to Badenoch published on Tuesday, the EHRC said the change would extend protections for trans men who use maternity services, as they would have rights based on their biological sex. Seven other implications of the change, as cited by the watchdog, would make it simpler for groups and services to exclude trans people even if they hold an official certificate recognising their gender. Badenoch had written to the EHRC earlier this year to ask them to provide their view on whether sex, a protected characteristic under the 2010 Equality Act, would benefit from clarification that it refers to biological sex. The EHRC said the government should carefully consider that any change could have “possible disadvantages for trans men and trans women”. Its letter said: “There is no straightforward balance, but we have come to the view that if ‘sex’ is defined as biological sex for the purposes of EqA, this would bring greater legal clarity.” The EHRC said currently sex was defined as legal sex, meaning that the protected group included those with a gender recognition certificate. Changing to a biological definition would mean single-sex groups could then restrict membership to biological women or men, the EHRC said, giving the example of lesbian groups or women’s-only book groups, which would be able to then exclude trans people. It also says political parties could restrict trans women with a GRC from benefiting from “women-only” shortlists and other measures aimed at increasing female participation. The EHRC said it was a “perceived anomaly” that trans men could not benefit but trans women could. The change would also allow employers to restrict positions to biological women or men, with the EHRC giving the example of a warden in a women’s or girls’ hostel. A biological definition of sex would also make it simpler for hospitals to restrict trans women from certain female wards, where at present service-providers must “conduct a careful balancing exercise to justify excluding all trans women”. And the EHRC said organisers would more easily be able to exclude trans women with a GRC from women’s sports without having to prove that it was necessary to do so in the interests of fairness or safety. The letter also warned that there were areas in which the change could have unintended consequences, such as making it easier for trans men to bring pay discrimination claims but not trans women, because they could claim on the basis of biological sex. The EHRC’s chair, Kishwer Falkner, said the change “could bring clarity in a number of areas, but potential ambiguity in others”. “Our response to the minister’s request for advice suggests that the UK government carefully identify and consider the potential implications of this change,” she said. “There is a clear need to move the public debate on issues of sex and gender to a more informed and constructive basis. This would be welcomed by the many who do not take the polarised positions currently driving public debate.” The EHRC said there was also a clear need to evolve the language used in the 2010 act, which “refers to trans people as ‘transsexuals’, and uses the terms ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ at times interchangeably, with the requirement on employers to report ‘gender pay gaps’ in fact a duty to report on pay differences according to the protected characteristic of sex”. Stonewall said the letter from the EHRC offered “no substantive evidence of demand for this work” and said the group did “not see a world where cis women are desperate to exclude trans women from their spaces”. “The EHRC is right to consider how trans men miss out on provisions and protections, but it is fundamentally wrong to imply that trans women do not experience sexism, which cuts far beyond biology,” a spokesperson said. “We would also expect the EHRC to make further reference to some of the challenges defining ‘biological’ sex, discussion around how these measures would interact with the Equality Act’s protection for people who are ‘perceived’ to hold protected characteristics, and how rights for intersex people might be considered.” Sex Matters, which started a petition to amend the Equality Act, said: “This is a measured and thoughtful analysis from the EHRC. We are confident that our proposed amendment will deliver substantial improvements in clarity and fairness, but for now we are content with the conclusion that it merits further consideration.” • This article was amended on 29 April 2023. An earlier version suggested the EHRC had said hospitals would have to conduct “a careful balancing exercise” in order to exclude trans women from female wards if the changes went ahead; in fact the EHRC was describing the steps a hospital must take under present rules.</body>

    <head>Sunak tells Piers Morgan ‘biological sex matters’ – as it happened</head>
    <body>8.59pm GMT Sunak cites his football team Southampton and their famous escapes to avoid relegation from the Premier League in the 1990s, comparing it to his task as PM. He also agrees for Morgan to interview him again at the end of the year to judge whether he has fulfilled his objectives. And that brings the interview to an end. 8.55pm GMT Sunak passes the pint of milk question, replying 90 pence. 8.50pm GMT On the issue of women’s safety, Sunak admits we “haven’t done a good enough job on that in the past”. Updated at 8.50pm GMT 8.49pm GMT Sunak said the Isla Bryson case in Scotland shows some of the challenges of gender transition. He added: “We should have enough compassion and tolerance for those who are questioning their gender and identity, and we will always be supportive of that. But we have to recognise the challenges that poses for women’s safety. And that’s why biological sex matters.” Updated at 8.51pm GMT 8.43pm GMT On whether he will send jets, the PM doesn’t give a direct answer but talks about the tanks the UK provided and that they are always in a dialogue with Ukraine. He adds that using jets require months of training. Updated at 8.45pm GMT 8.41pm GMT Sunak says he has no problem with Boris Johnson’s comments about Ukraine and visit to the country. 8.40pm GMT Sunak reiterates he will publish his tax returns soon. 8.38pm GMT On whether he has benefitted financially through pharmaceutical companies like Moderna, Sunak said he does not know what investments he has made because they are in a “blind management arrangement”. 8.36pm GMT On the bullying allegations surrounding Dominic Raab, Sunak says “I believe in due process, people should have a fair hearing, that’s why we have an independent adviser.” 8.35pm GMT On his contentious appointments including Nadhim Zahawi, Suella Braverman and Gavin Williamson, Sunak says the country can judge him on how he has handled the situations. He said most of the issues that have arisen were before he was appointed. 8.33pm GMT On nurses’ pay, Sunak says tackling inflation has to be one of the priorities. Updated at 8.34pm GMT 8.32pm GMT On the £1000 parking charges returning for NHS staff in England since the pandemic ended, Sunak looks rattled and said he has put support for NHS trusts to be able to support their staff. Sunak dodges the question about the parking charges and then says “he is happy to look at that”. Sunak said the government has reinstituted nurses’ bursaries and provided a £1000 training budget. Updated at 8.35pm GMT 8.30pm GMT Sunak added: “I would love to give the nurses a massive pay rise. It would make my job easier. It’s about choices. Right now there is a record amount of money going into the NHS. We have to put that in lots of different places, we need more doctors, nurses, scanning equipment.” Updated at 8.31pm GMT 8.29pm GMT On the nurses’ strike and criticism of his negotiating stance with the unions, Sunak said nurses should be an exception because they do an incredible job. He says the government did treat them as an exception, citing the public sector pay freeze during the pandemic with the exception of NHS workers. Updated at 8.29pm GMT 8.25pm GMT Sunak is asked if he has asked the home secretary to dial down her rhetoric about migrants. The PM said: “People are frustrated with this situation. I am frustrated by this situation.” On the point about language, he said: “We should always remember we are a compassionate country. [Suella Braverman] believes that, everyone believes that. But we are not a soft touch. We believe in fairness as well.” Updated at 8.27pm GMT 8.22pm GMT Sunak adds “very soon we will be introducing new laws in parliament” regarding illegal migrants which will entail detaining them, hearing their claims in a matter of days or weeks, and having the ability in the vast majority of cases to send them to a safe country. Updated at 8.24pm GMT 8.22pm GMT On the pledge about addressing boat crossings not working, Sunak goes off on a tangent about why it needs to be fixed and it being about fairness. Morgan askes the question again, Sunak replies the UK has a new deal with France to increase patrols on beaches, a new deal with Albania to detain people and return them, and is changing the asylum system so it runs more efficiently. 8.15pm GMT Sunak tells Morgan the first 100 days were &apos;challenging&apos; When asked to assess his first 100 days, Sunak hesitates then says it was a “challenging situation” and he is proud of what he has achieved including stabilising the economy to calm the markets. Updated at 8.38pm GMT 8.13pm GMT Sunak repeats his five pledges from earlier this year that he wants to halve inflation by the end of the year, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut NHS waiting lists and address boat crossings in the English Channel. 8.11pm GMT Piers Morgan cites Tony Blair having a model fish that sang Don’t Worry Be Happy on his wall at Downing Street. On his mantra, Sunak said it is his wife. He added his message is “have hope, I can make it better”. Updated at 8.18pm GMT 8.09pm GMT On why he became PM, Sunak said he asks himself the same question on occasion. He repeats it was a sense of duty and that was how he was raised. 8.07pm GMT Sunak admitted he thought his career in frontline politics had come to an end when Liz Truss beat him in the Conservative leadership race last summer. 8.06pm GMT To mark Sunak’s 100th day in office, the prime minister told Piers Morgan on TalkTV he was having lunch with his kids at TGI Friday in Teeside when Liz Truss resigned. He said he “strongly believes in public service” and “out of a sense of duty” he should come and make a difference given it was a challenging time. 7.53pm GMT Rishi Sunak’s interview with Piers Morgan is being broadcast in about five minutes’ time, which you can follow in the live blog. Updated at 7.55pm GMT 7.45pm GMT A Home Office minister has signalled his backing for bereaved families to receive parity of funding for legal support at inquests and public inquiries. Lord Sharpe of Epsom told parliament he agreed with a Labour demand for so-called “equality of arms” in the wake of the long fight for justice by relatives of the Hillsborough disaster victims. A total of 97 football fans died as a result of a crush at a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. They were unlawfully killed amid a number of police errors, an inquest jury ruled in 2016. The government said this week it would publish “in the course of this spring” its long-awaited response to a report by the Rt Rev James Jones, former bishop of Liverpool, into the experiences of the Hillsborough families. Updated at 7.52pm GMT 7.15pm GMT Rishi Sunak has said new laws will mean people arriving in the UK without valid documents will be deported “within days”, with asylum claims rejected and migrants returned, write Jessica Elgot and Rajeev Syal. The prime minister also said he was committed to the Rwanda deportation policy, despite legal challenges, replying “yes” when asked if it would ever go ahead. In an interview to mark 100 days as prime minister, he said asylum claims would be heard in “days or weeks, not months or years”. The UK has a significant asylum backlog, with more than 140,000 people awaiting an initial decision. The Home Office is trying to double its number of asylum case workers and treble the rate at which they finish cases. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, disclosed in November that each case worker was completing a case a week on average. The government aims to have 2,500 caseworkers in place by August, compared with just under 600 in 2020. Sunak said he intended to speed up the process of assessing people alongside introducing a law saying people who arrive in the UK “illegally” – without valid documents – will not be able to claim asylum. Related: Rishi Sunak says people arriving in UK illegally will be deported ‘within days’ Updated at 7.37pm GMT 6.41pm GMT Families of Omagh bomb victims have welcomed the ordering of an independent inquiry into the atrocity. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed when a dissident republican car bomb ripped through Omagh town centre on 15 August 1998. The Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, told the Commons today he was establishing the inquiry in response to a court judgment that directed the government to carry out some form of investigation into alleged security failings. The blast, which occurred months after the signing of Northern Ireland’s historic Good Friday peace agreement, inflicted the highest death toll of any incident during the region’s conflict. In 2021, a high court judge in Belfast recommended that the UK government should carry out a human rights-compliant investigation into alleged security failures in the lead-up to the attack. Updated at 6.50pm GMT 6.18pm GMT Jo Johnson, the younger brother of the former prime minister Boris Johnson, has resigned as a director of a London-based investment bank allegedly linked to the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s crisis-ridden business empire. Lord Johnson, a former Conservative minister who was given a peerage by his brother in 2020, resigned from the board of Elara Capital on Wednesday just days after Elara was accused of using Mauritius-based funds to manipulate the share price of Adani-linked companies and obscure their ultimate ownership. Johnson, a former investment banker at Deutsche Bank and journalist for the Financial Times, joined Elara Capital in June, “in the hope of making a contribution to UK-India trade and investment ties”. On Thursday he said he had “consistently received assurances from Elara Capital that it is compliant with its legal obligations and in good standing with regulatory bodies”. “At the same time, I now recognise that this is a role that requires greater domain expertise in specialised areas of financial regulation than I anticipated and, accordingly, I have resigned from the board,” he said in an emailed statement. Related: Jo Johnson resigns as director of firm linked to Adani allegations 5.54pm GMT MSPs have voted to back the Scottish government’s tax and spending plans in a Holyrood vote. Deputy first minister John Swinney said the budget for the next year would deliver on the “priorities of a progressive government”. MSPs voted to back the Budget (Scotland) Bill by 68 votes to 56 at stage one. Under plans initially announced in December, taxes on the highest earners in Scotland will increase in response to rising inflation. Swinney set out plans to raise taxes on higher earners, with the top rate threshold reducing from £150,000 to £125,140, as well as an increase of 1p to the higher and top rates to 42p and 47p respectively. Swinney also told MSPs the Scottish government still had a £100m overspend in this year’s budget. Updated at 5.59pm GMT 5.26pm GMT Former chancellor Norman Lamont has warned against the government “making a fetish of” regulatory divergence from the EU. The long-time Eurosceptic – now known as Lord Lamont of Lerwick – emphasised that, while it was important to have the power to diverge, it should be driven by industry, not “for the sake of divergence”. The Tory peer added that divergence could be important for new technology and chastised fellow members of the European affairs committee for “clinging to the idea” of alignment with the bloc. Lamont told the House of Lords: “One of the subjects on which there was a lot of debate in our committee was that of divergence – to what extent regulation should be allowed to diverge from the previous model in the European Union? “Some members, I think, of the committee were particularly apprehensive about that and clinging to the idea that we should remain aligned in regulation. “My view is that we certainly shouldn’t make a fetish of divergence – we should not diverge for the sake of divergence. “But I think it is important to have the power – the parliamentary power – and the freedom to diverge, but these decisions should be driven by industry and commerce. “And I think divergence is very important for new technology.” His comments came as the upper chamber discussed post-Brexit trade with the EU. Updated at 5.28pm GMT 5.11pm GMT Cleverly says his Australian counterpart&apos;s comments about colonialism created &apos;no tension&apos; in talks James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has said there is “no tension” between the UK and Australia after a visiting defence minister urged Britain to confront its “uncomfortable” colonial past. Earlier this week Penny Wong, Australia’s Malaysia-born foreign minister, told an audience at King’s College London that countries such as Britain needed to tackle their colonial past if they were to establish links in the region. She said her grandmother had worked as a domestic servant for “British colonialists”, some of whom had tobacco and timber plantations. And she said: Such stories can sometimes feel uncomfortable – for those whose stories they are, and for those who hear them. But understanding the past enables us to better share the present and the future. At a joint UK-Australia press briefing in Portsmouth, Cleverly was asked about Wong’s remarks, and he said he and his counterpart had discussed colonialism during their two-day talks. It was not the mainstay of the conversations we’ve been having. The mainstay of the conversations we have been having is about our future joint work, our joint endeavours with regard to security, prosperity, technological advancement. Where we did touch upon the history, the UK’s history and our relationship with the world was in recognising you cannot eradicate or erase your history, so you have to be conscious of it. I think it is incumbent upon the UK, in our dealings with Australia or any other country with which we were once a colonial power, to recognise that we need to demonstrate that this is a modern partnership, a partnership of equals – different but equal, geographically separated but emotionally and historically bound. There has been no tension, no awkwardness. That is all from me for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is now taking over.

Photograph: WPA/Getty Images Updated at 5.29pm GMT 4.53pm GMT Parliament faces &apos;catastrophic and irreversible damage&apos; if renovation delayed too long, MPs told This morning the Commons public accounts committee took evidence from various parliamentary officials on “restoration and renewal”, the long-term project to restore the Houses of Parliament, which are increasingly dilapidated. In 2018 MPs voted to move out of the building completely at some point in the future, on the grounds that that would be the most cost-effective way of carrying out the multi-billion renovation project that everyone agrees is needed. But that plan has now been shelved and parliament is still undecided as to how to go ahead with the work. Here are the main points. If renovation is delayed too long, there will be “catastrophic and irreversible” damage to the building, MPs were told. The clerk of the Commons, Sir John Benger, said: The building is safe but it is in a condition of decay in certain key areas. If we just wait and wait, and defer and defer, eventually there will be catastrophic and irreversible damage to the palace, which is part of an Unesco world heritage site. Renovation will be so expensive it will be hard to sell to the public, Benger said. He told the committee: There is a process there of saying, look if you want this palace, this iconic building, Big Ben, the Elizabeth Tower, if you still want it to be here in 50 years’ time, this is what it is going to cost. And, spoiler alert, that cost will be a very high figure and that will be a very hard sell. Parliament is spending £2m per week on maintenance, the MPs were told. Removing asbestos from the Houses of Parliament will take two and a half years, if the building is empty, the MPs were told. The chief executive at Palace of Westminster Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority, David Goldstone, said the scale of the asbestos problem was “enormous”. He said: We think we would need something like 300 people for two and a half years to address that asbestos problem,” he told MPs. That is probably the biggest it has ever been in the UK. We’ve looked at comparators, we’ve looked at other major buildings that have been demolished with extensive asbestos and they were scales smaller. Houses of Parliament.

But TalkTV has released an extract in advance, and in it Sunak confirms that, under his plan for people arriving illegally in the UK on small boats to be removed swiftly, and denied the right to claim asylum, they will need to go through some sort of process where their claims will be heard. Sunak did not say this explicitly when he originally set out his plan in December, although it was implicit that refugees would go through some sort of process. In the interview, Sunak says he wants claims to be heard in “days or weeks”. He says: The system that we need, the system that I want to introduce, is one whereby if you come here illegally, you should be swiftly detained and then, in a matter of days or weeks, we will hear your claim, not months and years, and then we will safely remove you somewhere else. He says the new law will be introduced “very soon”. Under the system, “if you come here illegally, you’re not really going to be able to stay here”, he says. In the “vast majority of cases” people will have to leave, he says. We will be able to detain you and then we will hear your claim in a matter of days or weeks, not months or years, and we will have the ability in the vast majority of cases to send you to an alternative safe country, be that where you come from, if it’s safe, like Albania, or, indeed, Rwanda. That is the system. Sunak also says he is confident that the deportation of people seeking asylum to Rwanda – which has not happened yet because the policy is being challenged in court – will happen. Updated at 4.33pm GMT 3.49pm GMT Rapist Isla Bryson &apos;almost certainly&apos; not truly transgender, Sturgeon tells MSPs Accusations that Isla Bryson is not truly transgender are “almost certainly the case”, Nicola Sturgeon has said. As PA Media reports, at first minister’s questions in Holyrood today Sturgeon was pressed on whether she thinks Bryson – who was convicted of raping two women while she was a man called Adam Graham – is a woman. Bryson was initially taken to Cornton Vale prison near Stirling – Scotland’s only all-female jail – after being convicted, before being moved to the male estate following a public outcry. After Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, asked her if Bryson should be considered a woman, Sturgeon said she did not know if Bryson was lying about her gender. She said: This individual claims to be a woman – what I said was that I don’t have information about whether those claims have validity or not. But I don’t think Douglas Ross and I are disagreeing here, because what I think is relevant in this case is not whether the individual is a man or claims to be a woman or is trans, what is relevant is that the individual is a rapist. That is how the individual should be described, and it is that that should be the main consideration in deciding how the individual is dealt with – that is why the individual is in a male prison, not in the female prison, these are the issues that matter. Ross read a quote from one of Bryson’s victims, who said: “I don’t believe he’s truly transgender. I feel as if he’s made a mockery out of them using it. As far as I’m concerned, that was to make things easier for himself.” In response, Sturgeon said: The quote that Douglas Ross narrated there, my feeling is that is almost certainly the case, which is why the key factor in this case is not the individual’s claim to be a woman, the key and only important factor in this is that the individual is convicted of rape – the individual is a rapist – and that is the factor that should be the deciding one about the decisions about how that prisoner is now treated. Sturgeon said it was important to consider the issues raised by the Bryson case, but she added two caveats. Firstly, as I’ve said, that we do not further stigmatise trans people generally – I think that is important – but secondly that we don’t cause undue concern amongst the public.

Photograph: Ken Jack/Getty Images Updated at 4.30pm GMT 3.17pm GMT Brexit damaging UK growth more quickly than expected, says Bank of England Brexit is damaging UK growth more quickly than expected, the deputy governor of the Bank of England said today. At a news conference to explain today’s interest rate decision, Ben Broadbent said it was still not clear whether the effects of EU withdrawal were a reason why the UK is forecast to do worse than other major economies this year. He said the Bank has not changed its overall assessment about Brexit having a negative effect on growth. But he said it had not expected to see the impact come through so quickly. He explained: Brexit … has been something that has pulled on our potential output in our country and that’s been our assessment for many years. We’ve not changed our estimate of the long-running effects, but we’ve brought some of them forward and we think they’re probably coming in faster than we first expected …. Yes, it [Brexit] is having some effect on growth, although ultimately no bigger effect than we assessed some years ago. Based on the numbers for trade and, to some degree, for the numbers on investment, we think these effects are coming through faster than initially envisaged. Overall, as PA Media reports, the Bank said that while it believed the UK was still heading for a recession, the downturn may be shorter and shallower than previously expected. In its monetary policy report today the Bank says: The effects of Brexit on trade are now estimated to be emerging more quickly than previously assumed, and that lowers productivity somewhat. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank, said at the press conference that Brexit was one of a series of “significant economic shocks” to have affected the economy, along with Covid and the war in Ukraine. He went on: These shocks have held back both productivity and labour supply. Updated at 4.05pm GMT 2.53pm GMT Here is a Guardian video of Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, announcing the inquiry into the Omagh bombing in the Commons earlier. 2.49pm GMT NIO sets out four issues to be covered by new inquiry into Omagh bombing The Northern Ireland Office has published further details of the statutory inquiry it is setting up into the Omagh bombing. The inquiry is going ahead in response to a court judgment ruling that, under the European convention on human rights, some form of investigation was needed. The legal case was brought by Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden died in the bombing. The NIO said in a news release: The Real IRA claimed responsibility for the Omagh bombing in 1998, and four members of the Real IRA were subsequently found liable for the bombing in civil proceedings held in Northern Ireland. This inquiry does nothing to counter these findings, which are clear in who was responsible for this awful atrocity. The independent statutory inquiry will examine the four issues identified by the high court; the handling and sharing of intelligence, the use of cell phone analysis, whether there was advance knowledge or reasonable means of knowledge of the bomb, and whether disruption operations could or should have been mounted, which may have helped prevent the Real IRA’s attack.

Photograph: James Manning/PA 2.17pm GMT No 10 dismisses Boris Johnson&apos;s claim Ukrainian pilots could quickly learn to fly western fighter jets Yesterday Boris Johnson, the former PM, implicitly criticised the UK government for not supplying Ukraine with military jets. No 10 has argued it would take too long to train the pilots, but Johnson told the Atlantic Council thinktank: I hear that an objection to their having sophisticated western planes to fly is that they wouldn’t know how to use them. I have to say, I take that argument with a bit of a pinch of salt. I don’t think it’ll take the Ukrainians very long to work out how to use F-16s or Typhoons or whatever we have to give them. Asked about Johnson’s comments, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the lobby briefing that the fastest training programme for a jet pilot took around three years, and that five years was normal. He said: We will continue listening to the Ukrainians and consider what is right for the long term. But it’s helpful to understand the situation, that the fastest training programme for a new pilot is approximately 35 months. The current UK fast jet training programme takes five years. Updated at 2.49pm GMT 2.08pm GMT Downing Street refuses to comment on claims Raab officials had mental health crises Downing Street refused to comment on Dave Penman’s claim that some officials who worked for Dominic Raab suffered mental health crises. (See 10.01am.) Asked about what the FDA general secretary said, the PM’s spokesperson said: The prime minister felt that once formal complaints were raised, it was right to have an independent person, a respected KC, to look into it. That’s what’s happening now. I’m not going to comment on the reports, seeing as that process is taking place. Updated at 2.10pm GMT 2.05pm GMT No 10 says revelations about British Gas forcing vulunerable customers on to prepayment meters &apos;deeply shocking&apos; At the lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said the Times revelations about British Gas forcing customers to have prepayment meters (see 9.17am) were “deeply shocking and concerning”. He went on: Vulnerable families should not be treated so poorly. The findings suggest British Gas has failed to use every possible avenue to support those struggling with their energy bills, as they rightly deserve and are entitled to. Graham Stuart, the energy minister, is due to meet executives from British Gas to discuss the situation this afternoon. It is understood that Stuart called the Ofgem chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, early this morning to discuss the revelations. Sources at the business department said Stuart demanded Ofgem explain their role in this and ensure they take urgent remedial action. They said ministers were particularly keen to ensure the regulator asked “more searching questions” of the energy companies during their future investigations. Updated at 2.49pm GMT 1.57pm GMT No 10 defends current level of windfall tax after Labour says it should be higher At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesperson defended the current scope of the windfall tax on energy companies. Labour says the profits declared by Shell today show why it should be higher, or more extensive. (See 9.17am.) Asked about this issue, the PM’s spokesperson said: We recognise that the public will think these are extraordinary profits, clearly. That’s why once it was clear that there would be a windfall because of various factors including the war in Ukraine, we put in place the energy profits levy. The new headline 75% tax rate is comparable with other North Sea tax regimes including Norway, and we think that strikes a balance between funding cost of living support while encouraging investment in order to bolster the UK energy security. The spokesperson also said there were no plans to increase the windfall tax. Updated at 2.51pm GMT 1.24pm GMT Labour says plan to reform social care system for children does not amount to &apos;radical reset&apos; needed The Department for Education has today unveiled plans to reform the social care system for children in England. My colleague Patrick Butler wrote a preview of the plans here. Related: Children to be housed closer to family in overhaul of England’s social care system Here is the DfE’s news release. And here is the ‘Stable homes, built on love’ strategy and consultation document. Responding to a Commons statement about the plan, Helen Hayes, the shadow children’s minister, said this did not amount to the “radical reset” that was needed. She said: While some additional funding is welcome, this is not the radical reset the review demanded and which we need. There is no vision for the direction of children’s social care, there is no ambition for our most vulnerable children, there is no cross-cutting commitment from the top of government to deliver better for every child and every care-experienced person in every part of our country. This government has spent months legislating to restrict the fundamental rights to protest and to strike but has chosen not to make time to legislate to strengthen protections for children. In response, Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, said the plans were the “start of the journey” and the government needed to consider what worked and what didn’t. Updated at 1.31pm GMT 1.07pm GMT Northern Ireland secretary announces statutory inquiry into Omagh bombing Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, has told MPs in a statement that the government will establish an independent statutory inquiry into the Omagh bombing in 1998, which killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins. 12.45pm GMT Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, says that a year ago today, when the government published its levelling up white paper, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, promised an annual report setting out the progress made towards the goals set out in the document. She has written to Gove asking why we haven’t had it yet, saying this is “the latest in a long line of broken promises on levelling up”.

In a statement she says: With households already paying a Tory mortgage penalty, families across the country will be worried about what rising interest rates today mean for them. The reality is that under the Tories, growth is on the floor, families are worse off and we are stuck in the global slow lane. We do not have to continue on this path of managed decline when Britain has so much potential to grow and thrive. 12.18pm GMT Hunt welcomes Bank&apos;s decision to raise interest rates to 4%, saying it will help government to halve inflation Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has issued a statement backing the Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. He said this would help the government achieve its aim of halving inflation this year. He said: Inflation is a stealth tax that is the biggest threat to living standards in a generation, so we support the Bank’s action today so we succeed in halving inflation this year. We will play our part by making sure government decisions are in lockstep with the Bank’s approach, including by resisting the urge right now to fund additional spending or tax cuts through borrowing, which will only add fuel to the inflation fire and prolong the pain for everyone.

(See 11.41pm.) The Times reports: Seven in ten (72 per cent) believe he will not be prime minister after the next election, while just 27 per cent think he has done well so far. However, the YouGov polling also found that by a margin of 14 points voters think Sunak has been a better prime minister than Johnson. Here is the Times graphic showing whether voters think Sunak is doing well or badly on five key issues. Polling on Sunak’s performance Photograph: The Times Almost two thirds of people think Sunak is a better prime minister than Liz Truss, the poll suggests. But only a third believe that he is better than Boris Johnson. (By the time he left office, Johnson was mired in scandal, and his ratings were dire, and if a majority of people think Sunak is no better, then he is in real trouble. But perhaps people responding to this question are thinking of the Johnson premiership in its totality, and giving him credit for things like the vaccine programme.) Polling on prime ministers Photograph: The Times Updated at 12.13pm GMT 11.41am GMT On the subject of Rishi Sunak reaching his 100th day in office, my colleague Jessica Elgot has a great assessment of how it’s going. Here is an extract. After Liz Truss left office, polls suggested that voters wanted to keep an open mind about Sunak and rated him significantly higher than his party. That is now beginning to turn. According to senior Labour figures, their most recent focus groups, with swing voters in Southampton, Dewsbury and Bury last week, were described as being “utterly brutal for Sunak”, with participants engaging in “open mockery” of the prime minister. Even the most pessimistic members of Keir Starmer’s team say they have seen a decisive shift. Voters were scathing about attempts to tackle the cost of living and suggested they believed fundamental public services like the NHS were broken. From the focus groups, there was a growing feeling many had not seen much of Sunak since coming to power – though Sunak is trying to shift this narrative with a series of “PM Connect” events across the country, spending well over his allotted time speaking directly to local voters. But the most common refrain from voters was the one that Tory MPs are also the most nervous about – that Sunak is “out of touch” and that his wealth means he cannot understand voters’ concerns. One voter in Bury told Labour’s researchers that they could not take Sunak seriously when he spoke about the NHS, because it was obvious he had never been on a waiting list. You can read the full article here. Related: Ratings sink and obstacles amass as Sunak completes first 100 days as PM 11.33am GMT Sunak says what he calls &apos;stop the boats&apos; bill will be published in coming weeks To mark the fact he has now reached 100 days in office, Rishi Sunak has written an article for the Sun about his priorities. It is largely about his five promises, and Sunak says the legislation he has promised to stop people claiming asylum in the UK if they have arrived in the country illegally will be published “in the coming weeks”. He describes it as the “stop the boats” bill (which will almost certainly not be its official name – the Commons clerks insist on bills having neutral titles). Sunak says: In the coming weeks, our new stop the boats bill will change the law to send a message loud and clear. If you come here illegally, you will be detained and removed. In December Sunak said the bill would be published “early” in the new year, but this article implies it is not imminent. There is some evidence that ministers are still divided over how far it should go in allowing the UK to ignore the obligations it has to asylum seekers under exisiting international law. Updated at 12.00pm GMT 10.59am GMT About 70% of teachers did not participate in the strike that took place yesterday, Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, told MPs. During Cabinet Office questions he said: I am deeply saddened by any interruption to the education of our children, particularly when they have suffered so much during Covid. I would, though, like to pay tribute to headteachers and others who ensured that around 90% of schools were open in one capacity or another to ensure that we continued to have education for our children, and indeed the teachers, 70% of whom did not participate in the strike. Dowden also said that only 12% of civil servants participated in the civil servants’ strike.

Related: Energy regulator launches British Gas investigation over prepayment meters 10.38am GMT NHS England figures show small improvement in ambulance handover delays NHS England has published some new performance figures this morning. They show some evidence that pressures on hospitals are easing very slightly. PA Media has the details Ambulance handover delays outside hospitals in England are continuing to improve and have fallen to a new low for this winter, PA says. It reports: A total of 18% of ambulance patients waited at least 30 minutes last week to be handed to A&amp;E teams, down from 20% the previous week. The figure hit a record 44% in the week to 1 January. about 6% of patients waited more than an hour last week to be handed over to A&amp;E teams – again, the lowest so far this winter, and down week on week from 7%. Nearly 14,000 hospital beds in England last week were filled with people who were fit to leave, close to recent record levels, PA says. It reports: An average of 13,983 beds were taken up with medically fit patients in the seven days to 29 January, up from 13,566 the previous week and just short of the all-time high of 14,069 in the week to 8 January. At this point last year the number stood at 12,257. The proportion of patients ready to leave hospital last week but who remained in their beds stood at 59%. This is down from a record 63% in the week to 1 January. The number of flu patients in hospitals in England has dropped for the fourth week in a row, PA says. It reports: An average of 1,291 patients with flu were in hospital beds each day last week, down 37% from 2,034 in the week to 22 January, according to NHS England data. It is the fourth week in a row the number of flu patients in hospital has dropped, down 76% from a peak of 5,441 in the week to 1 January. Updated at 11.36am GMT 10.01am GMT Working for Raab led some officials to have mental health crises, says leader of civil servants&apos; union As the headline on our overnight story about Dominic Raab puts it rather well, the justice secretary and deputy prime ministers remains “in peril” because of the inquiry into allegations he bullied officials. Related: Dominic Raab in peril as No 10 refuses to say if Sunak knew of complaints In the papers today there is evidence that Raab, or his allies, are fighting back. In a story in the Daily Mail Jason Grove says that at least two senior officials giving evidence to the bullying inquiry have spoken in defence of Raab. And Grove reports: A former colleague said: ‘There is a clear attempt by a group of politically motivated mandarins to get him – it looks like a coordinated attempt by a number of senior civil servants. ‘In one case it looks like revenge as the individual was effectively forced out by the government.’ Several of Mr Raab’s former staff yesterday said they had not witnessed unreasonable conduct. One said he was ‘demanding, sometimes difficult and a bit curt – but not a bully’. And Matt Dathan and Chris Smyth in the Times report that “Raab has declared he has never sworn or shouted in a meeting after it was claimed he roared ‘bullshit’ in response to a senior official’s briefing he disagreed with”. They quote a spokeperson for Raab saying: The deputy prime minister has never sworn or shouted in a meeting. He sets targets across the department to focus relentlessly on delivery in the way that the British people would expect. In response to the Daily Mail report, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the union representing senior civil servants, rejected claims that the complaints against Raab were politically motivated. He told Sky News: That’s extraordinary and it couldn’t be further from the truth. Are we really seeing two dozen civil servants in three different government departments over a period of four years have got together in some massive conspiracy? That just doesn’t sound credible. Penman said he knew that some people who worked for Raab had suffered mental health crises. He said: I’ve spoken to people who are civil servants working, and have worked, for Dominic Raab, who have suffered mental health crises, have lost their careers essentially because they’ve had to move and change jobs. Referring to Jacob Rees-Mogg’s claim that people should not be too “snowflakey” about these allegations, Penman said: This sort of behaviour destroys lives. I mean it’s not just about careers, people’s lives and their mental health are at risk when they are subject to systematic bullying, and to belittle it in that way is absolutely outrageous from a former leader of the house and cabinet minister. Penman also repeated his call for Raab to be suspended until the inquiry concludes, and he said Rishi Sunak should “come clean” and reveal whether he was informally warned about Raab’s conduct before he appointed him to his cabinet. Raab has repeatedly denied bullying staff and insisted that he “behaved professionally at all times”. &quot;The Prime Minister needs to come clean&quot; Gen Sec of the FDA Dave Penman says there are reports that the PM was briefed on bullying allegations however Rishi Sunak &quot;refuses to say whether he was told there were informal complaints about Dominic Raab&quot;https://t.co/WUnquWvHqf pic.twitter.com/BbSNHoBgTN — Sky News (@SkyNews) February 2, 2023 Updated at 10.10am GMT 9.32am GMT Britain has missed out on £400bn of growth since 2010, says TUC The failure of successive Conservative governments to recognise the negative impact of public spending cuts on the wider economy has meant Britain missed out on £400bn of growth since 2010, according to a report by the TUC. My colleague Phillip Inman has the story here. Related: Britain has missed out on £400bn of growth since 2010, says TUC 9.30am GMT And this is what Ofgem, the energy regulator, has said about the Times story. (See 9.17am.) These are extremely serious allegations from the Times which we will investigate urgently with British Gas and we won’t hesitate to take firm enforcement action. It is unacceptable for any supplier to impose forced installations on vulnerable customers struggling to pay their bills before all other options have been exhausted and without carrying out thorough checks to ensure it is safe and practicable to do so. We recently announced a major market-wide review investigating the rapid growth in prepayment meter installations and potential breaches of licences driving it. We are clear that suppliers must work hard to look after their customers at this time, especially those who are vulnerable, and the energy crisis must not be an excuse for unacceptable behaviour towards any customer – particularly those in vulnerable circumstances. Updated at 9.34am GMT 9.28am GMT Centrica says it is suspending forcing customers on to prepayment meters following Times revelations Here is a statement from Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of Centrica, which owns British Gas, on the Times report about a contractor working for the company forcing vulnerable customers to move to prepayment meters, including by breaking in to homes to execute a court warrant (See 9.17am.) The allegations around our third-party contractor Arvato are unacceptable and we immediately suspended their warrant activity. Having recently reviewed our internal processes to support our prepayment customers, as well as creating a new £10m fund to support those prepayment customers who need help the most, I am extremely disappointed that this has occurred. As a result, on Wednesday morning, we took a further decision to suspend all our prepayment warrant activity at least until the end of the winter. More broadly, there are clearly significant challenges around affordability and unfortunately, we don’t see that changing any time soon. We need to strike a balance between managing spiralling bad debt and being aware that there are those who refuse to pay and those who cannot pay. We think government, industry and the regulator need to come together to agree a long-term plan to address this and ultimately create an energy market that is sustainable. Updated at 9.37am GMT 9.17am GMT Labour renews call for ‘proper’ windfall tax as Shell declares record £32.2bn profit Good morning. There are two big stories involving energy companies out this morning. Both of them have important political ramifications, and Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, has been speaking out forcefully on both issues. As for the government – it has been rather quieter. First, Shell has announced its profits for the final quarter of 2022, $9.81bn, taking its profits for the whole year to almost $40bn (£32.2bn). My colleague Alex Lawson has the story here. Related: Shell makes record $40bn in profits on back of surging gas prices In response, Miliband said this showed why the windfall tax on energy companies should be increased. He said: As the British people face an energy price hike of 40% in April, the government is letting the fossil fuel companies making bumper profits off the hook with their refusal to implement a proper windfall tax. Labour would stop the energy price cap going up in April, because it is only right that the companies making unexpected windfall profits from the proceeds of war pay their fair share. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, announced an extension to the windfall tax in the autumn statement, but as my colleage Nils Pratley argued at the time, it could have gone a lot further. And the BBC has a good account of some of the loopholes in it here. Second, the Times has this morning splashed on the findings of a powerful investigation revealing that “British Gas routinely sends debt collectors to break into customers’ homes and force-fit pay-as-you-go meters, even when they are known to have extreme vulnerabilities”. It says: An undercover reporter worked for Arvato, a company used by British Gas to pursue debts, amid rocketing energy prices and more customers falling behind with their bills. The reporter accompanied debt agents in below-freezing conditions as they worked with a locksmith to break into the home of a single father of three young children and switch it to a prepayment meter. If families with these gas meters cannot afford to top up, their heating is cut off. On another occasion agents were sent by British Gas with a court warrant to force-fit a meter at the home of a young mother with a four-week-old baby. Her bills have risen sevenfold during the cost of living crisis. According to job notes seen by The Times, other British Gas customers who have had prepayment meters fitted by force in recent weeks include a woman in her fifties described as “severe mental health bipolar”, a woman who “suffers with mobility problems and is partially sighted” and a mother whose “daughter is disabled and has a hoist and [an] electric wheelchair”. Thursday&apos;s Times: British Gas breaking into homes of the vulnerable #TomorrowsPapersToday #TheTimes #Times pic.twitter.com/dTT3cEI1aH — Tomorrows Papers Today (@TmorrowsPapers) February 1, 2023 On the Today programme this morning Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of Centrica, British Gas’s parent company, said he was appalled by the paper’s revelations. “There is nothing that I can say that can express the horror I had when I heard this. It is completely unacceptable,” he said. O’Shea said the contractor used by British Gas had let them down, and he said the forced introduction of prepayment meters had been suspended, at least until the end of the winter. Labour has been calling for a moratorium on customers being forced on to pre-payment meters and this morning Miliband – who tabled an urgent question on this topic only last week – told the Today programme this morning it was “shameful” that this was happening. He said: It’s shameful that we are in Britain in 2023 and this is happening. That is why for weeks now we have been calling for a moratorium, a ban, on the forced installation of prepayment meters, not just to British Gas, but right across the board, because this is a system that stinks and is in disrepute. There’s no proper definition of vulnerability. There’s no proper checks on when these prepayment meters are being forced into people’s homes. There’s no proper system for when this so-called last resort happens. This is a system that is in desperate need of reform. People are being put through appalling hardship and appalling circumstances and the government must act, as I have been urging for weeks now, to stop this practice happening right across the board. Last month Grant Shapps, the business secretary, said he was asking energy companies to voluntarily stop forcing customers to use prepayment meters. He told the Times he was “horrified” by its revelations. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs about whether there will be a public inquiry into the Omagh bombing. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: The Welsh government holds a briefing ahead of the strikes planned for 7 February. 12pm: The Bank of England announces its decision on interest rates. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering this on his business live blog. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon takes first minister’s questions in the Scottish parliament. Afternoon: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, and Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, hold a press conference after talks with their Australian counterparts. I’ll try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow.

    <body>Like many of Queensland’s sex workers, Delaney* doesn’t trust the police. It was an unsettling encounter with an undercover officer that caused her distrust and fear of the authorities. “A [client] turned up, asked some really odd questions and then left,” Delaney says. “It was frightening. I was in my work clothes and all dressed up.” Delaney says she soon realised it was a setup and the awkward client was actually a police officer. Now, after 20 years in the business, if something goes wrong at work she’ll think twice before making a report. “It’s a practice that nobody should be subjected to,” Delaney says. “That a person’s trying to trick you into borderline or possibly illegal sexual behaviour to charge you – it’s perverse.” Related: Queensland to decriminalise sex work as review recommends new advertising rules Elle Coles, a trans sex worker says there would hardly be a sex worker in Queensland who hadn’t spoken to an officer over the phone at some point in their career. “It’s a victimless crime,” Coles says. “Why anyone would be proactive about prosecuting a person defies humanity.” In a major shake-up, the Queensland government this week committed to decriminalising sex work and bringing the industry “out of the shadows”. The government says it is “broadly supportive” of recommendations by the Queensland Law Reform Commission, which includes repealing laws that allow police to pose as clients and entrap workers. Respect Inc and DecrimQLD’s campaign manager, Janelle Fawkes, is calling for a moratorium on these police powers while sex workers await legislative changes. “As sex workers, we don’t trust the police and that’s not only because they appear to … charge us for really minor offences,” Fawkes says. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “But it’s also because … there are hundreds of stories of sex workers being treated really badly.” Queensland’s police minister, Mark Ryan, says: “Like all Queenslanders, I expect all members of the Queensland Police Service to act in accordance with the law.” A Queensland police spokesperson says the “QPS is obligated to investigate offences against Queensland legislation [and] this includes illegal prostitution”. They said it was “not appropriate to release specific details of methodologies and ongoing police investigations”. Sex work is currently under a licensing framework in Queensland, with the majority of workers considered “unlawful” or unlicensed. Decriminalisation would change sex workers’ lives in many small but significant ways. Private workers will be able to share accommodation with other sex workers, employ a receptionist and text other workers before or after a booking to check they’re safe. They will also be able to advertise what services they offer – a big win for trans and gender-diverse workers – and work at the same hotel as another sex worker without being charged. Hope, an Aboriginal sex worker says she’s felt unsafe a few times at work but has been unable to message a friend under the current laws. “I’ve had times where a client has wanted to keep me for longer or where things started to feel unsafe … if they got violent, nobody would’ve known where I was,” she says. Hope says current work options in Queensland are limited, with only 20 brothels operating across the state. Related: ‘Forced to move home’: discrimination of Queensland sex workers needs to end, say advocates “You will raise … safety concerns or OH&amp;S issues … and then you’re been labelled as the troublemaker and they basically say, ‘there’s no shift for you this week’,” Hope says. “If you’re somebody that speaks out in a couple of those, you end up not being welcome in any of them.” There are other issues, like exemptions to the state’s anti-discrimination act that allow sex workers to be discriminated against when working in other jobs whcich involve children, or in securing accommodation. The state government is expected to introduce legislation to address these issues before the next election. “That kind of vilification has a major impact on people’s sense of self, safety and housing stability,” Fawkes says. But despite the decades of stigma and vilification, sex workers are feeling optimistic about the changes to come. “Decriminalisation will mean being able to run our businesses, look after our clientele, working as professionals without any stigmatising labels,” Coles said. “Sex workers aren’t going to hold grudges … we look forward to a brighter future.” *Names have been changed</body>

    <head>God’s Petting You review – drug addict meets sex addict in shallow crime caper</head>
    <body>This mostly unamusing British comedy sets off with a framing device that sees heroin addict Charlie (George Webster) explaining recent events in his life to a rapt therapist (Alice Lowe). Clever-clogs viewers might assume that this is the setup for some unreliable-narrator shenanigans and a twist or two at the end, and you’d be right. But the twist – more of an ugly snarl – is unearned by the setup, and feels like the product of lazy screenwriting, devoid of psychological insight. That sort of fits the cheerful, jejune amorality of this film, which treats addiction as if it’s all a bit of a lark and that the therapeutic community – like the woman who runs Charlie’s self-help group – is way too judgmental, man. Charlie, you see, is one of the movie heroin addicts: lovely dewy skin and nice hair, just a bit of a rebel and a clown. He only attends group therapy so he can meet his dealer (Joe Wilkinson), who is disloyally moving to Winchester – a change of situation that Charlie sees only in terms of how inconvenient that will be for him. (At least that’s credible junkie behaviour.) Then, one week, in walks a beautiful woman with a fancy insect tattoo on her chest (Skye Lourie) who never gets a name in the film. It turns out this is an all-purpose addiction meeting because “tattoo girl” (as she’s called in the end credits) is a sex addict, and soon enough she and Charlie are knocking boots. Although a monologue establishes that she only became a sex addict because she was abused by a psychiatrist as a child, the film (again) seems to think this sort addiction is mostly just hedonistic fun, and which makes Tattoo Girl and Charlie perfect for each other. The only problem is that Tattoo Girl has an abusive if phenomenally well-endowed porn-star boyfriend (Benedict Garrett), so our young lovers hatch a plan to rip him off, which involves buying a gun from a shady dealer known as the American (Patrick Bergin). As the story goes on, the protagonists become even more feckless, selfish and dislikable, although writer-director Jamie Patterson seems intent on showing them as two wisecracking, crazy mixed-up kids the audience is meant to root for. It’s a bit repugnant, but even so one has to give props to some of the supporting players here. Wilkinson delivers a droll, filthy monologue and Joss Porter is genuinely funny as Charlie’s coked-up call-centre colleague with marital problems. • God’s Petting You is previewing the Duke of York’s, Brighton on 15 April, and Genesis, London on 17 April, and is released on 21 April in UK cinemas.</body>

    <head>House passes landmark legislation protecting same-sex marriage</head>
    <body>The House gave final passage on Thursday to landmark legislation protecting same-sex marriage, in a bipartisan vote that reflects a remarkable shift in public opinion just over a quarter-century after Congress defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The final vote was 258 to 169, with 39 Republican members joining every House Democrat in supporting the bill. One Republican, Burgess Owens of Utah, voted present. Related: Virginia restaurant cancels reservation of anti-LGBTQ+ organization The vote was one of the final acts of this lame-duck Congress before the balance of power shifts and Republicans take control of the House in January. The bill, which provides a degree of relief for hundreds of thousands of same-sex married couples in the US, next goes to Joe Biden, who has said he will sign the legislation “promptly and proudly”. “Today, Congress took a critical step to ensure that Americans have the right to marry the person they love,” Biden said. “The House’s bipartisan passage of the Respect for Marriage Act – by a significant margin – will give peace of mind to millions of LGBTQI+ and interracial couples who are now guaranteed the rights and protections to which they and their children are entitled.” The historic legislation, known as the Respect for Marriage Act, requires federal and state governments to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages, prohibiting them from denying the validity of a marriage legally performed in another state on the basis of sex, race or ethnicity. During an emotional bill enrollment ceremony on Thursday, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, wiped tears from her eyes as she thanked the many lawmakers and advocates who made the legislation a reality. “At last we have history in the making,” Pelosi said. “Not only are we on the right side of history, we’re on the right side of the future: expanding freedom in America.” Momentum for the bill began to build after the supreme court’s ruling overturning Roe v Wade in June raised fears that the conservative-leaning court might reverse same-sex marriage next. Writing in support of the majority’s decision, the conservative supreme court justice Clarence Thomas had suggested the court might also consider striking down “demonstrably erroneous” precedents set by rulings like Obergefell v Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide and ended bans in the states that had them. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person elected to the Senate, said the newly passed bill would provide reassurance to all LGBTQ+ citizens living in fear of having their marriages invalidated. “Today we are making history, but we’re also making a difference for millions of Americans,” said Baldwin, who played a key role in crafting the bill. “With the passage of the Respect for Marriage Act, we can put to rest the worries of millions of loving couples who are concerned that some day an activist supreme court may take their rights and freedoms away.” Despite support from some Republican lawmakers, most still opposed the legislation, calling it unnecessary. During the House debate over the bill, a number of Republicans criticized the proposal as an insult to religious liberty and a Democratic attempt to force liberal policies on more conservative states. However, should Obergefell fall, the new law would not compel all 50 states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples nor does it stop states from moving to ban or limit same-sex marriages. In a concession to win Republican support, the measure also includes an exemption for religious organizations, guaranteeing that they would not be required to provide goods, services or accommodations for a celebration of a same-sex marriage, and that such a refusal would not jeopardize their tax-exempt status or other benefits. Notably, the bill would also repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma), which defined a marriage as the union between a man and a woman and denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. Though the supreme court struck down part of the law, it remained on the books. When Bill Clinton signed Doma into law in 1996, same-sex marriage was considered a divisive cultural issue. At the time, nearly seven in 10 Americans said marriages between same-sex couples should not be recognized by law as valid, according to Gallup. Now, decades later, almost exactly the same number of Americans – a record 71% – say same-sex unions should be legal. The former Democratic congressman Barney Frank, the first House member to voluntarily come out as gay, celebrated Doma’s demise at the bill enrollment ceremony on Thursday, where his arrival was greeted with applause. “I was here for the birth of Doma, so I am very grateful to be able to be here for the funeral,” Frank said. LGBTQ advocates, meanwhile, praised the legislation as a “clear victory for this country’s 568,000 same-sex married couples”. But they argued that there is still more to do to protect marriage equality and LGBTQ+ Americans, who continue to face threats and violence, including a deadly shooting at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs last month. “Today’s vote in the House of Representatives sends a clear message: love is winning,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “We eagerly await the president’s signature on this important legislation – and look forward to continuing to fight for full equality for everyone in our community, without exception.” While there was little question the bill would pass the Democratic-controlled House, proponents say its passage was not inevitable. Earlier this summer, House Democrats held what many expected would amount to a “show” vote demonstrating their commitment to protecting same-sex marriage while drawing a contrast with Republicans, whose midterm message targeted LGBTQ+ Americans. But 47 House Republican lawmakers unexpectedly voted for the measure, a bipartisan tally that suddenly gave advocates hope that the upper chamber could muster enough bipartisan support to overcome the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold. After months of negotiating, the Senate voted 61-36 to approve a version of the measure, sponsored by Baldwin. It drew the support of 12 Republican senators. “On the Senate side, I think we can say we defied political gravity,” Baldwin said on Thursday. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, heralded the legislation as a “very important step forward” in the nation’s “long but inexorable march towards greater equality”. Like many Americans, the issue of marriage equality is personal for Schumer. His daughter and her wife are expecting their first child next year. “Today, thanks to the tireless advocacy of many, many in this room and the dogged work by many of my colleagues, my grandchild will live in a world that will respect and honor their mothers’ marriage,” Schumer said at the enrollment ceremony. For Pelosi, who announced last month that she would step down from House leadership, the bill’s passage was not just a national achievement but also a personal milestone. When Pelosi joined the House in 1987, her first remarks on the floor were about fighting HIV/Aids. Now, after 35 years in office and two stints as speaker, one of the final bills she will send to the president will protect the rights of LGBTQ+ couples. Just before voting for the bill, Pelosi said: “Today, we stand up for the values the vast majority of Americans hold dear – a belief in the dignity, beauty and divinity – divinity, a spark of divinity in every person – an abiding respect for love so powerful that it binds two people together.”</body>

    <head>‘It’s like we don’t exist’: Japan faces pressure to allow same-sex marriage</head>
    <body>Akane Kousaka and her partner live in fear of the day when one of them falls ill or is injured in an accident. The LGBTQ+ couple have a “partnership certificate” issued by their ward office in Tokyo, but it comes with none of the legal guarantees afforded married heterosexual couples – including the right to visit a spouse in hospital. “We might be able to get special permission, but we shouldn’t have to rely on other people’s goodwill … it’s not right,” Kousaka told the Observer. Other countries were leaving Japan behind, she added. Pressure is building on Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to recognise LGBTQ+ rights as the country prepares to host the G7 summit in May. It is the only country in the G7 that denies same-sex couples the right to marry. Kishida has attempted to deflect criticism that his conservative Liberal Democratic party is trapped in a cycle of intolerance as the summit approaches, yet few believe that Japan’s moment in the international spotlight will take the country closer to allowing equal marriage. He recently created a new government post responsible for LGBTQ+ rights and met equality campaigners. But he also provoked anger by claiming that Japan’s ban on same-sex marriage was “not discriminatory”, and that legalising it would “fundamentally change society” and challenge so-called traditional family values. In response, Takako Uesugi, co-leader of a group of lawyers representing plaintiffs in Tokyo court cases seeking marriage equality, said Kishida’s ambiguity on sexual minority rights was tantamount to “approving of discrimination”. Makiko Terahara, an equal marriage campaigner, speaks at a press conference in Tokyo in February. Photograph: Yoshio Tsunoda/AFLO/REX/Shutterstock Activists are ramping up the pressure as the clock ticks down to the G7 leaders’ summit in Hiroshima. At a Pride 7 summit in Tokyo last week, campaigners called on Japan to enact an anti-discrimination law before it hosts the G7, and end the country’s unenviable status as the only member of the group that does not have a law protecting LGBTQ+ rights. “The legislation is not only a minimum requirement for [LGBTQ+] people to be able to be who they are, but also a symbolic step toward eliminating underlying discrimination and prejudice against them,” Makiko Terahara, of the equal rights group Marriage for All Japan, said at the summit, which was also attended by officials from G7 countries and the European Union. Natsuo Hayashi, co-director of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation, said at the campaign’s launch: “Other G7 members are watching if Japan enacts an anti-discrimination law.” The government is also coming under external pressure, with the US ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, calling for “clear, unambiguous” legislation to protect sexual minorities before the current parliamentary session ends in June. In a letter to Kishida, ambassadors from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, the US and the EU called on Japan to “match its international advocacy for human rights with a domestic agenda that includes steps to protect its own LGBTQI+ communities”. Yet Kishida faces an uphill battle convincing influential members of his own party, some of whom have made overtly homophobic remarks. Mio Sugita, a rightwing member of the lower house, said in a magazine article in 2018 that members of the LGBTQ+ community were “unproductive” because they cannot have children. Sugita did not retract or apologise for the remarks until late last year. In 2022, 15 years after Kanako Otsuji became Japan’s first openly gay politician, a pamphlet distributed at a meeting of LDP MPs described homosexuality as an “acquired psychological disorder” – a view shared by religious and other groups that have traditionally backed the party. In February, Masayoshi Arai, a senior aide to Kishida, was sacked after saying that he “would not want to live next door” to an LGBTQ+ couple and did “not even want to look at them”. Soshi Matsuoka, who heads a sexual minority support group, said Arai’s remarks showed Japan was unfit to host the G7 summit. “As the only G7 country where legal measures for sexual minorities have not progressed, the country will face even more severe scrutiny from the international community,” Matsuoka told the Kyodo news agency. Japan’s prime minister Fumio Kishida faces a battle to persuade members of his own party of the need for equality. Photograph: Reuters Kishida is hoping that planned legislation that promotes “understanding” of LGBTQ+ people – but which stops well short of legalising equal marriage – will take the sting out of criticism that he has caved in to conservatives in his own party who are increasingly out of step with the public. In a recent poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, 72% of voters said they believed gay marriage should be legalised, with only 18% opposed. “I think it’s embarrassing for them to be stuck in a place where they care so little about social justice and equality,” Kousaka said. “It’s hard for me to take it personally, because it is so different to the way I see things.” Kishida has taken a cautious stance, citing a clause in Japan’s civil code that states marriage is a union between a man and a woman. In court cases across Japan, campaigners are challenging the premise that marriage can only take place between heterosexual couples. Around 250 municipalities, including Tokyo, have introduced partnership certificates for same-sex couples allowing them to rent apartments and sign documents in medical emergencies, and for inheritance. But they are not legally binding, and same-sex couples can find themselves barred from visiting each other in hospital and from gaining access to other services available to married couples. Kousaka, a therapist at a university in Tokyo, and her partner have discussed their long-term future, but for now, getting married in Japan seems as distant a prospect as it did when they met several years ago. “It’s about being valued in terms of how the government and the rest of society see you as a person. The lack of recognition that you have equal rights sends the message that you are not important … that you don’t really exist.”</body>

    <head>US Senate passes bill protecting same-sex marriage</head>
    <body>The US Senate has passed the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation to protect same-sex unions that Democrats are hurrying to get to Joe Biden to be signed into law before Republicans take over the House next year. Related: ‘No rings, no guests’: supreme court fears spur LGBTQ ‘shotgun’ weddings The House must now pass the bill, a step the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, said could come as soon as Tuesday 6 December. Nearly 50 House Republicans supported the measure earlier this year. In the Senate, support from 12 Republicans was enough to override the filibuster and advance the bill to Tuesday’s majority vote, which ended 61-36. Although the Respect for Marriage Act would not codify Obergefell v Hodges, the 2015 supreme court decision which made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, it would require states to recognise all marriages that were legal when performed, including in other states. Interracial marriages would also be protected, with states required to recognise legal marriage regardless of “sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin”. Same-sex marriage has been thought under threat since June, when the conservative-dominated supreme court struck down the right to abortion. Then, the hardline justice Clarence Thomas wrote that other privacy-based rights, including same-sex marriage, could be reconsidered next. Public support for same-sex marriage is at an all-time high of around 70% but according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, if the supreme court did overturn the right, at least 29 states would be able to enforce bans. Before the vote on Tuesday, the US transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, wrote on Twitter: “Strange feeling, to see something as basic and as personal as the durability of your marriage come up for debate on the Senate floor. “But I am hopeful that they will act to protect millions of families, including ours, and appreciate all that has gone into preparing this important legislation to move forward.” After the vote, Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island, said the Respect for Marriage Act would “place the right to marry out of this activist supreme court’s reach. We affirm what the American people already understand: every person deserves the freedom to marry the one they love.” James Esseks, director of the LGBTQ &amp; HIV Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, pointed to the need for more work. In a statement, he said: “For the last seven years, LGBTQ+ families across the country have been able to build their lives around their right to marriage equality. The Respect for Marriage Act will go a long way to ensure an increasingly radical supreme court does not threaten this right, but LGBTQ+ rights are already under attack nationwide. “Transgender people especially have had their safety, dignity, and healthcare threatened by lawmakers across the country, including by members of this Congress. While we welcome the historic vote on this measure, members of Congress must also fight like trans lives depend on their efforts because trans lives do.” In his opinion in the abortion case, Thomas did not mention interracial marriage. The justice, who is Black, is married to the conservative activist Ginni Thomas, who is white. The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is white. His wife, the former transportation secretary Elaine Chao, is Asian American. McConnell has voted against the Respect for Marriage Act. On Tuesday, Biden, who as vice-president memorably came out in support of same-sex marriage before his boss, Barack Obama, said: “For millions of Americans, this legislation will safeguard the rights and protections to which LGBTQ+ and interracial couples and their children are entitled. “It will also ensure that, for generations to follow, LGBTQ+ youth will grow up knowing that they too can lead full, happy lives and build families of their own.” Biden thanked senators for their “bipartisan achievement” and said he “look[ed] forward to welcoming them at the White House after the House passes this legislation and sends it to my desk, where I will promptly and proudly sign it into law”. On Monday, before a test vote, the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, also praised Republicans who backed the measure, saying: “A decade ago, it would have strained all of our imaginations to envision both sides talking about protecting the rights of same-sex married couples.” Republicans argued for amendments they say won the support of religious groups that nonetheless oppose same-sex marriage, among them the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “They see this as a step forward for religious freedom,” Thom Tillis of North Carolina told the Associated Press. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, a Democrat and the first openly gay senator, told the AP the way some Republicans came round on the issue reminded her “of the arc of the LBGTQ+ movement to begin with, in the early days when people weren’t out and people knew gay people by myths and stereotypes”. With growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights, Baldwin said, “slowly laws have followed. It is history.” Associated Press contributed reporting • This article was amended on 30 November 2022. Thom Tillis is a senator from North Carolina, not South Carolina.</body>

    <head>Hormone shots could be used as treatment for low sex drive</head>
    <body>People with a low sex drive could benefit from injections of a hormone called kisspeptin, according to clinical trials that found the shots can boost sexual responses. The trials are the first to show the hormone can increase activity in brain regions linked to arousal and attraction in men and women who are distressed by their low libidos. Beyond increasing sex-related brain activity, researchers said some women who received the hormone reported feeling “more sexy”, while men had improved “happiness about sex” and increased “penile tumescence” when watching an erotic film as part of the study. One 44-year-old man on the trial, who said he had struggled to maintain relationships because his sexual appetite was so low, went on to have a son after his partner conceived in the same week he received the hormone. “I had the best possible outcome as a result of the trial,” he said. Kisspeptin is a natural hormone that stimulates the release of other reproductive hormones in the body. Previous studies have shown that shots of kisspeptin can enhance how people with healthy libidos react to sexual stimuli and boost activity in parts of the brain involved in sexual attraction. In two separate trials published in Jama Network Open, researchers led by Prof Waljit Dhillo and Dr Alexander Comninos, both consultant endocrinologists at Imperial College London, investigated the effects of kisspeptin injections in 32 women and 32 men with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). The condition, which is defined by low sexual desire that is distressing to the individual, affects about 10% of women and 8% of men. Brain scans from the trial participants suggest that the hormone can dampen down hyperactivity in regions linked to HSDD while boosting activity in key sexual regions of the brain. An additional measurement of the males found that penile rigidity, measured as they watched an erotic video as part of the trial, increased up to 56% compared with a placebo. “The predominant theory in HSDD suggests that there is excess self-monitoring and introspection, for example, how am I performing, how do I look, what does my partner think, which blunts downstream sexual desire and arousal,” said Comninos. “In these studies we have shown that kisspeptin may be able to address this imbalance and promote sexual pathways in both women and men distressed by low sexual desire.” Given the apparent benefits of kisspeptin and the lack of reported side-effects, the researchers believe the hormone is ripe to be developed as a treatment for HSDD. “Collectively, the results suggest that kisspeptin may offer a safe and much-needed treatment for HSDD that affects millions of people around the world,” Dhillo said.</body>

    <head>The Observer view on the dangers of exploiting child sex abuse for political gain</head>
    <body>Child sexual abuse is a heinous crime that evokes a strong emotional reaction because it is so hard to make sense of. What kind of adult would do that to a child? But it is also more common than often acknowledged: conservative estimates suggest 15% of girls and 5% of boys experience some form of sexual abuse before the age of 16, which makes it as common as physical and emotional abuse. Every so often, stories about terrible scandals involving child sexual abuse – from grooming gangs to Jimmy Savile to football clubs – punctuate the public consciousness. But the reality that underpins the headlines is that child sexual abuse affects every community; abuse within the family is most common and social services pick up just a fraction of the abuse that happens, leaving hundreds of thousands of children to suffer alone. There are huge problems in how we detect, respond to and try to prevent child sexual abuse as a society. Because it is such a stigmatised crime, it is unusual for children to verbally disclose the fact and professionals who work with children often have inadequate training in the signs of child sexual abuse and routinely under-detect it. Because it is so uncomfortable for us as adults to confront the fact that child abusers walk among us – certainly in our own communities, sometimes in our own families – there is a tendency to “other” child sexual abuse as a crime: to see it as something people not like us do to children we don’t know. Thus the justified stigma actively undermines efforts to safeguard children from this form of abuse. Irresponsible political leaders see the emotional reaction child sex abuse evokes in the public and cynically exploit it Responsible political leaders would help us to face the true nature and extent of child sex abuse in order to create a culture where it can be prevented. Irresponsible political leaders see the strong emotional reaction that child sex abuse evokes in the public and spy an opportunity to cynically exploit it for political gain. Last week, we saw two abhorrent examples of this from both Conservatives and Labour. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, wrongly claimed that the majority of perpetrators who sexually abuse children in grooming gangs are “almost all British-Pakistani”. This is patently false. The Home Office’s own research review in 2020 concluded that the majority of group-based child sex offending is perpetrated by white offenders, and while some studies suggest an over-representation of Asian and black offenders compared with the overall population, it is not possible to draw general conclusions because this data is not representative. This rhetoric is dangerous on two counts: first, it is racist and wrongly gives the impression that men of a particular ethnicity are more likely to be sex offenders; and second because it contributes to the “othering” of child sex abuse as a crime that means adults are less likely to be aware of child sexual abuse in their own communities. It is true that in Rotherham, sensitivities around race contributed to the failure of local councillors and officials to act on evidence of these crimes. But the reasons that victims and their parents were ignored were multifaceted: the misogynistic and classist attitudes among police that led some officers to believe children as young as 11 could consent to being raped by adult men were also critical. For Braverman to make false claims about the ethnicity of perpetrators for her own political ends is unforgivable. It comes in the wake of Boris Johnson last year falsely claiming that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute the prolific abuser Jimmy Savile while director of public prosecutions. The Labour party has shown it is no better. On Thursday, it released an ad on social media that claimed that Rishi Sunak doesn’t believe adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison. The “evidence” for this statement is the fact that Labour party analysis of Ministry of Justice data shows 4,500 adults convicted of a range of child sex offences served no prison time since 2010. Sunak was not even an elected MP for five of these years. It is true that the government has oversight of the independent sentencing council, which issues sentencing guidelines, and that in relation to some offences, parliament has introduced minimum custodial circumstances that must be imposed unless there are exceptional circumstances. But within the sentencing guidelines it is up to the independent judiciary to determine sentences for convicted offenders, and it is common for judges and magistrates to have considerable discretion. The data certainly does not support the claim that Sunak believes adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should not go to prison. It is true that Conservative underfunding of the justice system has made it harder for all victims – including children – to achieve justice. But whether it’s coming from Boris Johnson, Braverman or Keir Starmer, the idea that the major factor in societal failures to tackle child sexual abuse is that either Starmer or Sunak is “soft” on convicted child sex offenders is ludicrous and damaging. We live in a world where misleading information increasingly gets tossed around for short-term political advantage, despite the impact on longer-term voter cynicism. But for politicians to construct a political football out of child sexual abuse marks a grim new low in our political discourse. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    <head>Former acting Met commissioner allegedly called bulk of rape complaints ‘regretful sex’</head>
    <body>One of Britain’s most senior police officers is being investigated over allegations he described the “bulk” of rape complaints as “regretful sex”. Sir Stephen House, a former deputy commissioner and acting commissioner of the Metropolitan police, was referred to the independent police watchdog over the accusation. His alleged comments were made public by Home Office adviser Prof Betsy Stanko, who conducted a review into the number of rape cases making it to court. House denied the claims, first reported by Channel 4 News, and said he finds the term regretful sex “abhorrent”. In the latest institutional sexism row to hit the Met, Stanko accused House of making the comments to her at a Scotland Yard meeting in January 2022, when he was deputy commissioner. “It felt as if [House] was trying to minimise what the problem was, not taking it seriously,” she told Channel 4 News. “He used terms to describe – or a term to describe – what he thought the bulk of the rape complaints were, which was the term ‘regretful sex’. “The only way I understand the term regretful sex – and it was said by officers elsewhere, in the other forces that we visited and researched – it is something about the victim. Again, the victim is mistaken.” Stanko added: “That that fault line of forcible sex, which is rape, was not crossed because it must have been confusion. The problem was about confusion, not about the facts or the evidence that could have been collected if one was trying to investigate a rape.” The current deputy commissioner, Lynne Owens, confirmed the force was aware of “an allegation that the comments were made by a senior officer” and had referred the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The Home Office confirmed Suella Braverman, the home secretary, backed the decision for House to step back from a review into policing productivity. A spokesperson said: “Now it has been referred to the IOPC, the home secretary has agreed with National Police Chiefs’ Council chair, Martin Hewitt, that Sir Stephen House steps back from the review into the productivity of policing.” House told Channel 4 News in a statement that he “categorically denied” using the phrase “regretful sex”. He said: “I have dedicated over four decades of public service to protecting the public from predatory offenders. “I categorically deny using the phrase ‘regretful sex’. These are not words I have ever used in relation to rape or sexual assault and the reason I am so certain that I did not say this is because I simply do not believe it. I find the phrase abhorrent. “I find this characterisation of me to be deeply upsetting and colleagues who know me know how untrue it is.” Channel 4 News reported that, of two other people who were understood to have attended the meeting, one said he “did not recall” the comments while the other confirmed Stanko’s account. The allegations come days after a public inquiry heard undercover Met officers deceived women into sexual relationships because of a culture of “endemic” sexism.</body>

    <head>‘He took everything away’: inside a depraved and devastating sex cult</head>
    <body>In the fall of 2010, a group of sophomores at Sarah Lawrence College, a small liberal arts school 12 miles north of New York City, moved into a campus building called Slonim Woods 9. It was a laid-back college house – dirty kitchen, a lot of hanging out and being high, a half-thought plan to dump sand in one room and make a beach. So it was weird when one of the roommates, Talia Ray, invited her dad, Lawrence “Larry” Ray, to crash on their couch after he was released from prison on vague charges, but not, as several explain in a new Hulu docuseries, that weird. Ray made steak dinners, regaled his daughter’s friends with tales of his time in the marines and psy-ops for the CIA, promised to help some maximize their potential. It was off-putting to some, entrancing to others. Related: ‘The families deserve answers’: inside the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women Over the course of several months, Ray seemed to gain control over several of the housemates – first his daughter Talia’s friend Isabella Pollok, then Talia’s boyfriend Santos Rosario, then another, then another. “Everyone thought Talia’s dad was weird, but then one by one he would get them alone, and suddenly he’s the greatest thing to happen to them,” says Raven Juarez, whose best friend and boyfriend both fell under Ray’s spell and cut off contact with her, in Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence. “I had a lot of theories, but none of them were are horrible as what was actually to come.” As several survivors of Ray’s abuse and former Sarah Lawrence students attest, the depth of Ray’s depravity, first reported by a viral and genuinely unbelievable New York Magazine story in April 2019, was so much worse than anyone imagined. Over more than a decade, Ray isolated several of the roommates, as well as Rosario’s two older sisters, and derailed their lives through psychological manipulation, sexual coercion, financial extortion and routine emotional and physical abuse, the scope and shadow of which exceed what a flurry of headlines about the “Sarah Lawrence sex cult” could capture. The three-part Hulu series recounts the beats of the original article from the perspective of several who were there, and extends far past it, into the long aftermath of his abuse and deprogramming from his conditioning. “What’s real? What’s the truth? I don’t know,” says Felicia Rosario, Santos’s older sister, who was still living with Ray when the New York article went live, in one of several sitdowns with film-makers in the months following his arrest in 2020. (Ray, now 63, was convicted on federal charges including sex trafficking, extortion and racketeering in April 2022; he was sentenced last month to 60 years in prison.) “He took away my career, my friends, my family. He took everything away so that all that’s left is me to him,” Rosario says later in the third episode, her perspective sharpened with time. “The rest of me just … there was no rest of me.” Stolen Youth sensitively outlines how Ray courted and corrupted attention, how he identified and manipulated insecurities and openness, how he warped therapy speak into psychological manipulation, almost entirely in the words of the people he controlled and the parents and friends he isolated them from. “Part of the goal of the project was to help people understand how this was possible,” the show’s director, Zach Heinzerling, told the Guardian. Ray’s trial released to the public ample video and audio evidence of Ray’s abuse: harrowing footage of Felicia breaking down in paranoid fear of assassins out to get her, of Santos crumbling as Ray berates him for “breaking” tools he did not touch, of Ray hitting their friend Daniel Levin for unknown “infractions.” “This footage of them was released to the public, a lot of news sources were just playing these videos, Isabella was listed as Larry’s lieutenant and wife, and there’s very little understanding of her story and how she got there,” said Heinzerling. “The same is true of all of them – it became kind of like a headline-grabby story.” It was Levin who contacted Heinzerling in 2019, shortly after the article was published, to create a documentary from the perspective of and aimed at survivors, particularly Santos, his sister Yalitza and Claudia Drury, whose whereabouts were unknown, and Felicia and Pollok, who at the time were still living with Ray in New Jersey. “I wanted it to just be the inside story and for the audience to really feel like they were in the shoes of these individuals,” said Heinzerling. “So you can really understand what it means, what gaslighting means, or what love-bombing means, or many of these heady terms mean.” (The Rosario siblings, Levin and Pollok appear throughout the series; Talia Ray and Drury, who testified in Ray’s trial that he coerced her into prostitution for years to pay millions for fictional property damage, declined to participate.) Lawrence ‘Larry’ Ray, who was sentenced last month to 60 years in prison. Photograph: Hulu The first episode conjures the headspace of being 18 again – technically an adult, but in many ways unformed, adrift, malleable. “You’re still very much figuring out so many different things, and this is the first time you’re away from your parents, and you’re encouraged to make new relationships with older people,” said Heinzerling. Ray, a shadowy figure who never actually served in the marines, exuded coveted experience, ambition and curiosity. Santos recalls how reclusive Pollok, reeling from a breakup, seemed “vibrant” after spending hours “talking” with Ray behind closed doors, how he found Ray’s assuredness comforting after years of secretly struggling with depression. When Levin confided that he was struggling in a tumultuous relationship and questioning his sexuality, Ray shut it down with straightforward advice and hard lines: you’re not gay, dump your girlfriend. “He’s like, here is how to be an adult,” Levin says, recalling a feeling of empowerment and control that lured him in; soon after, he moved in with Ray, Santos Rosario, Drury, Pollok and Talia Ray in the one-bedroom apartment Ray occupied on the Upper East Side. The first two episodes present, through Ray’s extensive audio and video footage (he taped most calls and filmed the “therapy” sessions used to bully and abuse his victims), the descent into Ray’s sadistic manipulation and paranoid delusions; over years, he convinced Santos, Drury and Yalitza that they had poisoned him, Talia, Felicia and Isabella (who were both sexually and romantically involved with Ray). The third begins in aftermath – with Ray’s arrest in January 2020, Felicia Rosario and Pollok were left alone in a cluttered, partially destroyed New Jersey house, still isolated from their families and still convinced of Ray’s persecution by “corrupt” government figures. In an interview with film-makers weeks after his arrest, both state matter-of-factly that they’d been poisoned. It’s a discomforting watch, seeing the grip of Ray’s manipulation in real time. “When someone is in a coercive mindset, it’s important to meet them where they are, and sympathize with their situation, as they are seeing it,” said Heinzerling of filming Pollok and Felicia Rosario over several years, in various states of attachment to Ray’s coercive thinking. “Over time, the process of listening to someone tell their story, from a non-judgmental stance, can have the effect of making them reconsider the story they are telling, or allow them to face what they are potentially trying to hide within themselves.” Heinzerling connected Isabella and Felicia to a nonprofit for legal and housing support and, offered to film as a “mirror to one’s own experience,” easing back into everyday life. Over time, Felicia slowly detaches from Ray’s conditioning, first through doubt, then re-establishing memories corrupted by Ray, reconnecting with her old self; a Harvard and Columbia-educated doctor, she was weeks away from completing her psychiatry residency in LA when Ray convinced her she had to flee his persecutors and join him in New York. Eventually, she reframes her time with Ray and reconnects with her siblings and parents, Dominican immigrants to the Bronx who sold their house to pay for Ray’s extortions. Pollok, often referred to in headlines as Ray’s “lieutenant,” continues to see him as a benevolent figure and refuses contact from her mother, who appears in the series and hasn’t seen her daughter since 2010. On camera, Pollok stresses over her dwindling legal options; last September, she pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money with Ray and faces five years in prison. Others – Levin, Santos and Yalitza Rosario, the friends who see the red flags much clearer in retrospect – are still processing what happened, reconciling the people they were before Ray with everything that happened after. “I hope it adds to a conversation about what it means to be in a cult, or what it means to be in a cultic relationship,” said Heinzerling. “The methods that are used are actually much more akin to a domestic violence or domestic abuse relationship,” he said. Unlike other famous cults – Nxivm (as seen in HBO’s The Vow), Jonestown – there was little ideological or financial motive to Ray’s crimes. Control was the end unto itself. The series aims to help viewers see how “young and energetic and impressionable they were,” said Heinzerling. “They were just going to college. So helping audiences understand that this could be you or this can happen to anyone is helpful and hopefully prevents things like this from happening again.” Stolen Youth: Inside the Sarah Lawrence cult is now available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in Australia, with a UK date to be announced Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 802 9999. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

    <head>My girlfriend wants sex on demand – even when I’m not in the mood</head>
    <body>My girlfriend, who is 50, wants me – I’m 65 – to be ready for sex the moment I walk through the door. But I’m not always in the mood and need sex to be more organic. It’s not that I don’t love her or find her attractive. Now I sometimes don’t want to go to her place because I feel forced – and that she will be angry, or want to end the relationship, if I don’t immediately have sex with her. You deserve to be fully heard regarding your sexual response and your own needs. I’m wondering if intimidation and threats are part of your overall relationship and, if so, it needs to be reevaluated. It’s not OK to feel forced or coerced in any dimension, let alone sex. Sit down with her and explain to her how your arousal pattern works – ask for what you need. When a person feels threatened, unsafe or overly challenged, it stops the physical arousal process even if the person mentally wants to comply. It’s a self-protection mechanism, so pay attention.

    <head>Stephen Bear jailed for 21 months for sharing sex video without consent</head>
    <body>The reality TV personality Stephen Bear has been sentenced to 21 months in prison for sharing a private video of him having sex with his ex-girlfriend Georgia Harrison, in a judgment confirming that sharing intimate images without consent is a serious crime. Bear was also ordered to sign the sex offender register and given a restraining order not to contact Harrison for five years. He will have notification requirements to keep police updated with his address and whereabouts for 10 years. Bear, 33, and Harrison, a fellow reality TV personality, were filmed on Bear’s CCTV cameras having sex in his garden in Loughton, Essex, on 2 August 2020. Harrison, who waived her right to anonymity, told Chelmsford crown court she did not know they were being filmed and had told Bear not to share the footage. She said he went on to share it on WhatsApp and online. Bear claimed he deleted the footage that day and had not shared it with anybody other than Harrison. In December, a jury found him guilty of two counts of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress. He was also found guilty by a majority verdict of 10 jurors to two of voyeurism. Judge Morgan said Bear had been motivated by a wish “to exploit the economic value of the recording”, and that he had caused Harrison “extensive humiliation and embarrassment”. “I’m sure that you recognised the enhanced economic value to you by having Georgia Harrison, a well-known reality TV and social media personality, in the video,” the judge told Bear during sentencing. After Bear was jailed, he waved from the dock and said: “Have a good evening. Enjoy the weekend everyone.” Speaking outside court, Harrison said she was “happy and relieved that this matter is finally over”. “Today’s sentence is a vindication of what I’ve been put through and sends a clear message that the police and the courts take this matter very seriously,” she said. “I want to let all other victims of this crime know that I stand in solidarity with them and I have absolutely no regrets on waiving my anonymity. “I hope that this puts anyone off committing this sort of crime and I hope for anyone else who has been a victim of it [that] it gives them some sort of justice.” Hannah von Dadelszen, the deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS East of England, said she hoped the case would encourage victims of other offenders to come forward, and that while Harrison had waived her right to do so anonymously, special measures could be put in place to safeguard people’s privacy. She said: “I want to commend Georgia Harrison for the bravery and determination she has shown throughout this case. By contrast, Stephen Bear showed a complete lack of remorse by never accepting responsibility for his abusive behaviour, even going so far as to place the blame on Ms Harrison. “Although she lives a public life, Georgia Harrison has the right to privacy. But that was taken away by Bear to make money in the most egregious way.” Bear appeared on MTV’s Ex on the Beach and won Celebrity Big Brother in 2016, while Harrison has appeared on Love Island and The Only Way is Essex. Ruth Davison, the chief executive officer of the charity Refuge, said: “I hope that by the court imposing a custodial sentence, that a precedent will be set, and a warning sign sent to perpetrators that intimate image abuse is a very serious crime and that the justice system recognises that.” Eleanor Leedham, a solicitor specialising in data protection and technology law at Keller Postman, said the strength of the ruling was significant because “the tech-enabled threat of image-based abuse shared via WhatsApp and OnlyFans, such as in the case of Mr Bear, is often connected to domestic abuse, coercive control, and damage to mental health and even suicide”. She said many public websites, including OnlyFans, had “inadequate checks and processes to prevent the upload of illegal images” and urged the government to use the online safety bill to force adult websites “to clean up their act”.</body>

    <head>The orgasm gap – and how to close it: ‘Don’t equate sex and penetration’</head>
    <body>When Rachel Bilson, once a star of the 00s teen drama The OC and more recently a host of a podcast about the show, said that she didn’t have an orgasm through penetrative sex with a man until she was 38, she poked alight a smouldering conversation about “the orgasm gap”. The phrase doesn’t refer to those years of waiting, between discovering sex and meeting someone who does it right. That would be like calling a life sentence a gap year. Rather, it’s a play on the pay gap: the difference in the number of orgasms men and women report during straight sex. According to research by the condom manufacturer Durex, straight men have four times as many orgasms as straight women, although that fudges the figures a little: 20% of men and 5% of women answered “always” when asked whether they orgasm during sexual encounters. The OC star and podcaster Rachel Bilson. Photograph: Paras Griffin/Getty Images The International Academy of Sex Research conducted a more rigorous study in 2017 and found that 95% of heterosexual men said they usually or always orgasmed when sexually intimate, followed by 89% of gay men, 88% of bisexual men, 86% of lesbian women, 66% of bisexual women and 65% of straight women. If orgasm parity between genders and sexualities was your goal, you might say women should have sex with women and straight men should stop lying; then everyone would end up climaxing about 90% of the time. The orgasm gap situates sex within an inequality discourse, where straight women are the losers and straight men the winners But before straight people give up having sex with each other to meet their orgasm targets, we need to address some fallacies. First, if you make penetrative sex the only thing that counts, it will always be easier for men to climax – and that is not because they are selfish or not concentrating. “The glans of the penis is very sensitive, so any movement is highly pleasurable and it’s easier to ejaculate,” says the sex therapist Silva Neves. “The clitoris is not quite in the right place for getting to climax in penetration.” Climaxing after clitoral stimulation by other means still counts as an orgasm. “Penetration is great – lots of people find it highly pleasurable – but it’s important not to equate sex and penetration,” says Neves. “Oral sex is also sex, mutual masturbation is also sex, using sex toys with your partner is also sex.” People often say the problem is a failure of communication between partners, who lack the language and the openness to be clear about what they want, but I think there is something beneath even that: a Fordist understanding of sex, where everyone is built the same and wants the same thing. “People try to go online to find out what is the best position, how do you make yourself the best lover,” Neves says. By that rationale – that there is an objective scale of excellence, in which climax is a key performance indicator – even to say what feels good is an implied criticism, because someone who was good at it would already know. But that rationale is irrational. No two people are the same; even within one person, there will be wild variations of arousal according to who we are with and how we feel on the day. “We really need to get away from the idea that sex is a pass or fail, a good or bad. It’s about two people getting pleasure from each other,” says Neves. Of course, so many of these frames are counterproductive. When we talk about an orgasm gap, we situate sex within an inequality discourse, where straight women are the losers and straight men the winners. That is the last place you would start if you wanted to have an open, intimate conversation. When we situate climax during intercourse as the bullseye, we gate off the idiosyncrasy and experimentation that are the wellspring of sexual pleasure. One more thing, says Neves. “A lot of people have sex at night, when they’ve had dinner. That’s not the best time: you’re bloated, you’re tired.” He suggests having sex before dinner. Some things are universal, I guess – everyone is tired after dinner.</body>

    <head>Anchorman director to sell Sex Panther prop in climate fund auction</head>
    <body>It may smell like pure gasoline, but it could now help Just Stop Oil. The director of Anchorman is selling the film’s original Sex Panther cologne (“Yep, it’s made with bits of real panther, so you know it’s good”) to raise money for climate protesters. The prop is just one memento being auctioned from the personal collection of Adam McKay, who was also behind the climate satire Don’t Look Up, to raise money for the Climate Emergency Fund. Other lots for sale include a walk-on role in his next film, his prized vintage Marvel comics, and vintage autographed basketball cards, including a one-of-a-kind 1980 Topps Bird, Erving, Johnson scoring leader card. The card has been signed by the actors who play Larry Bird (Sean Patrick Small) and Magic Johnson (Quincy Isaiah) on the HBO show Winning Time. Adam McKay holding a climate clock during a climate change protest in Los Angeles last year. Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP McKay said: “People in Hollywood auction off stuff they’ve collected for a bunch of different reasons: bankruptcy, a divorce, death, impending death etc. As for me, I’m freaked out about the ongoing climate emergency. Come take advantage of my profound existential fear and get some cool stuff, so we can raise money to fight for action!” The fund gives money to the A22 Network, a group of 11 organisations in 11 western democracies, including Letzte Generation (Germany), Derniere Renovation (France), Ultima Generazione (Italy) and Just Stop Oil (UK). Insulate Britain, whose roadblock protests last autumn polarised public opinion but catalysed a national debate around its demand to insulate every home, were also funded by CEF. Most donations to CEF come from wealthy individuals and family foundations. It was started with a $500,000 donation from Aileen Getty, the granddaughter of Jean Paul Getty, whose petrochemical empire made him the world’s richest man – a source of some controversy in the climate activist world.</body>

    <head>Ghislaine Maxwell faces hard road in bid to overturn sex-trafficking conviction</head>
    <body>When Ghislaine Maxwell’s legal team appealed her December 2021 conviction for helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls, her new lead attorney largely reiterated complaints she had long made about the high-criminal proceedings. The attorney, Arthur Aidala, said Maxwell was a “proxy” for Epstein who was prosecuted “to satisfy public outrage over an unpopular non-prosecution agreement and the death of the person responsible for the crimes”. Epstein, who was arrested in July 2019 for sex-trafficking teenage girls, died in jail a month later in August, pending trial. Maxwell was arrested in July 2020. Related: Ghislaine Maxwell wishes she ‘never met’ Jeffrey Epstein, she tells TV interviewer Aidala, who represented Harvey Weinstein in the disgraced film producer’s Manhattan rape trial, also contended that Maxwell was so overwhelmed by “inhumane conditions” in jail that “by time of trial, she was so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her own defense, much less to testify”. But Aidala’s comments might have been aimed more at generating sympathetic media coverage than being a predictor of the appeal’s likely success. Maxwell cannot mount an appeal based on her own claims that she was a hapless surrogate for Epstein, or too tired at trial. Her legal team will have to argue instead that there were legal errors in proceedings against her that necessitate a verdict reversal, and that is where her bid to have her conviction overturned will succeed or – according to many legal experts – more likely fail. Indeed, Aidala contends that New York federal prosecutors flouted an old non-prosecution agreement which, he claimed, barred charges for being brought against Maxwell in relation to Epstein’s crimes. The non-prosecution agreement was a provision of Epstein’s controversial 2007 plea deal in Florida, which let him avoid federal charges over allegations of sexual crimes. “As a matter of due process, the government should be held to the highest standards of both promise and performance in its agreement with its citizens,” Aidala said of the non-prosecution provision. Aidala also maintained that Maxwell’s right to a fair trial was denied due to the imbroglio with juror Scotty David. During jury selection, David did not disclose that he had been sexually abused as a child – a question which was asked of potential jurors – prompting Maxwell’s attorneys to request a new trial. David, who claimed he did not disclose this on a juror questionnaire due to distraction, said in post-trial interviews that he discussed this alleged abuse with his fellow jurors, which let them see things from a victim’s perspective. The judge, Alison Nathan, rejected Maxwell’s bid for a new trial over David’s omission. Maxwell was “denied her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury when a juror revealed that he gave made materially false statements in jury selection that concealed that he had experienced the ‘exact same thing’ as the victims, namely, childhood sexual abuse”, Aidala also said. “To compound the error, during jury deliberations, he used his undisclosed prior experience to convince other jurors that the defendant was guilty.” While Aidala has cited these alleged errors of law in public statements, proving them to the second circuit court of appeals and convincing an appellate panel that these issues were egregious enough to overturn Maxwell’s conviction and order a new trial is a hard road to travel. Court administration data from 2015 indicate that less than 9% of federal appeals resulted in reversals of lower courts. “The likelihood of the second circuit reversing her trial verdict is close to zero,” said Ron Kuby, a longtime criminal defense attorney with a focus on civil rights. “The second circuit tends to uphold almost all criminal convictions as a general matter.” In the rare cases the second circuit does reverse a trial court outcome, leading to a new trial, it is typically because prosecutors have over-stretched a legal theory – or because the US supreme court has made a decision that affects proceedings in lower courts, Kuby said. “But Maxwell’s trial was none of that – the Maxwell trial was all very well-plowed legal territory,” Kuby said. The proceedings against Maxwell – which stemmed from serving as Epstein’s procurer of victims – were not complicated by racketeering counts, nor convoluted bribery charges. “It’s like very, very, very fancy trappings, but fundamentally, it’s the prosecution of a pimp, which is not that complicated,” Kuby said.

Photograph: Patrick McMullan/Getty Images Speaking generally of appeals, veteran criminal defense attorney Kevin Faga said if an appeals court doesn’t find an error of law, the petition won’t go anywhere. It’s a “hard burden to prove that there was an error of law”. “Her lawyers will have to convince an appellate court that there was an error in the law made by the trial court, and if they’re successful, the appellate court has to determine” whether the error warrants a retrial or further investigation before they determine whether a retrial should be had, Faga said. An appeals panel can order that the case return to the lower trial court for a hearing on various issues. Rachel Fiset, co-founder of Los Angeles firm Zweiback, Fiset &amp; Zalduendo, said she thought a successful appeal was “unlikely”. While Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, will probably fail in her appeal, there is still a reason for her to try. “She’s looking at a very long sentence, and they are looking at ways to have it overturned, and there are not any options beyond an appeal,” Fiset said. “She doesn’t have very much to lose other than the cost of the appeal. “It’s not uncommon for people with a lot of means to appeal their conviction in the hopes that it’s overturned. Maxwell has remained very steadfast that she has not committed these crimes and that it’s not her fault, so the appeal is not surprising.”</body>

    <head>Discovered in the deep: the anglerfish with vampire-like sex lives</head>
    <body>“I sometimes describe anglerfish as looking like a satanic potato,” says James Maclaine, senior curator of fish at London’s Natural History Museum, who believes a new species of the fish may have been discovered. Many anglerfish are globular and lumpy in shape. They have a long prong sprouting from their forehead with a glowing tip that lures prey into their enormous, tooth-filled jaws. If their appearance is curious, then the method of reproduction that some species have developed – known as sexual parasitism – is even more so. A young female black seadevil anglerfish. Males of this species do not attach permanently to the female. Photograph: Chris Fletcher/NHM Anglerfish reign supreme in the permanent darkness of the ocean’s midnight zone, between 1,000 and 4,000 metres down. There are at least 170 deep-sea anglerfish species. “No other vertebrate group comes close to anglerfish in terms of variety and number of forms at that depth,” says Maclaine. The truth about the sex lives of anglerfish was discovered in 1925 by Charles Tate Regan, an ichthyologist at the Natural History Museum. When people saw smaller fish attached to larger anglerfish, they presumed they were juveniles stuck to their mothers. And when other specimens of these little fish were found on their own, they were thought to be a totally different family of anglerfish. But in both cases they turned out to be diminutive males that belonged to families of anglerfish that had already been discovered. In some species of anglerfish, including a very rare footballfish (Himantolophus melanolophus), the small male tracks down a female and bites on to her. When she releases her eggs, he fertilises them then swims off into the dark to search for another mate. The ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths. As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, a new Guardian Seascape series will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect. In other species – such as the stargazing seadevil (Ceratias uranoscopus) and the triplewart seadevil (Cryptopsaras couesii) – it’s a permanent arrangement. A male latches on to a female, their body tissues fuse and he never lets go. Only then does he grow a pair of testes and become sexually mature. “He will connect to her blood supply and feed off the nutrients in her blood like a little vampire,” says Maclaine. This extreme strategy of anglerfish mating was filmed for the first time in the wild in 2018. A female anglerfish can collect several males. “The record that I’m aware of is eight,” says Maclaine. In some species, the males always fix in a similar place, usually near her rear where eggs are released. Others, including those seeking permanent attachment, clamp anywhere on the females including her head and even glowing lure. Sometimes, scientists find males fixed to a female of a different species. “I don’t know whether that’s just desperation or misidentification,” Maclaine says. An unidentified male anglerfish. Male anglerfish do not have a glowing lure on their heads but often have very large nostrils to help them detect a female. Photograph: Chris Fletcher/NHM A 2020 study revealed that to adopt their parasitic mates, female anglerfish turn down – and even completely abandon – major parts of their immune system. By altering the genes involved in detecting foreign cells, including those producing antibodies, females don’t react to the hitchhiking males and rather accept them as part of their own body. “They still have some kind of immune system, but as to how that works, nobody knows,” says Maclaine. Related: Discovered in the deep: the extraordinary sawshark with a weapon-like snout A new species of anglerfish may have just been discovered. A black, golf-ball sized juvenile was brought up in a trawl net off Saint Helena in the mid-Atlantic on a recent expedition as part of the Blue Belt programme, which studies the waters around the UK’s Overseas Territories. Maclaine realised it was unusual because of its elaborate lure, like a minute bouquet of flowers. This feature is only known in footballfish. Just six specimens of footballfish have so far been found, so Maclaine’s catch may be one of those – or something new, he says. As soon as the research ship returns to the UK in a couple of months and Maclaine has access to the specimen, he plans to make detailed drawings of its lure, unfurling the intricate tendrils that will have been scrunched up. For this kind of identification, drawings are more useful than photographs. “After preservation, a picture won’t really do it justice,” he says. Then Maclaine will send his drawings to the world’s leading anglerfish expert, Ted Pietsch at the University of Washington, to see if he has, indeed, found a new species.</body>

    <head>Secret sex signals: love languages of long-term couples – from aubergine emojis to extreme eye contact</head>
    <body>Name: Secret signals. Age: Ancient. Appearance: A beaver emoji followed by an aubergine emoji. I don’t get it. Yes, you do. If somebody sent you an emoji of a beaver followed by an emoji of an aubergine, what do you think it might mean? Wait … I’ve got it. Took you a while, but well done. It means: “We need to buy more aubergines.” No, not at all. It’s a sex thing. Oh! Well, who would send such filth? Former professional footballer Peter Crouch, that’s who. His wife Abbey Clancy went on a podcast and explained that this is his secret method of seduction. OK, not sure we needed to know that. Does it work? Unsure. As Clancy explained: “How vile is that? Am I supposed to go: ‘Oh yeah, now I’m bang up for it’?” So why does he send them? Because it’s a secret signal, that’s why. They’re what you do if you want to communicate something to your other half, but you don’t want anyone else to know. Most couples have them in one form or another. Like if you want to leave a party? Exactly. Some people will yawn at their spouse, or kick them under the table, or dart their eyes towards the door, or pull their own ear. Are there other types of secret signal? Oh, hundreds. Some couples have a special “Not in front of people” stare that they deploy when their loved one is about to tell an embarrassing anecdote, or a “code red” look when something urgently needs to be discussed in private. And this isn’t just reserved for couples, either. It isn’t? Anyone with any passing interest in I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here will know that contestants often adopt strange little tics with their hands and faces, in a bid to remind their loved ones that they’re thinking of them. Fiendish. Of course, the master of this was the late Queen Elizabeth. Her staff claimed that you could always tell when she needed to be rescued from a boring conversation, because she would subtly shift her handbag from one hand to the next. As soon as she did this, someone would rush in and politely bustle her away. What a strange and complex subject this is. Steady on a minute. When Peter Crouch is horny, he literally sends his wife the closest thing he can find to a picture of a penis. It’s hardly cracking the Enigma machine, is it? Do say: “Peter Crouch’s secret sex signal is an aubergine emoji.” Don’t say: “Nothing says ‘secret’ like announcing it on a podcast.”</body>

    <head>What would changing the Equality Act mean for trans people and single-sex spaces?</head>
    <body>A controversial attempt to overhaul one of the hallmark pieces of equalities law is being considered by ministers. As they prepare to press ahead with a lengthy and convoluted process, we examine what the reforms would mean for trans people and those advocating for sex-based rights, as well as the motivations behind the move. What do ministers want to do? A significant change to the 2010 Equality Act is being pursued by the government, which would redefine “sex” to refer specifically to a person’s sex at birth. That would be designed to make it legal for those who are transgender to be banned from single-sex spaces and events, such as book groups and hospital wards. Related: Kemi Badenoch could rewrite law to allow trans exclusion from single-sex spaces Currently, trans people can have their identity formally recognised by applying for a gender recognition certificate. This affirms their gender change in law, allowing them to update their birth or adoption certificate and have their gender recognised on a marriage or death certificate. That process is not expected to change, but the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, wants to make a clearer distinction in law between those who are born a particular sex and those who transition or identify as a gender different from their birth one. This is a complicated thing to do, so Badenoch wrote to the Equality and Human Rights Commission seeking its advice. She said there was “increasing contestation” about “how the term sex is understood in law and in practice” and that there were “legitimate questions” about the current definition under the Equality Act. Badenoch acknowledged that such a change would involve “advantages and disadvantages” for affected groups, so wanted the UK’s human rights watchdog to give its verdict on the implications of such a move. No 10 has suggested it will push ahead, though the EHRC’s advice that there should be further consideration suggests the change may take considerable time to enact. What would be the impact? Those who advocate for sex-based rights say it would affirm hard-fought protections for those who are born biologically female. But the impact on trans people would probably be detrimental. The EHRC said itself that their legal protection from discrimination “may be unclear” given the difficulties of policing any kind of change in the law. In a letter to the government published this week, the body said that if trans women were banned from spaces or services for those born biologically female, “in practice, trans people are unlikely to be required to provide proof of their legal status”. Critics of changing the Equality Act also say trans people would feel they were being targeted, with the potential for real-world hostility towards them rising. Why is this happening? Badenoch has said that part of her reason for intervening was the recent decision by the UK government to block a bill passed by the Scottish parliament that was designed to make it easier for transgender people to obtain official gender recognition certificates. She said there were concerns the legislation would adversely affect the operation of the Equality Act, which applies in England, Scotland and Wales. A recent petition, which was signed by 107,000 people and called for the act to make clear “sex” related to biological sex and not someone’s gender, was also referred to by Badenoch. It is true, as well, that norms to do with gender identity have changed much since 2010. The EHRC said over the past 13 years, “society has evolved considerably in matters relating to the two protected characteristics of sex and gender reassignment” and that the original act uses the two terms interchangeably. Related: Sunak promises guidelines for schools on issues of gender identity Changing the Equality Act would also mark the delivery of a promise made by Sunak last summer. When Sunak first ran for the Tory leadership, his campaign said he would ensure “women’s sports and services are protected and clarify that self-ID does not have legal force” by amending the act to make clear “that sex means biological sex”. How would it come into force? Updating the current law, which was passed by Gordon Brown’s government, would probably require fresh primary legislation. This could either come in the form of a separate new bill, or be contained within another bill – if any relevant ones are planned before the next general election. Legal wrangling and inevitable court battles mean that even if the change was made before 2025, it could be months or even years before the issue is resolved. Instead, the Conservative party may keep the possibility of amending the Equality Act dangling – turning it into an election campaign pledge. This would both serve as an enticement to its more socially conservative voters who have become somewhat disillusioned with the party, and keep focus on an issue that has become uncomfortable territory for the Labour party. Could there be other motivations at play? Some Tories believe the push for sex-based rights is not just the right thing to do but ripe for electoral exploitation. Badenoch is one of those unafraid to push persistently on social issues such as gender and race. Some MPs believe she has one eye on building support among the right of the party – both in parliament and among the membership – in anticipation of another run for the leadership when there is next a vacancy.</body>

    <head>Succession recap: season four, episode one – Logan gets a sex tape from Cousin Greg</head>
    <body>Let a thousand sunflowers bloom, Romey. A 15-month wait and news that this would be the final season meant anticipation was higher than Cousin Greg after one of his first season bedroom bongs. Here’s all the polling data from the curtain-raising episode, titled The Munsters … Unhappy birthday to you Season four began, like season one, at the birthday bash of the cardigan-clad mogul Logan Roy (Brian Cox). After that failed coup by three of his children, this party was less of a family affair. “The rats” were conspicuous by their absence. His wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass), was “in Milan, shopping, for ever”. Among a roomful of sycophants – “fucking Munsters”, as our curmudgeonly host called them – there were too few political power players for Logan’s liking. His sole confidantes were his “friend, assistant and adviser” Kerry (Zoe Winters) and his bodyguard, Colin (Scott Nicholson). Logan escaped with the latter for a stroll through Central Park, a meal and some existential musings about the afterlife. Food aside, he had plenty on his plate. The deal to sell Waystar Royco to the tech mogul Lukas Mattson (Alexander Skarsgård) was going through in 48 hours. The US election was 10 days away. What really got the old warhorse’s juices flowing, though, was his plan to acquire Pierce Global Media – the rival conglomerate he had been considering for years. He intended to add it to his Fox-News-alike network ATN (unwanted by Mattson) to form a new empire. Except this strategy was about to be derailed. Enter the rebel alliance … Something old, something new Rebel alliance … Sarah Snook as Shiv Roy. Photograph: Home Box Office/HBO Over on the west coast, the next-gen Roys presented a united front for once. At a modernist mansion outside Los Angeles, they were meeting potential Saudi investors in their new media venture, TheHundred. Not to be confused with the gimmicky cricket tournament, this was “a one-stop info shop for smart people”. “It’s Substack meets Masterclass meets the Economist meets the New Yorker,” mumbled Kendall (Jeremy Strong) from beneath his baseball cap. Their heads were turned when Shiv (Sarah Snook) got a call from her estranged husband, Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), and rumbled their father’s acquisition of Pierce. Should they forget their startup and scupper their dad’s deal? Kendall wanted to shaft Logan. Shiv wanted to shaft Tom. Roman (Kieran Culkin) reluctantly came onboard. Patricide Plan B was go. Scramble the PJs. ‘Did you rummage to fruition?’ Oh, Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun). The leggy princeling had turned lecherous ladies’ man, but goofed by bringing an uninvited plus-one to Logan’s party. “What’s her full name?” snapped Kerry. “Is it Bridget Randomfuck? Is she from the apps? How do you know she’s not a hostile corporate asset?” As Tom mocked her “ludicrously capacious” Burberry bag, Bridget had the temerity to use bathroom towels, eat canapés and make conversation. Enough was enough when she asked Logan for a selfie, although sadly this occurred off-camera. Before she was ejected, she and Greg found time for a fumble in a guest bedroom. Big mistake. Logan’s Upper East Side duplex was rigged with CCTV cameras. “You’ve accidentally made him a sex tape,” crowed Tom. Cue Greg gallantly blaming Bridget and Logan cracking gags about smelling his finger. Succession aficionados have long tipped Greg for greatness. He looks several gargantuan handbags away from that. A Roy-al wedding With the election looming, spare part sibling Connor (Alan Ruck) was fretting on his presidential ambitions. He was polling at 1%, but even his “Conhead” supporter base was looking wobbly – he needed to spend big on media coverage. You could almost hear the cogs clanking as he had a brainwave. Why not exploit his impending nuptials to Willa (Justine Lupe) to seize some much-needed attention? How about marrying underneath the Statue of Liberty with a brass band and assorted hoopla? “It’s dumb, but I always wanted a nice wedding,” eye-rolled Willa, increasingly a scene-stealer. Rats 1 King 0 “I feel like we’re in the middle of a bidding war,” said the pearl-clutching matriarch Nan Pierce (Cherry Jones). That’s because you are, babes. At the Pierces’s swish holiday home, the siblings laid out their offer. Their financing was “robust”, but they wouldn’t “take your properties and roll them in the dirt” like evil pater. With Logan and his lieutenants at the other end of a phoneline, he was on the back foot for once. He tried to lighten the mood by getting his inner circle to give him a “roasting”, but, understandably, they were all too terrified. The king was missing his court jester, Roman. Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin as Kendall, Shiv and Roman Roy, AKA ‘the rats’. Photograph: HBO The contrast between the genteel Pierces, who pretend not to care about money, and the venal Roys, who care about little else, was beautifully portrayed once again. There was a tense back-and-forth before the siblings shook hands on the $10bn price Nan wanted all along. Low on blood sugar, Logan barked: “Congratulations on saying the biggest number, you fucking morons.” Ken and Shiv were jubilant. Roman had reservations. Too late, Romulus. Get ready to rumble. ‘It’s a sad, sad day when love dies’ Shark-eyed Shiv and Turncoat Tom were months into a trial separation. She had been busy dreaming up TheHundred, jetting to Dubai and having “talks about talks”. He had been busy dating models and buttering Logan’s beanpole. When Tom, in a superbly squirm-inducing scene, asked pop-in-law if his position would still be secure post-divorce, Logan’s grunted reply (“if we’re good, we’re good”) was ominously non-committal. When Shiv returned to their Broadway apartment to collect some clothes, she and Tom quietly agreed they had reached the end of the road. There were hints in the season three finale that Shiv might be pregnant, but no sign here. Was a miscarriage or abortion among the things Tom wanted to discuss but Shiv definitely didn’t? We ended on an affecting note, as they held hands while lying at right angles (visual metaphor alert) and wistfully sighed that they had “given it a go”. It’s Mondale the labradoodle I feel sorry for. Cut to Logan, giving ATN an armchair bollocking about their midnight bulletin. There’s fight in the old dog yet. Don’t bet against Logan … Photograph: HBO The heir apparent Tom is closest to Logan, but neither his deal-making nor impending divorce will impress. Shiv and Kendall are in the ascendant. Line of the week I enjoyed Roman’s “Dad could be twisting our turnips, playing the old fuck trombone”, Logan’s “ballsack in a toupée” and Shiv “checking in at Grey Gardens, going Mano a Nano”. But my prize goes to their summary of the paternal state-of-play. Roman: “We’re fine, it’s just a complicated private situation.” Shiv: “Whereby we all hate him.” Notes and observations That sepia title sequence was subtly tweaked, with a shot added of the StarGo app (complete with slow loading). Fleetingly glimpsed ATN headlines were: “China hack could see 40 million Americans entombed in their electric cars”, “Deep state blunder: classified docs displayed on NBA jumbotron” and “Man with bird flu can’t stop thinking of ducks”. Poor Naby the investor, getting off a 16-hour flight to be frisked by racist security guards, then repeatedly made to wait. Greg and Tom dubbing themselves “The Disgusting Brothers” echoed the “El Dude Brothers” in Jesse Armstrong’s 00s co-creation Peep Show. Party time! Ehhh! God, life is futile. No bingeing here, Roy-alists. Episode two airs next Monday, so rejoin us here afterwards for more “internecine family concerns and personal title-tattle”. In the meantime, Munsters, please leave your thoughts and theories below …</body>

    <head>Sex worker, survivor, Māori TV star: world’s first transgender MP remembered as trailblazer</head>
    <body>Believed to be the world’s first transgender person to become a member of parliament, Georgina Beyer is remembered in New Zealand for her courage, sharp, ribald humour and fierce advocacy of the communities she represented. The trailblazing MP – a former sex worker, sexual assault survivor, Māori woman and television star – entered parliament in 1999. She won the Wairarapa seat – once considered a rural, conservative stronghold – with a resounding victory and a 32% swing to Labour. Having served her community as mayor for five years, Beyer won over constituents with a straight-talking, upfront style and a constant presence at community events. In parliament, she became a force on behalf of the rainbow community, helping push forward progressive law reform on sex work and civil unions, often despite fierce opposition. When New Zealand sought to legalise civil unions between same-sex couples, conservative religious groups organised a mass “enough is enough” march to oppose the legislation. Beyer was on parliament steps to meet the chanting crowd. “I’m happy to stare you in the eye,” she said. “Why do you hate people like us?” “You’re not going to win – you haven’t,” she said. “I have trust in New Zealanders that they will be fair minded, as they always have been – that the democracy that I live in made it possible for somebody like me to be here, in this place.” Related: The trans ‘queen mother’ reclaiming Fiji’s third gender – photo essay “I will always remember her courage,” finance minister and former deputy prime minister Grant Robertson said on Monday. “I was with her on the steps of parliament when … [the] mob arrived to oppose civil unions, and then followed her when she went to confront them. With a mixture of awe and genuine fear for her safety, I saw the very best of Georgina that day.” Georgina Beyer at Auckland Rainbow Pride Parade in February 2020. Photograph: Sylvie Whinray/New Zealand Herald Former prime minister Helen Clark said on Monday that Beyer “showed tremendous courage” stepping into public life and “the public warmed to her honesty”. Her speech on sex work was credited with tipping the balance in favour of the prostitution reform bill, which passed by a narrow one-vote margin in 2003. The laws decriminalised sex work in New Zealand, aiming to create a safer environment in which sex workers could take exploitative employers to employment court, not gain a criminal record, and access support if they experienced violence. She spoke candidly about entering the sex industry as a young teenager, and being raped by a group of men. “I support this bill for all the prostitutes I have ever known who have died before the age of 20, because of the inhumanity and hypocrisy of a society that would not ever give them the chance to redeem whatever circumstances made them arrive in that industry,” she said. The law “provides people like me at that time with some form of redress for the brutalisation that might happen when a client pulls a knife,” she said. “It would have been nice to know that … I might have been able to approach the authorities-the police in this case-and say: “I was raped, and, yes, I’m a prostitute, and, no, it was not right that I should have been raped, because I said no.” New Zealand Prostitutes’ Collective grieved her passing on Monday, saying the collective “cannot put into words how deeply we mourn the passing of Georgina Beyer – an extraordinary woman who served her communities fearlessly”. An ex-screen actor, Beyer was also known for her sharp, sometimes bawdy humour. In her maiden speech to parliament, she joked: “I was quoted once as saying: “This was the stallion who became a gelding, and now she is a mayor.’’ I suppose I have to say that I have now found myself to be a member! I have come full circle, so to speak,” she said, as the house erupted into laughter. “Not that I wish that to be degrading in this House in any way, but I understand that a sense of humour is welcome.” She quipped that the skills of sex work and of political fundraising were essentially overlapping. In a 2018 interview with the Spinoff, she recalled strutting parliament’s halls, telling colleagues to “get out on the streets and sell their butts”. “Look, honey, you’re soliciting yourself either way,” she said. “One’s just for votes, the other for money. One advertises on billboards, the other advertises in the back pages of The Dominion Post.” While she sometimes downplayed the milestone in interviews, Beyer was also aware of the significance of her status as the first trans person to stand in the house. “This is a first not only in New Zealand, ladies and gentlemen, but also in the world. This is a historic moment,” she said in her maiden speech. “This country of ours leads the way in so many aspects. We led the way for women getting the vote, we have led the way in the past, and I hope we will do so again in the future – in social policy and certainly in human rights.” Beyer died on Monday, age 65, after a long illness. Announcing that she had died in hospice care, friends said “she was cracking jokes and had a twinkle in her eye, right until the final moment”. • This article was amended on 9 March 2023. Georgina Beyer entered Parliament in 1999, not in 2005 as an earlier version said.</body>

    <head>Why do hardly any straight men write about sex and dating?</head>
    <body>For every date a heterosexual woman goes on there is, for better or worse, a man there. But while women produce a wide and varied literature about this experience, from dating columns to films, there is hardly any personal writing by straight men about their sex, dating and relationship lives at all. There’s Karl Ove Knausgård. But you could list women writing in this genre for hours. Nora Ephron, Anaïs Nin, bell hooks, Elizabeth Gilbert, Dolly Alderton, Candace Bushnell, and so on. Men date. Men fall in love. So where is the writing from men about these experiences? There are a few basic dating and sex advice columns aimed at straight men. Rhys Thomas writes Hey Man for Vice, Justin Myers wrote one at GQ for a while. Perhaps this is the masculine mode: anonymously ask a question, get a straight answer. Elsewhere, it feels like affairs of the heart are snuck into writing directed at straight men like vegetables into a child’s dinner. A recent New York Times article about the podcaster Scott Galloway noted that he smuggled relationship content into advice about career paths. And of course, as so many young men are doing of late, you can dive headlong into the cesspit of woman hacking, care of professed misogynist Andrew Tate. But that isn’t exactly what I had in mind. It may be that the only group of people gagging for a dating column by a straight man are the women who date them. I know that men have fascinating thoughts about their romantic lives, and I love talking to my straight male friends about it. Recently I’ve been talking to them about the difference between what a man “settling” and a woman “settling” might look like; someone’s theory that culture has massively overstated the degree to which straight men want to have sex; someone else’s that straight men are talking about a different experience when they use the term “heartbreak” than women are, and so on. When I asked them why they think the straight man relationship writing genre doesn’t exist, they were unanimously of the view that it just wouldn’t work. “I would see a dating column by a straight dude as undignified,” one said. “If it’s going well, it comes off braggy and vulgar, and if it’s going poorly, stop whinging in print.” So maybe it’s not surprising that a lot of male writers wouldn’t touch this subject with a bargepole. “Paradoxically, the sort of men who have the insight and sensitivity to write well about that experience preclude themselves from doing it exactly because of the sensitivity and awareness that would make their writing insightful,” another friend argued. There are reasons to do with the history of this particular literary form, as well. It may be that, for a number of fair reasons, women are allowed to denigrate men in print, but not the other way around. “I think some of the things I get away with saying about men would seem a bit gross from guys, because of the obvious power imbalance,” Annie Lord, British Vogue’s dating columnist, told me. Women can write about dating because on a heterosexual date, society generally accepts that women are the underdogs. Men are, in fact, talking about their sex and dating problems, but they’re not doing it in the media under their names. It’s happening anonymously on places like Reddit. A lot of this stuff is toxic garbage, yes, but plenty of it isn’t. The question may be more why no man has stepped forward to do this under his own name, in public. Do I think a trailblazing men’s dating column is going to suddenly solve the so-called crisis in male emotional communication? No. And I confess to feeling a bit sorry for straight men in this regard. I love the way women talk freely about this stuff. But not even an imagined – and it seems pretty impossible – golden age of personal writing by men is going to force straight guys into hand-holding, tear-shedding summits with their friends when the truth seems to be that, whether for societal or biological or whatever reasons, they don’t want to. Related: Dear future self: you’re never too old for love – or love letters | Elly Varrenti Would many straight men even read this fabled column? Again, I asked some friends. “I probably wouldn’t be interested in reading a column by some dude cos I’d just think, well, that’s him I guess. I can’t imagine finding it useful or applying it to me in any way.” Which made me question, what do women get out of reading dating and relationship columns? I like reading dating columns mostly because I’m nosy. But I do also think there’s something about reading other women’s experiences out there in the trenches of dating men that can feel reassuring, like talking in the “no boys allowed” treehouse. And it’s nice to go to the treehouse, so it’s sad to me that boys don’t have one of their own. Maybe some brave man will find a way to build it.

    <head>Mia Hansen-Løve: ‘I’d rather not film sex scenes than have virtue police on set’</head>
    <body>French screenwriter and director Mia Hansen-Løve, 42, was born in Paris to parents who were both philosophy professors. She studied German at university, then had stints as an actor and film critic before making her directorial debut in 2007 with All Is Forgiven. Her subsequent films include Father of My Children, Goodbye First Love, Eden and Bergman Island. Her new film, One Fine Morning, is about a single mother caring for her ailing father while embarking upon a new romance. She lives near Paris with her partner, film-maker Laurent Perreau, and their children. Related: One Fine Morning review – Mia Hansen-Løve’s moving tale of love and loss How closely was your new film, One Fine Morning, inspired by your own late father’s illness? All my films, in one way or another, use autobiographical elements. Or I should say biographical, because the majority are not inspired by my own story but those of people dear to me. But this one is probably the closest to a self-portrait. The character of Georg has the same disease my father had – a rare degenerative condition called Benson’s syndrome. When I was writing the screenplay, he was still alive and I was visiting him, like Georg’s daughter Sandra in the film. So those scenes were inspired by very fresh memories. I had the intuition that if I didn’t write about it right now, I never would. If I’d waited, I wouldn’t find the courage to turn back and look at these painful moments. But that’s only half the inspiration. The other half is a new love, the rediscovery of happiness, and how to balance those simultaneous feelings of grief and joy. You cast Pascal Greggory as Georg partly because of his physical resemblance to your father. Did that make it poignant at times during shooting? It did, actually. I’d wanted to work with Pascal for a long time because he’s a delicate, elegant, smart actor. But by chance, there is something about him that very much reminds me of my father. Sometimes it was very poignant and not just because of the physical resemblance. He also got deep into the character of my father and the nature of the disease. I recorded my father speaking and played it to Pascal. He truly seemed to understand his personality – including the way he stayed polite, even when he was losing his mind. I always found that overwhelming about my father. The last thing that he managed to preserve was his politeness. Pascal captured the feeling of who my father was. It’s an extraordinary interpretation. The most cathartic thing was turning a difficult, dark reality into something fun You wrote the role of Sandra with Léa Seydoux in mind, but wanted to strip her of glamour. Why? She’s super-sexy with incredible magnetism, but I wanted to undo that image. I aimed to portray Léa as more real and raw, so we could see deep inside her, beneath her exterior. So she wore casual clothes and had short hair. At first, she’s a very regular person, then when she falls in love and starts this passionate relationship, we rediscover her femininity. I enjoyed the idea of a mature sensuality as she rediscovers her own body. How has shooting sex scenes changed? Do you use intimacy coordinators now? No, I don’t. As long as I’m not forced to, I won’t use them. I don’t think I need it. I’m extremely sensitive and pay lots of attention to the respect that the actors need to have for one another. I’ve never had any kind of problem. I’ve never forced any actor to do anything. Everything is discussed and happens in a very smooth way. So for me, intimacy coordinators aren’t necessary. If I was forced to have some kind of virtue police on set, I’d rather not film those scenes. I understand why some people might feel reassured, but it’s very far from the experience of my own film sets. What would your father make of One Fine Morning, do you think? He never got to see it and I cannot speak for him, but I can say that he was always very encouraging of my work. Very proud, I think. My father was a philosophy teacher but I always thought he should have been a writer. He had high standards, both morally and culturally. One thing he taught was the importance of clarity. As a film-maker, I’m always looking for clarity in my style. That really mattered to him and it’s partly what made his disease so tragic, because Benson’s syndrome destroys clarity of mind. Was the process of making the film cathartic? It certainly was. It’s consoling to preserve certain memories… things that were said, moments that I might have forgotten otherwise. It’s a way of remembering who my father was before he totally disappeared. His spirit slowly dimmed and faded away, but I’m glad I could capture those last moments of light. But actually, the most cathartic thing was turning a difficult, dark reality into something fun. Even though there were times when I got very emotional, I love my job. Ultimately it’s like playing a game. A way to bring some distance. The title of my film, Un Beau Matin, is like the beginning of a fairytale. It becomes something pretend. It’s almost childish, but most directors never really want to grow up. You see that in the films of Spielberg. Directors tend to be nostalgic and want to stay children for ever. The way I found was to turn my everyday life into some kind of fun. Watch a trailer for One Fine Morning. Did it help you with your grief? My father died during Covid. That period was tough for everybody, but losing somebody in those conditions was especially horrible. Many people, including me, weren’t able to properly grieve. They weren’t allowed to see the bodies of the people they loved. They were unable to hold their hands and say goodbye. The film helped me immensely to cope with that. It was a way to feel closer to him again. How well does France support its film-makers? In general, France is very supportive with directors. We shouldn’t complain too much because there is a lot of state support. There is a strong culture of cinema here, especially arthouse cinema, but of course commercial cinema is gaining more power. There will always be a tug-of-war between that and the more independent, fragile, vulnerable arthouse films. I fear that arthouse cinema, even in France, is in danger, but it’s a national treasure we need to preserve. Your partner is a film-maker and you were previously in a relationship with director Olivier Assayas. Is it just easier to date fellow film-makers? [Laughs] I guess it’s stimulating for me to be in a couple with somebody who is also a passionate film lover. It’s not a conscious choice, it’s just happened that way. I love to have discussions, to share my doubts and fears with the person closest to me. I have faith in cinema as an art form, maybe the greatest art form. Living with somebody who has the same belief feels less lonely, you know? What’s the last film you saw? Maybe this will sound surprising, but two or three days ago I watched [1927 silent romance] Sunrise by Murnau and loved it. I cried, but I cry easily. It was very powerful emotionally and the actress [Janet Gaynor] was incredible. She had an innocence and candour that is extremely modern. Your 2014 feature, Eden, is perhaps the only good film about DJing. Do you still go out dancing? You just pointed out a very painful thing about my life! Stop it! [Laughs] No, I don’t go out dancing that much any more. I’ve moved out to Montreuil in the suburbs of Paris in order to have more space for my kids, and a garden. I’m increasingly shy when it comes to dancing. Nowadays I dance with my kids in the living room more than in nightclubs. A scene from Eden (2014) by Mia Hansen-Løve. Photograph: PR IMAGE What music are you into now? At the moment I’m listening to Handel, which probably has to do with the new film I’m working on. But Thomas Bangalter, formerly half of Daft Punk, releases a new album this week [Mythologies], so I’ll be immersing myself in that. Apparently it’s less electronic and more like contemporary classical, very different to what he’s done before. What can you tell us about the next film? I’m only in the very early stages of writing, but it’s a period film, set in England actually. Hopefully I’ll make it in the UK. I can’t say more than that; not because I’m secretive, but out of superstition. You directed Tim Roth in Bergman Island. Are there other British actors you’d love to work with? Robert Pattinson! He’s a great actor, truly. But of course, there are tons of wonderful British actors. How do you relax when you’re not working? That’s the second time that you’ve pointed something very painful about my life! I’d love to have more time to relax. We’re very busy, my boyfriend and I, working and taking care of the kids. If I had time, I would read more. To me, reading is like a holiday. I have many unread books waiting for me. • One Fine Morning is in cinemas now</body>

    <head>From Skins to Sex Education: seven of the best TV school dramas</head>
    <body>Fifteen years after Grange Hill was axed, the BBC is returning to school dramas for teen audiences with a new “Grange Hill meets The Breakfast Club” series, Phoenix Rise. Here we look at some of the best high school dramas to have gone before it. 1 Grange Hill Such an institution is this BBC programme that across its 31 series, generation after generation grew up on its hard-hitting storylines that ranged from heroin addiction to sexual assault. It spawned Top 10 singles (Just Say No!), drew peak audiences of 12 million young viewers, and brought a gritty realism to youth programming the likes of which had never been seen before. 2 Freaks and Geeks Judd Apatow and Paul Feig’s tale of high school outcasts was so beautifully observed and subtly plotted that it became a cult classic, and it served as an incubator for the next generation of US talent. Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jason Segel and Busy Philipps all cut their teeth in this clever, moving and frequently hilarious series. 3 The OC This soapy tale of wealthy California teens was one of the biggest pop culture phenomena of the early 00s – and with good reason. Seth Cohen’s dry wit launched a thousand preppy jumper purchases, and it was almost impossible not to love the hyperactive, often sarcastic tone with which this show undercut the relationship dramas of its rich characters. The fact that it was all set in a sun-kissed landscape full of beautiful people and palatial homes didn’t hurt. 4 Skins A reputation for sex, drugs and nu-rave often overshadowed the real appeal of this teen drama: a flair for well-rounded characters living out genuinely believable teen lives. A cast full of future luminaries such as Nicholas Hoult and Dev Patel gave real heft to a script that veered between tragedy and gleeful, adolescent joie de vivre – ie what it’s actually like to be a teenager. 5 Euphoria There’s a good reason why no fewer than nine Emmys have been showered on this controversy-packed Gen Z teen drama. Partly, it’s that Zendaya’s turn as the recovering heroin addict Rue is one of the most compelling TV performances in years. But, more than that, this HBO series brings something to high school dramas that has long been missing from the genre: an unflinching, warts-and-all take on teen life that’s irresistibly watchable, no matter your age. 6 Heartstopper When it comes to quietly revolutionary takes on high school dramas, nothing holds a candle to Alice Oseman’s tale of gay, male love in a British grammar school. It’s an utterly lovely tale of sexuality as a spectrum, and such an unrivalled insight into the emotional literacy of today’s teens that it thrums with a feeling of nowness. 7 Sex Education It takes an uncommonly good school-based series to lure an actor of Gillian Anderson’s calibre. Viewers of this stylish series about a teenage wannabe sex therapist may have come for the salacious carnal hijinks, but they’ve stayed for a show whose impeccably acted episodes veer from laugh-out-loud funny to lump-in-the-throat moving.</body>

    <head>Church of England votes in favour of blessings for same-sex unions</head>
    <body>Church of England priests will be permitted to bless the civil marriages of same-sex couples in a profound shift in the church’s stance on homosexuality after a historic vote by its governing body. The first blessings for gay couples could happen this summer. Individual churches will be encouraged to state clearly whether they will offer blessings to avoid confusion and disappointment. After an impassioned debate lasting more than eight hours, the C of E’s national assembly, the General Synod, voted by 250 votes to 181 to back a proposal by bishops intended to end years of painful divisions and disagreement over sexuality. But emotionally charged speeches from those advocating full equality for LGBTQ+ Christians and those arguing that traditional biblical teaching on marriage and sex must be upheld signalled that the debate is set to continue. The synod also agreed that the church will apologise for the harm it has caused to LGBTQ+ people. It welcomed a forthcoming review of a ban on clergy entering into same-sex civil marriages and a celibacy rule for clergy in same-sex relationships. Conservatives narrowly succeeded in amending the motion to state that the church’s doctrine of marriage – that it is between a man and a woman – was unchanged. Although progressives were dismayed by the amendment, it may have encouraged some traditionalists to cast their votes in favour of the main motion. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, and Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, said they hoped the decision marked a “new beginning” for the C of E, saying: “It has been a long road to get us to this point.” The archbishops said: “For the first time, the C of E will publicly, unreservedly and joyfully welcome same-sex couples in church. “The church continues to have deep differences on these questions which go to the heart of our human identity. As archbishops, we are committed to respecting the conscience of those for whom this goes too far and to ensure that they have all the reassurances they need in order to maintain the unity of the church as this conversation continues.” Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, who led the debate, said: “This is a moment of hope for the church.” But, she added,“I know that what we have proposed as a way forward does not go nearly far enough for many, but too far for others”. Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, who supports marriage equality, said the vote was a “significant and historic step”. He said: “Same-sex couples will become much more visible and their relationships will be celebrated publicly and that, I think, will continue to change attitudes within the life of the church.” The amendment on marriage doctrine was “important to give some reassurance to those who are more conservative”, he said, but it would not stop the church “returning to this question [of same-sex marriage]” in the future. Gay rights campaigners were frustrated that their demand that a proposal for marriage equality be put before the synod within two years was rejected by 52% to 45%. Jayne Ozanne, a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ equality in the C of E, said allowing blessings for same-sex couples was a “tiny step forward”. She added: “I am deeply disappointed by the way the conservatives have consistently sought to undermine those of us who sought to move towards a church that could embrace a plurality of views on sexuality.” Nigel Pietroni, the chair of the Campaign for Equal Marriage in the C of E, said the decision “falls short of what we ultimately believe is the only outcome for radical inclusion – equal marriage for all people”, but it was “a small step forward”. The gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: “The offer of blessings to same-sex partners is an insult. Every heterosexual man and woman in England has the right to marry in their parish church - but not LGBTQ+ couples. That’s discrimination and discrimination is not a Christian value.” On the other side of the argument, the Church of England Evangelical Council said it was “deeply saddened” by the decision, which it saw as setting the church on a course of action that rejected “our historic and biblical understanding of sex and marriage”. The vote had “settled nothing and has only served to deepen divisions”, the association said. The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches said the decision raised the question of the archbishop of Canterbury’s “fitness to lead what is still a largely orthodox worldwide communion”. The synod debate was procedurally complex, with more than two dozen amendments to the bishops’ motion. Some were efforts to delay the plans, arguing that more time was needed to consider the issues despite several years of consultations over sexuality. All but one of the amendments were rejected, sometimes narrowly, or withdrawn.</body>

    <head>‘The all-consuming orgasm’: how erotic thriller Obsession takes sex to the next level</head>
    <body>From everyone who has made the Netflix series Obsession – the writer, Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, the leads, Richard Armitage and Charlie “Happy Valley” Murphy – I want to know the following: when did they read the book on which it is based, Damage, by Josephine Hart; have they seen the film, starring Juliette Binoche and Jeremy Irons; and did they spend the whole early 90s talking about it? Lloyd Malcolm loves the book and has never seen the film. Neither appeared on Armitage’s radar at the time. And Murphy, well, she was only three when it was published in 1991. Damage was the 50 Shades of its day – propulsive, original and extremely widely read. It had a similar lightning-rod impact to 50 Shades, as a breezy, middlebrow way in to quite a big conversation about sex. The plot centres on a respected surgeon – a rounded, well-liked man, yada yada – who meets his son’s girlfriend and immediately starts having an affair with her, with appalling consequences. It was distinctly of its time: a world still suffused with HIV anxiety, trying to build back taboos around sexual transgression that previous decades had destroyed with their permissiveness, by creating situations so unforgivable, and imagining punishments so radically disproportionate, that somehow Old Testament values might be restored. Think Fatal Attraction, remove the boiled rabbit, and still the consequences for the surgeon are way worse. It always felt to me like the fever dream of the wronged wife, awake at 4am, trying to think of the worst possible person her husband could be having an affair with, then the direst imaginable comeuppance. Lloyd Malcolm agrees, carefully: “I don’t want to speak too much on what Josephine intended because she’s not around to defend anything any more. But I do feel like this is one of her more personal books, and she was working through a lot.” Hart died in 2011, happily married to Maurice Saatchi, but her previous marriage – well, it wasn’t quite so successful. Tapped up … Charlie Murphy as Anna and Richard Armitage as William in Obsession. Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/Netflix The thrust of Obsession is broadly as Armitage describes: “Has anybody ever stepped into your life who has given you that sense of overwhelming, indescribable physical obsession? If they have, did you end up in a relationship with them or did you choose to walk away? If they haven’t, I pity you. Because everyone should feel that.” But as Lloyd Malcolm says, “The book is so particular about the kind of sex they’re having and the way they do it and how that feeds into their relationship.” That’s a dominant-submissive relationship, which the original film didn’t have a clue what to do with. Louis Malle, the director, swapped out all the momentum and subversiveness of the BDSM dynamic for a broad-brush sexual urgency that relied pretty heavily on the magnetism of Jeremy Irons. Obsession has sought to restore that. “It was really important to me to not be saying anything like: ‘BDSM sex is bad sex,’” says Lloyd Malcolm. Yet it has to be quite a vanilla version of kink, because it’s mainstream TV – much like the film of 50 Shades, in fact, it’s a lot of ribbon and restraint and blindfolding, unlike “the porn version of things”, Lloyd Malcolm says, “which would be very intense, very dark, lots of leather. There’s a certain kind of costume that you’re expecting.” Representing BDSM with Japanese silk ropes is almost metaphorical; it’s such a niche part of the kink. It works because this is not a how-to, but ultimately about their relationship and “who is in control of it”, says Lloyd Malcolm. “For me, it was always Anna [the girlfriend]. Every single scenario. These two aliens from another planet have found each other and they both have this need in them that they can meet in each other.” From the moment the two meet, Charlie Murphy says, “she is completely in control. This is physically her world. She is the architect of every single rule. She is the dominant submissive, and the power she gives to him is a very cathartic experience for her.” It’s probably only now, when intimacy coaches on set are routine, that you could even make a drama in which the sex is a driving part of the plot, rather than something decorative. Armitage describes the before-world with comic haplessness: “The director would say: ‘I’ll put the camera on. I won’t call cut, you just do your thing.’ They’d close the set and then they’d leave. So then you have to do all of that work with your scene partner. You’re like: OK, what are we gonna do? We can’t have sex because that’s a whole other industry, that’s porn. Some people did as a badge of honour, I just really disliked that. In the same way that when I climbed over a table and glued a man on to a wheelchair and bit his face off in Hannibal, I wanted some choreography. They’d never do a fight scene by saying: ‘Just punch each other. Just beat each other up.’” Besides, as Murphy says: “I don’t want to draw on my own sexual experience. I want to feel like I’m coming at it from Anna’s perspective, and feel protected by that.” Murphy was filming this simultaneously with the celebrated third season of Happy Valley, and while she didn’t choose it deliberately as a counterpoint, the characters could not be more different if she had, and there are obvious career upsides: “There might be opportunities outside police force work now,” she says drily. She is, of course, Ann Gallagher, the kidnap victim turned plucky police recruit; resilient, wholesome everywoman. The roles are pretty different. Culture has also done a bit of work on itself in terms of gaze: is it always a male gaze? Is the male character more fully drawn? Can you even figure out what the female character is playing at, or is she too beautiful to need a motivation? This was a massive flaw in the book, which is entirely told from the perspective of the surgeon. Books are allowed to have narrators and some of them have to be male, but Anna is “such a slight version of herself, she’s almost this spectre that slips into the family and blows everything up,” says Lloyd Malcolm. “I wanted to make sure we filled her out more, understood her more. That doesn’t mean we have to like her and all the things she does. I mean, I ended up with a huge amount of love for her. I just wanted to give her a massive hug.” The script has without question stepped up to fix the deficiencies of the book, but it’s testament to Murphy’s incredible screen presence that you find yourself allying with her ages before her backstory emerges to give you any good reason to. Armitage, too, hands in a remarkably convincing performance as dominant; in real life he’s very submissive. If he starts on a thought and decides not to follow through, you just have to tell him to, then he does. For instance: “Some people will watch this and think: ‘I hope to God that person never walks into my field of vision.’ And some people will feel like: ‘I want to feel that.’ It’s a bit like … oh, I’d better not go there.” “You have to.” “Well, I’m sure there are people in the world who have never had an all-consuming orgasm. You’re missing a large part of being human.” Knotty affair … A scene from Obsession. Photograph: Ana Blumenkron But if TV has largely evolved so female characters can’t be ciphers any more, and kink doesn’t have to be etched out of a plot to which it is actually central, there is also more contention around BDSM, more people who would challenge it as a legitimate preference and say that it’s women internalising male violence. “I don’t think we’re ever going to get to a point of consensus around it,” says Lloyd Malcolm. “What I hope we’ve done is show a relationship that is, in essence, destructive, but that’s not related to the kind of sex they’re having.” “It’s not even gender reversal, where she’s calling the shots and giving him the permission to dominate her,” says Armitage. “It’s beyond that: a push and pull between two adults, exploring what their kinks are. He doesn’t even know, and that’s part of the attraction. It’s not about props. It’s about freedom.” Murphy calls Armitage’s character a frog in the water, “slowly boiling, until there’s no getting out of it”. Of her own, she says: “I like to think of her as ink. Anything she touches, anything she’s been around, there’s this bleed of her, this inkiness. That’s the kind of substance she is.” The funny thing is, the whole show retains the appeal of the original 90s morality sex fable, which is an intense melodrama, with baroque detailing, the sense of an authorial subconscious gaping open, and the central question: what’s the worst that could happen if you let your appetites overwhelm you? You unleash the apocalypse, idiot! It’s just that it took another 30 years before the screen could shed its squeamishness and try to tell it. Obsession is on Netflix on 13 April.</body>

    <head>Mordaunt calls on Church of England to allow same-sex marriages</head>
    <body>The leader of the House of Commons has urged Church of England bishops to back same-sex marriage in critical talks this week, saying the church’s current stance causes “pain and trauma” to LGBTQ+ people. Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth who chairs the privy council, has written to her local bishop saying: “I hope you will back reform, allowing parishes and clergy to conduct weddings for same-sex couples or, at a minimum, enable authorised blessings.” The bishops have an all-day meeting on Tuesday at which they will decide on a recommended outcome to be put before the C of E’s parliament, the General Synod, which meets next month. Mordaunt’s letter adds pressure on the C of E to change its stance, based on biblical teaching, to reflect the law of the land and the weight of public opinions. LGBTQ+ members of the C of E says its refusal so far to treat them equally is institutional homophobia. Mordaunt says in her letter: “It is some time now since parliament legislated for civil partnerships and then same-sex marriage. Since then both the Episcopal Church in Scotland and the Church of Scotland have agreed to offer same-sex marriage, and the Church in Wales plans to do so soon. “I fear that if [the issue] is not resolved at next month’s General Synod, the matter will continue to fester and detract from the positive contribution the Church of England makes to our society. “It is also important to recognise the pain and trauma that this continues to cause many LGBT+ people who are left feeling that they are treated as second-class citizens within our society.” Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter and former Labour cabinet minister, said Mordaunt’s letter reflected strong views among MPs from all parties who wanted to see change in the C of E. “It is unsustainable for the state church to be out of sync not only with the society it aspires to serve, but also its sister churches in Scotland and Wales,” he said. Alicia Kearns, the Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, and Peter Gibson, the Tory MP for Darlington, are among those who have urged the C of E to change its stance. The bishops’ meeting on Tuesday follows two sessions in the autumn to decide on a recommendation on the issue that has caused bitter divisions within the church for decades. They are thought to be considering a number of options, ranging from the status quo – that the bible proclaims marriage to be a union of a man and a woman – to full marriage equality for same-sex couples. Both are unlikely outcomes. In between, are options for a “conscience clause” for clergy, allowing those opposed to same-sex marriage to opt out, and permitting clergy to bless the civil marriages of same-sex couples. They may also recommend lifting the ban on clergy marrying same-sex partners, and the insistence on celibacy for clergy in same-sex civil relationships. A person familiar with the bishops’ discussions said: “The weight of opinion is for change, but final discussions will be over the level of change.” There have been calls for parliamentary intervention if the C of E – the national church – fails to move towards the law and public opinion. Bradshaw said: “If the church can’t do this itself, its exemption from the law as allowed under the Equality Act needs to be removed by parliament.” Tony Baldry, a former Conservative MP, government minister and Second Church Estates Commissioner, said last week: “I have little doubt that if the church cannot find a way forward that enables clergy either to marry same-sex couples or to bless their weddings, MPs will soon feel the need to intervene.” Polling carried out last year for the Ozanne Foundation, which campaigns for equality, found that 55% of people in England who identify as Anglican believe same-sex marriage is “right”. Younger people are more likely to share this view. Just 29% think it is “wrong”.</body>

    <head>Will Trent review – the detective’s punched someone and had sex before the first episode’s finished</head>
    <body>Detective shows need to have at least one of two things: clever plots to confound us, or a world we want to live in. If the mystery is a doozy, a personality-free investigator isn’t always a dealbreaker. If you’re enjoying spending time with the sleuths, whodunnit doesn’t necessarily matter. Will Trent, a breezy escape of a cop show, is in the second category. We’re in Atlanta, Georgia, where sunshine streams dustily through windows, old soul music is always playing somewhere within your earshot and people talk to each other with a terse, fuss-averse wit. While the regular Atlanta police department do their best to solve major crimes, their vibe is constantly ruined by the fancy know-it-alls from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, swanning in to hoover up all the good cases. One of the GBI’s number, Will Trent (Ramón Rodríguez), enjoys his own level of unpopularity, having recently busted a load of APD officers for corruption – that’s why he has “Rat Snitch Traitor” scrawled in graffiti on the side of his car, Alan Partridge-style. But here he is, walking, almost floating, into the scene of a double homicide. Before the opening credits we saw Abigail (Jennifer Morrison), upset by the realisation that her car-dealer husband Paul (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) had cheated on her, arrive home from a tennis lesson to find a broken window, the front door open and a knife-wielding youth standing over her daughter Emma’s dead body. In the ensuing tussle, Abigail killed the knife-wielding youth. The regular cop on the scene may have come up with a memorable description of Abigail (“Rich white lady, 100 pounds soaking wet, probably carries her intestines around in a purse”) but he has the case all wrong. Trent immaculately deduces via a combination of observation and intuition: that’s not Emma, it’s her friend; the dead kid with a knife isn’t a killer, he’s a second victim; Emma is missing because she has been abducted. Once Will is partnered with a very reluctant APD detective, Faith (Iantha Richardson), the hunt for Emma is on and, for home gumshoes who watch their crime shows leaning forward, tongue out, notepad and pen on knee, it’s all a bit basic. Everyone Will and Faith meet turns out to be helpful or guilty, the source of a big breakthrough that is far too easy for the cops to work out: Will is meant to be an annoying genius along the lines of Sherlock or House – appropriately, given the guest role by Morrison, who spent eight years on the show – but clues keep falling neatly into his hands. There’s no need to wonder who a new piece of evidence incriminates: it’s always the person Will and Faith spoke to last. And yet, this is not a problem. Faith’s withering assessment of her new colleague is a gas (“You alienate people. With your three-piece suit and your little handkerchief and your terrible personality”), but her description of Will isn’t entirely accurate: his personality is its own tasty riddle. He is severely dyslexic and the way this struggle is also a strength is redolent of perhaps his most obvious influence, Adrian Monk from Monk. But he’s not defined by the condition. He carries the scars of his abusive upbringing in the foster-care system, but he’s not consumed by darkness and psychological damage. And despite his fussy attire, commitment to excellence and tendency towards verbal directness, he’s no stiff ascetic: before episode one is done, he has punched someone and had sex with someone else. Rodríguez’s offhand charisma turns Will – originally created by novelist Karin Slaughter for a series of her bestsellers – into a character where the lack of a defining characteristic is a plus. He’s quirky as hell but not in a way that stops him being a relatable human, as evidenced by his second believable relationship with a woman: Angie Polaski (Erika Christensen), a fellow survivor of children’s homes and a recovering addict who enjoys going undercover with drug dealers a little too much. “We don’t date,” says this tousled renegade of her on/off courtship with Will. “We scurry around in the shadows and wallow in shame.” Their joshing, self-deprecating affection, a love borne of, and potentially ruined by, their shared traumatic past looks to be the show’s beating, bruised heart. By the time poor Emma has been rescued, Will’s unconventional support network has been constructed – Sonja Sohn is good too as his pragmatic boss Amanda, a character who feels primed for further development – and he’s ready to solve unlimited numbers of crimes in his own special way. Would it be good if those crimes were a bit better plotted? Yes, but in the meantime, we’re happy just hanging with Will’s gang. • Will Trent is on Disney+</body>

    <body>Storyville: Sex on Screen 10pm, BBC Four In this terrific documentary women talk about how sex in the movies has changed up to and beyond the #MeToo movement. The interviewees include the first Black “Bond girl”, Gloria Hendry, and Janet Leigh’s Psycho body double Marli Renfro, who says she got zero credit. It covers the mid-20th century change in Hollywood censorship from “romance without sex” to “sex without romance”, Jane Fonda getting drunk to shoot the nude sequence in Barbarella, and today’s world of airbrushed bodies, fake pubic hairpieces and intimacy coordinators. Hollie Richardson Great British Menu 8pm, BBC Two Who will make it through this week’s Scottish heats? Keeping kitchen temperatures high are Adam Handling of Michelin-starred restaurant Frog; Mark McCabe, owner of the Ethicurean; Kevin Dalgleish, head chef of Amuse in Aberdeen; and Tunde “Abi” Abifarin, head chef at Edinburgh’s Farin Road. HR Food Unwrapped Gets Fruity 8pm, Channel 4 The Unwrapped team cheerfully investigate a bunch of fructose-rich mysteries. Spain provides an answer as to why some oranges are difficult to peel, while India is the venue for a test of pomegranate’s mooted health-boosting properties.

    <head>A message to the NHS: disabled people like having sex, too</head>
    <body>“It’s like they think we don’t have sex at all,” I complained down the phone to my friend, as I boarded the bus to go home from a sexual health checkup in which I’d been reminded, many times, that the service didn’t cater to the needs of people such as me. Ready to give my mate the full account of what had happened, I realised that maybe my fellow passengers didn’t want to be subjected to this story. So I reluctantly said my goodbyes, sat down and gathered my thoughts. From the moment I called to make the appointment to the second I left the building, I was reminded, drip by drip, how sexual healthcare in this country is at best unwelcoming to disabled people, and at worst completely inaccessible. I just wanted the usual MOT – which we should all be getting routinely if we are sexually active – but even that proved troublesome. When I walked into the clinic for my appointment, I stood in front of a reception desk so high I couldn’t see the three people behind it (and, as I’m 4ft tall, they certainly couldn’t see me). We had a brief and very awkward exchange, before I was ushered into a waiting room where the chairs were too high for me to mount, so I had to stand. I was given a form with tiny printed text that asked me all manner of personal questions, excluding a very important one: whether I had access needs. In fact, at no point, from the initial phone call to the appointment itself, was I asked about my access needs. In the patient room, I was asked to lie down on a bed that was too high for me; the stirrups didn’t fit my legs so I couldn’t use them; and clinicians couldn’t find my cervix (lots of people with dwarfism, and many without, have tilted cervixes – it’s a thing). Some of those things are inconvenient and uncomfortable; some are major access barriers. All together, they can make you feel like giving up and going home. Speaking up and pushing for better access, which places the onus on disabled people and not the people in charge of the inaccessible environment around us, can feel overwhelming and awkward – particularly in the context of sexual health. Mine is not an isolated story, and it’s not the worst-case scenario, either. I was able to get what I needed, albeit in an undignified fashion. Others aren’t so lucky. I asked other disabled peopleto share their experiences, and this is what they told me. One person told me that the sexual health clinic at their local hospital runs a walk-in service that’s located up three flights of stairs with no easily accessible lift. Imogen Fox, a queer disabled femme, told me that when they visited a sexual health clinic, the tests they needed couldn’t be carried out because there was no hoist to move them from their wheelchair to the bed. Someone else said they had to phone up to ask accessibility questions before booking their appointment, but phoning being the only option is an access issue in itself for those who are deaf or have neurological disabilities. Another talked about having to wait months for a home visit appointment because they couldn’t leave the house; a lengthy waiting time like this is risky if you have an infection that needs treatment. “It took three years from receiving my cervical screening invitation to actually being able to have it,” says Lorraine Stanley, CEO of Sex With a Difference (SWAD), an organisation dedicated to improving access to sexual healthcare for disabled people in the UK. The delay was caused due to a lack of examination tables with appropriate leg supports and handles. “Luckily, my results were clear, but if there had been cancerous cells present, the delay could have resulted in my having to have a more invasive treatment.” Disabled people are painfully aware of the accessibility barriers we face in healthcare at large. In the context of sexual health, these barriers feel somehow heavier to me; society often treats us as though we’re not deserving of sexual experiences, and/or that we simply can’t have them. Inaccessibility to sexual health only reinforces these stereotypes. Hannah Barham-Brown, who is a GP registrar and wheelchair user, agrees. She told me that due to services being under huge strain, “it is inevitable that as human beings, staff will fall back on assumptions to speed up care provision – but this is liable to disproportionately impact disabled people, who may be assumed not to be sexually active at all.” Later that day, I called my friend back and shared what had happened. They replied with sympathy, then added: “But the NHS is on its knees.” They’re right, of course. Nevertheless, it’s unfair, and oftentimes dangerous, that disabled people should yet again have to bear the brunt of the Tory government’s chronic NHS underfunding. We deserve opportunities to explore sex – and we deserve access to sexual healthcare, too. Cathy Reay is a freelance writer covering disability and relationships</body>

    <head>Sandi Toksvig to meet Archbishop of Canterbury over same-sex marriage</head>
    <body>Sandi Toksvig has said she will be meeting the archbishop of Canterbury for coffee, after bishops this week refused to back gay marriage but said civil partnerships could be blessed in church. “Quick update – I will be meeting the Archbishop of Canterbury for a long promised coffee next week,” the broadcaster and author, who is gay, tweeted on Saturday. Quick update - I will be meeting the Archbishop of Canterbury for a long promised coffee next week. — Sandi Toksvig (@sanditoksvig) January 21, 2023 The Church of England on Wednesday shared a public apology from its bishops “for the ways in which the Church of England has treated LGBTQI+ people”. Related: Justin Welby ‘joyful’ at C of E switch but will not bless same-sex civil marriages The Church of England also outlined plans to bless same-sex couples who are legally married, which will be up for debate at the General Synod. However, same-sex couples still cannot marry in the church and blessings for civil gay marriages will be on a voluntary basis for clergy. The church will not change its stance that marriage is solely between a man and a woman. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said he was “extremely joyful” at the church’s change of stance. However, Welby said he had pastoral responsibility for the global Anglican church and would not personally bless same-sex marriages “in order not to compromise that pastoral care”. A meeting between Toksvig and Welby had long been in the works. Toksvig – who hosted shows such as QI and The Great British Bake Off – shared an open letter to Welby in August after he reaffirmed a 1998 resolution that gay sex is sinful. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said he will not personally bless civil same-sex marriages. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA “Seriously, with the state the world is in, that is what you wanted to focus on?” she wrote. “You didn’t have other more pressing matters like, I don’t know, war or poverty?” “This is a serious matter,” she continued. “The lives of LGBTQ+ people are at stake here. “I have had several credible death threats over the years sometimes requiring the very kind assistance of the police hate crime squad. Each and every one of those threats has come from an evangelical Christian. “Call me, Justin,” Toksvig wrote in closing. “Let’s have coffee. Let me talk you round. You never know, I might even forgive you.” Welby responded with an open letter of his own, saying he “would love to sit down over coffee and talk” with Toksvig. “The hatred and threats that you – and so many other LGBTQI+ people – have experienced in the name of Jesus Christ are a sin,” the archbishop wrote. “I have absolutely no doubt about that and want to be in no doubt of my position. The Church of England agrees with this view and vigorously opposes conversion therapy. “There is much more to say about Christianity being based and founded and lived in love, and we can talk about that more in depth later.”</body>

    <head>Share a bath, play the three-minute game and don’t catastrophise! How to have better sex</head>
    <body>There’s an irony – or maybe not – in the fact that since we’ve become more “open” about sex as a society, we’ve been having less of it. So sex is everywhere, but not so much in the nation’s bedrooms (or sitting room floors, or on the kitchen worktops or wherever else you might care to get down to it). The generation that had most sex was born in the 1930s – the so-called silent generation; the generations that have it least are millennials, born between 1981 and 1996 and Gen Z who are born between 1997 and 2012. In Britain, across all age groups, around one in four of us has sex at least once in an average week with almost one in 10 of us managing three times – but the older we are, the less common sex is. The average age someone loses their virginity is 17, with late twentysomethings having the most sex. But by our late 30s, four in 10 report having not had sex in the past week, and around a fifth of 40 to 44-year-olds aren’t having sex at all. What, though, is a sex life? You might not currently have a partner, but you’re experimenting, solo or not. And sex certainly isn’t just about penetration: sex is intimacy that involves touch, stimulation, oral sex, masturbation. Yourself and, if you have one, your partner. But whatever kind of sexual activity you’re engaged in – solo, straight, queer or bi – stress is a barrier. Research published last month found the lifestyle demands on women aged 40-59 were more significant than the menopause in the decline and frequency of sexual activity. So how do we do it better? Here’s advice for some of the trickiest moments in our sex lives. … if it’s the first time Penetrative sex – the insertion of part of your body into part of someone else’s, or vice versa – isn’t something to “get over with”. You’re much more likely to have a good time if you take the opposite approach. Remember, it’s the first time – it doesn’t have to be the best time. You’re on the nursery slopes. Relationship and psychosexual therapist Cate Campbell suggests concentrating on non-penetrative sex for a while first. “Seeing an aroused penis for the first time can be a shock,” she says. If you’re a heterosexual woman, “use his penis to stimulate your clitoris – get used to having it around your vulva”. If you’re a homosexual man, be aware that getting a hard-on doesn’t mean your partner necessarily wants penetrative sex. Make sure you talk; and it goes for all sexual situations, that both partners must totally consent to whatever is happening or about to happen. If you’re going to be penetrated by another person’s penis, it’s definitely a good idea to start by spending time with it before you have it inside you: hold it, play with it, perhaps start with just a bit of penetration, so you can feel how it’s going to be. Talk with your partner beforehand: in a heterosexual relationship, having the girl on top will also help to ensure she stays in control. “What you want is that the first time you have penetrative sex, you already have a lot of arousal,” says Campbell. And if you’re the girl, don’t expect to climax; most women don’t orgasm during penetration. And if you’re the boy, don’t fret about whether you’ll come too quickly. The ambition is to enjoy yourselves, without pressures. … at the start of a big relationship Sex tends to be great at the start of a big relationship – but what matters here is being authentic and honest right from the get-go. “If you do what you think your partner wants, rather than what you want, you could be setting yourself up for resentment down the line,” cautions Relate psychosexual therapist Tamara Hoyton. So listen to your partner: ask what he/she wants, and share what you truly want. “Using terms like ‘I like it when you …’ or ‘I love it when …’ is important,” she says. “No one is a mind reader.” What’s really sexy for anyone, in any kind of relationship, is being with a partner who’s confident in their own mind, who’s prepared to be upfront about what they want. So don’t be shy: and enjoy it. … if it’s a one-night stand Perhaps fuelled by internet dating, one night stands are on the up, especially among older people. A study from King’s College London this month found Britons are more likely than people elsewhere to have casual sex, with four in 10 saying it’s justifiable. That rises to 67% of Gen Z respondents, and 30% of baby boomers (up from 8% in 2009). Context and self-knowledge are all when it comes to casual sex. Don’t do it if you’ve had way too much to drink. “And also, you need to know yourself well enough to know you’re not going to hate yourself in the morning,” says Hoyton. If you’re embarking on this, with a positive frame of mind, the trick is to be creative. “Think about doing something different,” says Hoyton. “And if you’re going to do it, make sure you enjoy it.” To enjoy it, you’ll need to be clear about what you like and dislike: think about how adventurous you want to be, and dare to try something new. This kind of sex will all be about what happens in the moment: your partner doesn’t know you. Be bold! Have fun! Experiment, and find out new things about yourself. … when you’ve been with the same person for 23 years Desire and arousal are different things, says Campbell, and understanding this helps in understanding sex in a long-term relationship. “Most women in these relationships, and about a third of men, don’t feel desire until after they feel aroused,” she says. So concentrate on giving yourselves the opportunity for desire to develop. “You might want to have a bath together, or just go to bed naked together,” she says. Or try the three-minute game, which focuses on touch and telling one another how you’d like to both give and receive touch. Take the pressure off by agreeing beforehand that it’s not going to be a failure if penetrative sex doesn’t happen; this is about connecting, or reconnecting. It’s not about all or nothing, and if you’ve not been having sex much for a while, you need to invest time if you want to be intimate again. Talking about your fantasies is another great way to get sex going again, says Campbell. In long-term relationships (but in less long term ones as well), it’s often the case that one partner is more keen on sex than the other. In fact, says Hoyton, this is always the case, because who has identical desires? It’s always about accommodating the other person; but if your partner doesn’t want sex at all or hardly ever (and don’t assume it’s going to be the woman who feels like this in a heterosexual relationship; men in midlife are every bit as likely to be under stress and feeling sex is something they can take off their long to-do list), working things out can be tough. Empathy is all. Try to understand why your partner isn’t into sex. Try to keep the avenues of physical connection open: offer cuddles without the implication that sex will necessarily follow. Think about the ways in which you and your partner are intimate: if you’ve been together a long time, intimacy can come in different forms. Remember, too, says Hoyton, that sex in a long-term relationship is rarely spontaneous: you need to diarise it, you need to plan for it. … after you have given birth This is another time when the big message is to go slow, and make sure your partner knows why you need him to go slow. “Your vagina is possibly going to feel different after you’ve had a baby,” says Hoyton. “It might be dryer, or you might experience some pain. Only have penetrative sex when you feel really ready to do that.” Hormonal changes affect lubrication, so have a lubricant on standby. And as always, don’t worry about it all going perfectly. “Sometimes you have good sex, sometimes you have bad sex,” says Hoyton. “The quality of the sex you have today doesn’t dictate the quality of the sex you might have tomorrow.” Try not to catastrophise around sex: sometimes it works well, sometimes it doesn’t work so well. When you’ve just had a baby, there are all sorts of other things going on, so don’t stress about sex and ease yourself back into it as slowly as you want. … if you’ve never had an orgasm Anorgasmia, which is a persistent difficulty in achieving orgasm, more common in women but sometimes a problem for men – is a medical condition that can be treated very successfully, so talk to your GP. But for most people, not having an orgasm is more about the psychological pressure. “Sex tends to be very goal-oriented,” says Hoyton. “If people don’t have an orgasm, they feel cheated. And men often judge their performance on whether they get a woman to climax – it’s a standard of his prowess.” Tantra teacher and sex and intimacy coach Jan Day recommends spending time in self-pleasuring. “Take time. Discover what feels good. Let yourself know it’s OK to feel pleasure,” she says. “Learn to pleasure yourself on your clitoris and around your labia, and gradually pleasure and stroke the inside of your vagina – there’s usually a spot there that feels different.” Remember too, she says, that having an orgasm is about everything in your life: learn to enjoy your body, and then tell your partner what you like. And don’t feel it has to be him who brings you to orgasm; masturbating during sex with a partner can help you to come more easily, and will help him to see what you like. … when you hit the menopause Here’s one thing to get straight: hitting the menopause doesn’t mean you don’t feel like sex any more. “In fact it’s not until 12 years after the menopause that there’s any significant loss of libido,” says Campbell. Given that the average age of menopause in the UK is 51, that means women can expect to get into their early 60s without any change to their sex drive. You will, however, notice differences: for example, you don’t feel horny mid-month any more, because you’re no longer ovulating. But that doesn’t mean you’re not going to feel like sex at all. The menopause militates against sex more in terms of how it makes a woman feel: too hot, too sweaty, unsure when you’re suddenly going to have a heavy period. What women tend to do, says Campbell, is tell their man not to come near them – they’re not feeling good. What she suggests is go with it: have a break from sex, but talk with your partner about what is possible. “It might be sitting on the sofa holding hands; it might be mutual masturbation.” The important thing is to be honest about how you’re feeling, and look for what is acceptable and possible and will make you feel good.</body>

    <head>Anglicans angry at same-sex blessings question Justin Welby’s ‘fitness to lead’</head>
    <body>Conservative Anglican churches in developing countries will meet next week to consider radical action over the Church of England’s decision to bless same-sex couples in civil marriages, saying they question the archbishop of Canterbury’s “fitness to lead” the global church. The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA), which represents churches in 24 countries and provinces including Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, said the C of E’s new stance “goes against the overwhelming mind of the Anglican Communion”. The “reality” of the C of E’s decision was a rejection of the doctrine that marriage is the lifelong union of a man and a woman, it added. On Monday a dozen key church leaders from the global south are expected to consider moves to take a dominant position in the Anglican Communion, relegating Justin Welby, who as archbishop of Canterbury heads up the global church of 85 million people, to a marginal role. In an effort to prevent an irreparable breakdown, Welby has said he personally will not bless same-sex marriages. But conservative church leaders have warned of profound repercussions after the historic vote by the C of E’s governing body, the General Synod, on Thursday. Samy Fawzy Shehata, the archbishop of Alexandria in Egypt, told the synod that “crossing this line of blessing same-sex unions will alienate 75% of the Anglican Communion” and “lead eventually to impaired and broken communion”. He urged the C of E to not “surrender your unique position as the mother church of the Anglican Communion.” Stephen Kaziimba, the archbishop of Uganda, said in a statement on Friday: “God cannot bless what he calls sin. The C of E has departed from the Anglican faith and are now false teachers.” Ahead of the synod vote, archbishop Justin Badi Arama, the head of the Anglican church in South Sudan, said Welby was “failing to defend biblical truth”, and his role as moral leader of the global church had been “severely jeopardised”. Henry Ndukuba, the primate of the massive Nigerian church, was due to meet his bishops on Friday to discuss their response. Gafcon, a coalition of conservative churches, said the C of E had “authorised the blessing of sin” and was “moving a step at a time to fully accept the practice of homosexuality as part of the life and the practice of the English church”. The GSFA, which claims to represent 75% of the global Anglican church, said it would take “decisive steps towards resetting the Anglican Communion”. Its members would not leave the global church but “with great sadness must recognise that the C of E has now joined those provinces with which communion is impaired”. Conservative churches have already broken off relations with churches in the US, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales, which offer church weddings to same-sex couples or bless their civil marriages. During the synod debate, Folli Olokose, a Nigerian-born vicar in the diocese of Guildford, said a vote in favour of blessing same-sex unions would be “putting a nail in the coffin of the Anglican Communion”. Martin Warner, the bishop of Chichester, warned that equal marriage would “undermine trust within the Anglican Communion and be seen in some of the poorest countries of the world as a new imperialism”. Welby has put the global Anglican church at the heart of his leadership of the C of E. He has visited all member churches around the world, some several times, since being appointed archbishop of Canterbury 10 years ago. Unlike the C of E, whose congregations are shrinking year by year amid official data showing that Christianity is now a minority faith in England, churches in the global south are growing rapidly in size and influence. At the synod, Welby came close to tears when he acknowledged that the C of E blessing same-sex unions could put Anglicans in some countries at serious risk. “People [will] die, women [will] be raped, children [will] be tortured … This is not just about what people say, it’s what they’ll suffer,” he said. “I beg you to believe that there’s nothing in my life or heart or prayers that comes as high as the safety and flourishing of people I love in the Anglican Communion.”</body>

    <head>MPs should not influence church on same-sex marriage, says Justin Welby</head>
    <body>The archbishop of Canterbury has warned MPs that he will ignore threats of parliamentary intervention to force the Church of England to allow same-sex couples to marry in church. Speaking at the C of E’s national assembly, the General Synod, Justin Welby said members should not be swayed on the issue by “groups or lobbies or outsiders”. He said he had heard such efforts to influence the church “over the last two weeks in parliament, and being told exactly what to do. I’m not doing any of it.” A group of Conservative and Labour MPs are weighing up options aimed at bringing the C of E into line with the law of the land with regard to same-sex marriage. The synod spent five hours on Wednesday debating a proposal by bishops to allow clergy to offer blessings in church to same-sex couples who have undergone a civil marriage. The bishops also propose to review a ban on clergy entering into same-sex civil marriages and a celibacy rule for clergy in same-sex relationships. The debate will resume on Thursday morning. The bishops hope that a decisive vote for their motion will put an end to years of painful divisions and disagreement over sexuality. Welby said he supported church blessings for same-sex couples in civil marriages, not because he was “controlled by [the] culture” of wider society, but because it was right based on “scripture, reason and tradition”. Acknowledging the concerns of some conservative Christians that the move will inevitably lead to the C of E offering marriage equality to same-sex couples, he said: “I know there is fear of a slippery slope … But let us not give in to the fear of the future which we can neither predict nor control. Fear leads us to do the wrong things.” Jayne Ozanne, a prominent equality campaigner, asked the synod to throw out a proposed apology to LGBT+ people, saying its primary purpose was to make those issuing it feel better. “It’s akin to an abusive partner who keeps telling the one they abuse that they love them and that they are sorry, and they will never do it again,” she said. “A psychotherapist will tell you that is a harmful cycle of abuse.” Busola Sodeinde requested that leaders of Anglican churches across the world – many of which hold traditional views on sexuality – be consulted about the impact of C of E blessings of same sex civil marriages. Such a move could result in disunity in the global church and the “exodus of diverse communities from our parish churches” in England, she said. In an emotional response, Welby acknowledged that churches in some countries could be at risk if the C of E – the mother church of the global Anglican Communion – liberalised its stance. “I beg you to believe there is nothing in my life or heart or prayers that comes as high as the safety and flourishing of people I love in the Anglican Communion,” he said.</body>

    <head>Sumner Redstone: book reveals media mogul’s ‘astonishing saga of sex, lies and betrayal’</head>
    <body>There was a time, not long ago, that America’s media and entertainment businesses were largely run as personal fiefdoms of their owners, executives and top stars. Then came the #MeToo movement and the sexual harassment scandals of Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer and a host of others. Now a new account of the career of media mogul Sumner Redstone, who died in 2020 at the age of 97, reveals just how awful, shocking and abusive that culture was at one of America’s biggest media empires. The book, by New York Times journalists James Stewart and Rachel Abrams, paints a fresh picture of a corporate culture that believed that so long as the stock went up, and complex C-suite power games were in play, there was no compelling reason to place checks on the appetites of those whose need for control spanned institutional and sexual power. At the peak of his power, Redstone controlled Viacom, Paramount Pictures, movie-theater chain National Amusements, CBS, MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and the publisher Simon &amp; Schuster. In the age before Netflix and HBO, these household names threw off cash and prestige on an industrial-scale. But as Unscripted: The Epic Battle for a Media Empire and the Redstone Family Legacy details, there was “an astonishing saga of sex, lies, and betrayal” taking place behind the scenes. Many incidents, but not all, involved Redstone himself. The son of a Boston linoleum salesman, Redstone finished at the top of his class at the Boston Latin School and won a scholarship to Harvard. He had helped crack Japanese codes during World War II, and turned his father’s two drive-in theater business into multi-billion media behemoth of multiplexes – a term he coined – infused with the smell of popcorn. The structural complexity of the companies Redstone controlled gave him free rein to indulge his instincts. In his houses, TVs were tuned to the stock price of the National Amusements, which he controlled through a preferential share-ownership structure. But Redstone’s fortune was only half the story: what he did with it was itself an epic saga of brutal politicking and sexual predation. His ruthless will made him not a man to be argued with. He had, after all, once saved himself from incineration in a burning Boston hotel by hanging off a window ledge until his hand was badly and permanently disfigured. According to Unscripted, Redstone amended his trust more than 40 times to add or remove beneficiaries, often the women he dated who got progressively younger as he got older. Several received $20m, “a lot” received $10m, and “many, many” received over $1m. He propositioned one future girlfriend, 26-year-old Malia Andelin, who was working as a flight attendant on the company jet, with the line: “Who the fuck are you?” She responded in kind. “I hear women like to be spanked,” Redstone followed up. “Do you like to be spanked?” “Some say I created Mission: Impossible, and some say that this mission is impossible,” Redstone told Andelin in a message on her voicemail. “But I made this mission possible… I know that if you called me back and you were a risk‑taker, this call could perhaps change your life.” He sent her a crystal‑encrusted handbag in the shape of a panther. “I’m a panther and I’m going to pounce,” read a note. Redstone reportedly dated his grandson’s girlfriends. “He acts like a 15‑year‑old kid at summer camp,” one executive remarked. At age 85, he boasted on a retreat for fellow media moguls: “I have the vital statistics of a 20-year-old!” Sumner Redstone and family in 2012. Photograph: Picture Perfect/REX/Shutterstock He fought with his daughter, Shari, and into his 80s lived in a mansion with two women, Sydney Holland and Manuela Herzer, who, converted from lovers to gatekeepers, scheduled his girlfriends and isolated him from his family and friends. As Redstone became increasing senile, his daughter tried to expel his minders and, later, to recover the $150m he had handed over to them after he was warned he would die alone if they left him. But as that drama progressed CBS’s CEO Les Moonves becomes embroiled in another. As the CBS board hatched a plan to dilute the old man’s control by merging CBS and Viacom, Moonves, a one-time daytime TV actor, was exposed by then #MeToo crusader Ronan Farrow who located six women with accusations of harassment and intimidation and published their accounts in the New Yorker. “It’s top down, this culture of older men who have all this power and you are nothing,” a veteran producer told the magazine. “The company is shielding lots of bad behavior.” Moonves left the company in 2018 and sued for a $120m severance package. Three years later, he settled a New York State investigation into stock sales before the sexual harassment allegations were made public for more than $30m. Unscripted offers shocking insight into the company’s culture during the Redstone-Moonves era. In one instance, Redstone spent $500,000 promoting the Electric Barbarellas, a breathtakingly trashy all-girl band, who made their CBS network debut on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on March 2011. MTV executives protested the development of a Barbarellas reality show, calling the group “unwatchable and the music just as bad”. Sumner insisted: “I won’t be defied,” he said. Reviewers branded the show a “hypercontrived, superstaged, and hair‑extensioned mess”. One question that hangs over the Redstone-Moonves era, as it does the media industry at large, is how the attitudes and behavior of senior executives within corporates structures exert influence beyond their immediate environment. In which case, the culture of Redstone’s empire had a traumatizing and abusive impact far wider than just the corporate offices in which it played out. “It’s common sense that the people who run the media industry have an influence on the things we see and the culture they are controlling,”said Robert Thompson, trustee professor at the S .I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. “When American television was run by white males what we saw was reflected in the things they thought interesting. It’s one of the reasons why there was a call was to diversify not only what was in front of the camera but also behind the camera”, Thompson said. “One can certainly see how the culture of that period created so much of the misbehavior we got. Executives operating on the level of wealth, power and entitlement are in some ways living in a different world. Whatever their id tells them, they have the resources to fulfill it.” But there’s a larger question, too. The corporate structure of Redstone’s media creation was so complex and subject to his need for control that few were able or willing to challenge it. When Redstone died during the Covid-19 pandemic, he was buried in his hometown of Boston. Few were present, but one of those was his daughter Shari. At the end of the service, she knelt close to his grave and sang Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” – a song to which Redstone often returned. Even in death, apparently, his power lingered. “You use the corporate structure to keep people confused enough to maintain another kind of control,” Thompson pointed out. “You’ve got these bad behaviors that #MeToo tried to exorcise, but that moves into a weird choreography of exploitation. Every element of this is a tale as old as time.” • This article was amended on 18 February 2023 to include the names of Unscripted’s authors, which were inadvertently lost during editing.</body>

    <head>The rise of voluntary celibacy: ‘Most of the sex I’ve had, I wish I hadn’t bothered’</head>
    <body>Caitlin didn’t set out to become celibate – at least not in the beginning. Three years ago, she was coming out of an abusive relationship and wasn’t ready to meet someone else. Then Covid happened, and the lockdowns made it impossible anyway. “I thought during that time I needed space to heal and reflect on what I’d been through,” she says. Towards the end of 2020, the 23-year-old artist started therapy. “I realised if I was going to be sexually active, I needed someone who would understand my past, and where I was coming from. I don’t want to be with someone unless I know it’s committed, and I’m not in a rush to find that.” She had been on dating apps, but found it hard to meet men who wanted a relationship, rather than just sex. “I found they would stop talking to me if I made it known I wasn’t going to hook up with them on the first date. I found a lot of men would put on a bit of an act to appear as if they wanted a relationship, then as soon as you took sex off the table while getting to know them, they disappeared. It’s tricky when a lot of dating is around hook-up culture, which I’m not interested in.” Caitlin’s celibacy, three years in now, became intentional. She hasn’t missed sex itself, she says, and certainly not casual sex, although sometimes, “seeing people in relationships and having healthy sex lives, can make me go: ‘Why don’t I have that?’” But it has had unintentional benefits. “It’s taught me more about what I enjoy in sex, which I wasn’t expecting. I thought it was going to put me at a disadvantage, but I feel a lot more confident in my own sexuality.” While sex with someone else is out, masturbation is still in, and she says her libido has increased. “I think because exploring different things without dealing with another person has allowed me to find what I enjoy.” It has also made her more relaxed about finding a relationship (or not). “I’ve got other things to focus on. It’s if someone fits into my life rather than me needing to make room for them.” On TikTok, voluntary or intentional celibacy has become a trend – the #celibacy hashtag has had more than 195m views – with those who practise it claiming it has improved their focus, mental health and energy. In January, it was reported that there was a 90% increase in Google searches for celibacy that month. Most of the sex I’ve had, I wish I hadn’t bothered. It wasn’t what I thought it was going to be “This coincides with a long‑term trend among people today, in general, having less sex with fewer partners,” says Dr Justin Lehmiller, a Kinsey Institute research fellow and host of the Sex and Psychology podcast. “Humans are increasingly less sexually active, with some forgoing sex altogether.” Study after study of sexual behaviour, in different countries, show this. The last National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) in Britain found that 16% of men and 22% of women aged 16 to 74 were sexually inactive, and for most of them, it wasn’t a problem. While the authors noted the documented wellbeing benefits of a satisfying sex life, of those who had previously had sexual experience, the majority were not dissatisfied with their situation (around a third of men, and a quarter of women reported they were dissatisfied, although age had an effect, with younger people more dissatisfied than older people). The Natsal data is more than 10 years old, though, and its authors noted in a 2019 paper on the sexually inactive how little is known about them. The National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior in the US found that between 2009 and 2018 there was a rise in adolescents reporting no sexual activity (partnered and alone), from 28.8% to 44.2% of young men and from 49.5% to 74% of young women. In one interview, the study’s authors raised several possible contributing factors, including gaming and social media taking time and precedence, more awareness of asexuality as an identity, a decline in alcohol use, an increase in “rough sex” practices such as choking that may be frightening or off-putting to many, and lower incomes. Voluntary celibacy in the US, where Lehmiller is based, seems to have more links to religion than it does in the UK. Furthermore, he says, “in this #MeToo and post-Roe era [with the rollback of reproductive rights] we find ourselves in, the perceived risks associated with sex are higher, particularly for women. And, when you factor in the orgasm gap and the fact that women’s pleasure still isn’t on a par with men’s, some women are asking themselves whether sex is even worth it. If you see it as a high-risk, low-reward kind of thing, you might decide you’re better off without it.” He suggests that celibacy, for some, may be part of “the growing trend towards delayed adulthood. Individuals might see sex and relationships as distractions, or as not having much point until they’ve found stability in other life circumstances.” The pressures of studying, establishing a career or saving for a home may take priority. While voluntary celibacy seems less popular among non‑religious heterosexual men, some have talked online about intentional celibacy providing more focus for their careers, with sex being a distraction. For those who are dating, apps have changed the way many people find partners, but as Lehmiller points out, online dating is an arena “where there’s a lot of toxic behaviour, brutal rejection and feelings of intense competition for mates. It can make sex and relationships feel like a high-stress, high-stakes thing. Some people may find that taking a pause from that is good for their mental health.” While celibacy is for many a positive personal choice, it can also be viewed as the result of, or a reaction against, a messed-up sexual culture, just as some of the second wave feminists chose political lesbianism decades ago. Last year, the “femcel”, or “female involuntary celibate”, went mainstream. “They feel the same sense of ‘humiliation and exclusion’ that ‘incels’ do,” as a piece in the Atlantic put it, “but they react to those feelings differently.” Unlike the notorious misogynistic incels who blame women for not wanting to have sex with them, femcels posting in online groups tend to blame their celibacy on the soul-destroying sexual landscape and a society that, for all its hollow talk of “body positivity”, is still obsessed with looks and beauty conventions. Louise Perry, author of The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, says that many young heterosexual women “now feel as if they have to run the gauntlet of hook-up culture if they want to have any kind of sexual relationship. I think a lot of them, quite fairly, would rather not have any sexual relationship at all.” The influence and availability of pornography, she adds, “has had a really destructive effect on sexual culture.” She says surveys show that “most women don’t get that much out of casual sex. The problem is, because our sexual culture is so oriented towards a more masculine style of sexuality, a lot of young women in particular don’t feel as if they are able to demand commitment from their partners. Increasing numbers are opting out of the sexual culture altogether.” It’s naive, she says, to think you can simply choose to avoid pornography and casual sex if you’re sexually active, “because the nature of sex in general, and social relationships, is that they’re networked – you have sex with people who have sex with other people, who watch porn. Even if you choose not to do that, other people do it, and it changes the culture. I think that, particularly in young people, who are super-sensitive to what other people think about them, the default setting now is to have pornified, casual sex.” For some people, opting out might feel like their only option. *** Not that voluntary celibacy has just been invented. Stephen gave up sex more than 20 years ago, when he had just turned 40. “I’d become disillusioned with the gay scene, and too much casual sex with strangers. While I was in my 20s it could be fun, but most of the time, when I had sex with someone I’d just met, I was always hoping it was going to be more than just the one night. I was hoping for a relationship.” The last time he had sex, he contracted syphilis, which was the final straw. A year or so ago, now in his early 60s, Stephen thought he might make another attempt at a sex life. “I gave Grindr a go, and that was quite an eye-opener.” The dating scene had changed in his decades of celibacy, with apps making casual hook-ups even easier, and he says he was alarmed by the number of people who wanted to have sex while taking drugs. He went on three dates with different men. “We did a bit of touching and kissing, but when it came to going any further, each time I said: ‘I’ve changed my mind.’ Now I’ve put myself back on the shelf. Most of the sex I’ve ever had, I wish I hadn’t bothered. It wasn’t what I thought it was going to be and it just seems so much effort for something that’s over quickly. Looking back, it’s all very disappointing.” He has missed intimacy, but companionship and affection have come from friends and his dogs. He is still open to being in a relationship, he says, and hasn’t lost his sex drive, but he thinks he is unlikely to meet someone now. “I’d need to have sex with someone I’ve known, even just for a few weeks, or a few days, instead of with someone whose name you can’t quite remember. An intimate but non-sexual relationship might be the best for me. It would be nice to lie in bed with someone, be an old married couple from the start.” Celibacy, says Ammanda Major, head of clinical practice for Relate, “works when it works, and it doesn’t work when it doesn’t work. A lot of this comes down to: is this something that you feel is important to you, and you’re doing it for you? Or is it something that you feel is imposed on you, for reasons that might be very difficult? Like you’ve had a period without a partner, or you’ve gone through a period of ill health, whether mental or physical.” If it hasn’t been a positive choice, she says, it could “cause people to feel potentially unloved and uncared for”. Online dating is an arena where there’s a lot of toxic behaviour and brutal rejection It can also raise problems, unsurprisingly, in relationships where one partner wants to follow a celibate lifestyle, but the other doesn’t. In that situation, you have to be willing to have a potentially difficult conversation about what it means for your relationship. Our society puts a lot of emphasis on sex, “but it’s not for everyone”, she says. “Celibacy can be a conscious decision, or it may be something that you just gently morph into and that also feels OK for you.” Major suggests asking yourself what celibacy brings to your life. “Are you cutting yourself off from sex, or are you cutting yourself off from intimacy? Are they the same for you? Can you be intimate while being celibate?” It can certainly have benefits in a variety of situations, she says. “It’s not unusual for people after the breakup of a relationship, or periods of a lot of sexual activity, to take a step back and think: ‘I need to do some self-care, which involves taking myself out of this sexual arena at the moment. I will engage with it again at some point, but this is time to think about what I want to do next.’ Which may be to maintain celibacy, or it may be to engage with an intimate partner or several partners.” Without her period of intentional celibacy a few years ago, after a breakup, Kelly Jenner believes she wouldn’t have changed her relationship patterns for the better. “I went for men who were very unavailable,” she says. “Now I’m in the healthiest relationship I’ve ever had – I’ve got clear boundaries, we have healthy conversations, whereas I never had that before I did intentional celibacy.” Now a breakup recovery coach, Jenner often recommends a period of celibacy to others. How long it lasts is less important, she thinks, than the intention; simply a sexless period between partners doesn’t necessarily come with the same benefits. “The intention changes your whole mindset around dating.” For Hope Flynn, 31, head of content for iPlaySafe, a home-testing STI kit and app, her eight-month stretch of celibacy – she had been having sex about three times a week, so it was intentional rather than a mere dry spell – was about resetting her attitudes to sex. “I really enjoy sex, but I started to notice I was using it in the wrong way,” she says. She was going through a difficult time – she was trying to launch a business and had experienced a couple of bereavements – and would seek no-strings sex as a distraction and for comfort. “It wasn’t really doing anything for me, other than making me feel as if I was making wrong decisions. I had to put the brakes on it for a few months, and focus on myself and making myself feel better.” It was sometimes difficult, she says. “It was lonely at times, and I felt like I was being my own fun police, but it was needed.” Earlier this year, she had another period of abstention – this time from pornography and masturbation, because she felt that had got out of control. “I wanted to have a better relationship with porn, and use my own imagination a bit more.” Both sexual breaks helped her focus on other areas of her life by removing sex as a distraction, and it made her appreciate sex more when she started being intimate again. “When I was having sex so regularly, it just becomes something that you do, but it was nice to have that break and make it special again.” Some names have been changed</body>

    <head>The Sex Party review – spiky comedy fails to satisfy</head>
    <body>At first, The Sex Party looks like a retro BBC sitcom about swingers, although that term is banned at this adult shindig. Four couples collect for sex and nibbles at a cool north London postcode. There is gleeful talk about getting it on and a fair share of parading around in lingerie and thigh boots. But Terry Johnson’s spiky comedy takes us from the familiar fare of smut and sniggering double entendres to something bolder and more awkward in the sex/gender debate at its centre, even if it does not reach a satisfying end. We only ever see what happens in the high-end kitchen (set designed by Tim Shortall) but we get a vivid idea of the action in the living room from the moans and groans we hear. In a production also directed by Johnson, the acting stays fine across the board although the characters are flimsy (Lisa Dwan especially does wonders with her part) and the star casting of Timothy Hutton stays strangely marginal for too long. He drifts on and off stage, saying little and looking like a cliched California guru in yoga pants. Not just smut … Molly Osborne, Jason Merrells and Lisa Dwan. Photograph: Alastair Muir The dialogue often goes off on random, unruly riffs; one character (Will Barton) talks about taking MDMA and the dialogue sounds under the influence too. The play’s grenade is lobbed as the first act closes, with the entry of Lucy (Pooya Mohseni), a trans woman, and from here on in it feels like another play altogether. Doris Lessing, in a Penguin introduction to Lady Chatterley’s Lover, wrote that what happens in the bedroom is a “report on the sex war” outside it and it seems to be the case with this living room; suddenly, no one wants to convene there and a very live tension is in the air. Related: Timothy Hutton on The Sex Party: ‘Do I think it will be controversial? I don’t know …’ Much is flung at us, from talk of toilets to language and JK Rowling and it feels genuinely edgy. It is brave of Johnson to grapple with a debate that has become so divisive that a meeting of this kind would be unimaginable in real life. But arguments come thick and fast without being explored. Johnson seems to be shooting an arrow through the issues of the day – including, too briefly, consent – but it comes to feel like a dramatised version of Twitter. The room exposes its bigots and we finally see the point of Hutton’s character but as more plot-points are lobbed at us in the closing moments it feels much less like a sitcom than an entire series rolled into one production. At the Menier Chocolate Factory, London, until 7 January</body>

    <head>This is how we do it: ‘I hired an artist to paint us together in the nude’</head>
    <body>Janet, 59 I can’t remember how Alan and I ended up having sex for the first time. We’d probably had a few too many drinks. I was 10 years out of a tricky divorce and I’d developed a bad habit: I would sleep with a man and then immediately go off him. I used to call it the “garage-door moment”. I’d be in love with a guy one second, and then he’d say something yucky, and – boom! – the automatic door would roll down. I wouldn’t fancy him any more. For a long time, I’d resisted sleeping with Alan because I didn’t want the garage door to go down on him. We’d been friends for 20 years and our children went to school together. Also, I tend to go for big, brassy real-estate salesman guys. Prima-donna types. And Alan is the exact opposite of that. He is strong and determined, but quietly so. One night we did get into bed together and he surprised me – because he was so sweet. I just hadn’t imagined he would be so good at sex. He’s not a tall, broad guy but he is very well endowed. I can take a little time to climax and Alan was, and still is, very attentive to that. He always makes sure I’m having just as much fun as him. I can take a little time to climax and Alan is very attentive to that I’m 59 now and Alan’s just had his 60th. In my 20s I might have dressed up in lingerie or tried a million different positions to keep a husband happy. I can’t be bothered with that now. I’ve always truly preferred really good missionary sex. Missionary is underrated! I think Alan would like to occasionally have some more adventurous sex. Although when I mentioned the lingerie to him the other day he said: ‘Oh, don’t worry! It would be off pretty quick … ” But we do like to surprise each other, now and then. For my birthday last year Alan warned me we’d be having a night in, no kids, and we would be expecting just one visitor. I said: “Is this a threesome? Is this your birthday present or mine?!” Turns out the visitor was an artist, who did a sketch of the two of us, naked. It hangs in our bathroom now. Alan thinks outside the box in that way, which is one of the many things I love about him. Neither of us expected to find this quality of intimacy at this stage of our lives. Alan, 60 I had known Janet for about 20 years before we first had sex and, if I’m honest, I never thought I stood a chance with her. Janet is a glamorous woman of the world. What could she possibly want with a dickhead like me? I would go over to her house sometimes in the evening and we would moan about our bad divorces, but I would always end up walking home alone, after giving her a very chaste peck on the cheek. Then one night we ended up in her bedroom and the sex felt so intuitive and loving, if you can say “loving” when it’s that early on in a relationship. Janet has a rare confidence in her body and in herself. It must have been only the third time we had sex when she brought a vibrator out of her cabinet. I thought: that’s terrific! It must have been only the third time we had sex when she brought a vibrator out of her cabinet. I thought: that’s terrific! It was the polar opposite of my previous experiences. I was used to doing it with the lights off. I hadn’t seen my ex-partner naked for the last three years of our marriage. Janet likes being naked so much she will sometimes boil the kettle starkers. It’s contagious. Janet says she has “created a monster”. For her last birthday I hired an artist to paint us together, on our sofa, in the nude. We have been together for seven years and probably have sex once a week. It would be more if Janet liked morning sex, but she doesn’t. In my younger days I might have made an issue out of a thing like that, but the great thing about getting into a relationship in your 50s is you don’t let meaningless things become an issue. Janet prefers sex in the evenings – and I don’t see it as a rejection of me. We speak honestly if we ever have a little disagreement, so we get over it fast and that all leads to better sex. What I love is that Janet and I are so comfortable with each other. Sometimes I will even sort myself out in bed next to her in the morning, while she’s reading the paper. It’s strangely romantic.

    <head>A job at Vivienne Westwood’s shop made me a Sex Pistol</head>
    <body>I walked into Let It Rock, looking for a pair of brothel creepers. I’d been in there a bit too long and some guy says: “Can I help you?” I said I was looking for work. I’d been fired from my part-time job in the trouser department at Whiteley’s. He told me to call Malcolm and Vivienne. That’s how I started out in the shop. They probably thought I was just some straight kid, which I was. A month or two later, I asked Vivienne to ask Malcolm if he’d give me a reference for art college. She said: “Really? I don’t think you’d want to ask Malcolm because he’s been thrown out of every college in London.” Straightaway I was more interested in them and they were more interested in me. That summer, McLaren and Westwood turned the shop into Sex. They were fed up with the rightwing mentality of the teddy boys and I helped with the sign outside. I’d learned how to silk-screen, so they asked me to do two images: a big red baseball player with a massive dick and another of two cowboys with their willies touching. I said I’d give it a go. It took too long and Vivienne got all dogmatic, saying I was trying to censor her work when I wasn’t at all. If you got on her wrong side, she’d let you know. About then, Steve (Jones) and Paul (Cook) started coming in. It was my job to keep an eye on them. They were trying to get a band together and I overheard them saying they needed a bass player. So that’s how it started. A lot of people think Vivienne and Malcolm made all the clothes but they didn’t – they provided a base where we all met. The hippest place in London on a Saturday afternoon, where every oddball and weirdo congregated. We gravitated there for our own reasons, a mishmash of people who went on to do something. And Vivienne was like the madam of a belle epoque salon. I don’t think she did it deliberately. She picked up on things, such as when John [Lydon] came in with a safety pin through his ear. Whatever she did, she did with real artisanship and craft. If something came back from Mr Green in the East End with a seam in the wrong place, Vivienne was on it. She used tailoring to get her ideas across, to turn what you were supposed to look like on its head. She was always at the V&amp;A or the Wallace Collection. She was into the conflict of ideas and knew what she wanted to do. She was one of the first vegetarians I met. Yet when I got chicken, she’d take the bones home to boil and sew on to T-shirts. They’d had the shop less than a year when I turned up and were still trying to work out what they wanted to do. It’s amazing now. There’s a Vivienne Westwood flagship store in Shanghai and go to Harajuku in Tokyo and the girls are dressed in Westwood. From chicken bones to head of a fashion empire: it’s only by sticking out that you get lasting acclaim and to have continual success is hard. She did it. I’m not sure we’ll see the likes of her again. • Glen Matlock was the bass player for Sex Pistols • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    <head>Drugs, sex and killings: six explosive revelations from Prince Harry’s book</head>
    <body>1. Dog bowl fight The Duke of Sussex alleges he scuffled with his brother at his home in Nottingham Cottage in 2019 when the Prince of Wales called his wife Meghan “difficult”, “rude” and “abrasive”. “Everything happened so fast. Really, really fast. He grabbed me by the collar of my shirt, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor … I fell on top of the dog’s bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces of it cutting into me.” He will tell ITV’s Tom Bradby on Sunday that he saw a “red mist” descend on William. 2. Baby Brain row Preparations for Harry and Meghan’s wedding led to rows between the bride and her future sister-in-law, the Princess of Wales. Meghan’s suggestion that her hormones might have resulted in “baby brain” after the birth of Prince Louis in a phone call about wedding rehearsals infuriated Kate. It is alleged that Prince William pointed at Meghan and said this was not how things were done in Britain. It is also claimed the Princess of Wales made the Duchess cry when she asked her to sort out Princess Charlotte’s oversized flower girl dress for the ceremony. 3. Nazi outfit choice The Prince and Princess of Wales were partly responsible, the book claims, for the row in 2005 after Prince Harry was photographed wearing a German Nazi uniform at a fancy dress party. He says he called for advice before the event and they told him to go in the costume, complete with swastika armband, adding that they howled with laughter, before photographs were sold to the press. 4. Taliban “kills” The Duke reveals that, as an Apache helicopter co-pilot during a second tour of duty in Afghanistan, he killed more than two dozen people. He is neither proud of nor ashamed of the deaths, he says, that resulted from six flying missions, adding that he thought of those killed as “chess pieces” on a board. His candour may increase security fears around him. 5. Behind a pub The Duke admits to losing his virginity to an “older lady” who “loved horses very much” during “a humiliating episode” in a field behind a pub. He writes: “I mounted her quickly, after which she spanked my ass and held me back … One of my mistakes was letting it happen in a field, just behind a busy pub.” 6. Drugs Prince Harry confesses to using cocaine as a teenager, smoking marijuana and later trying magic mushrooms at a party in the home of actor Courteney Cox. He writes: “Of course, I had been taking cocaine at that time. At someone’s house, during a hunting weekend, I was offered a line, and since then I had consumed some more …It wasn’t very fun, and it didn’t make me feel especially happy as seemed to happen to others, but it did make me feel different, and that was my main objective. To feel. To be different.”</body>

    <head>Biden signs landmark law protecting same-sex and interracial marriages</head>
    <body>Joe Biden on Tuesday signed into law landmark legislation protecting same-sex marriages, hailing it as a step toward building a nation where “decency, dignity and love are recognized, honored and protected”. The signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House was an elaborate celebration, with thousands of guests, some waving rainbow flags, and performances by the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington DC, Sam Smith and Cyndi Lauper. Related: Biden signs executive order to curb anti-trans laws and conversion therapy “The road to this moment has been long, but those who believe in equality and justice, you never gave up,” Biden said in remarks, before signing the Respect for Marriage Act. He added: “This law and the love it defends strikes a blow against hate in all its forms.” For many in attendance, the legislation was deeply personal. The transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay cabinet member, was there. Also present was Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin, a lead sponsor of the bill and the first openly gay member of that chamber. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he was wearing the same purple tie he wore to his daughter’s wedding. Schumer’s daughter and her wife are expecting their first child next year. “Thanks to the dogged work of many of my colleagues, my grandchild will live in a world that will respect and honor their mothers’ marriage,” the New York Democrat said, his voice catching. There was sustained applause for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. The long-serving congresswoman from San Francisco, a prominent champion of LGBTQ+ rights, praised the crowd of advocates and activists for their “patriotism” and “impatience”. Pelosi, who will soon step down from Democratic leadership, said it was fitting that “one of my final acts as speaker” was to gavel down the vote protecting same-sex marriage last week. The historic legislation, passed with bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress, protects same-sex and interracial marriages, prohibiting federal and state governments from denying the validity of a lawfully performed union on the basis of sex, race or ethnicity. The law also repeals the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (Doma), which defined a marriage as the union between a man and a woman and denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. Though the supreme court struck down part of the law, it remained on the books. To cheers, tears, applause and laughter, Biden turned the bill into law with the flick of his pen, surrounded by congressional leaders and LGBTQ+ members of Congress.

Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images In his remarks, Biden also acknowledged the fear faced by many LGBTQ+ Americans, in the face of a conservative backlash over gender issues and alarming incidents of violence against their community. Last month, five people were shot dead at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs. The suspect was charged with hate crimes. Biden condemned the “callous and cynical” laws passed by Republican state legislatures that target transgender students and athletes and vowed to keep fighting to guarantee further protections. “Racism, antisemitism, homophobia, transphobia, they’re all connected,” he said. “But the antidote to hate is love.” The president’s signature was the culmination of a months-long scramble by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, set in motion by fear the right to same-sex marriage could be imperiled after the supreme court’s decision in June to overturn Roe v Wade, eliminating the right to abortion. In a concurring opinion, the conservative justice Clarence Thomas suggested the court should reconsider cases such as Obergefell v Hodges, the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Should Obergefell fall, states would not be required to issue marriage licenses for same-sex marriage. But they would now have to recognize unions performed in states where they were legal. In a concession to Republicans, the new law also includes a religious liberty exemption, allowing churches and non-profits to refuse goods, services and accommodations for same-sex marriages. Speaking before Biden on Tuesday, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, recalled how she performed some of the earliest same-sex marriages in the US in 2004, when she was district attorney of San Francisco. Later, as attorney general of California, Harris refused to defend a ban on same-sex marriages in the state. “The Dobbs decision reminds us that fundamental rights are interconnected,” Harris said, referring to the supreme court case that overruled Roe and other precedents, “including the right to marry who you love, the right to access contraception and the right to make decisions about your own body.” Though the legislation passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support, most Republicans opposed it despite widespread acceptance for same-sex unions among the general public. Just over 25 years ago, nearly seven in 10 Americans said marriages between same-sex couples should not be recognized by law, according to Gallup. Now almost exactly the same number – a record 71% – say same-sex unions should be legal. Biden’s support for LGBTQ+ rights has evolved. In 1996, as a senator, he voted for Doma. On Tuesday, he formally erased it from statute. Biden has been described as the “most pro-equality” president in American history. As vice-president, Biden became the highest-ranking US official to endorse same-sex marriage, announcing his position in May 2012 and prompting the then president, Barack Obama, to declare his support days later. Before Biden spoke, attendees watched a clip from that interview, comments for which Biden joked he “got in trouble”. Paraphrasing his remarks from a decade ago, he said: “I mean this with all my heart: marriage is a simple proposition. Who do you love? And will you be loyal to that person you love? It’s not more complicated than that.” That evening, as night fell on the nation’s capital, the South Portico of the White House was illuminated in rainbow colors to celebrate what Biden said was the US government declaring “loudly and clearly: love is love”.</body>

    <head>A sex worker with an ankle tag – Bruce LaBruce’s best photograph</head>
    <body>I met this hustler in the pre-Grindr era, around 2004, probably in one of the hustler bars in Los Angeles that no longer exist. A likely scenario is that I took him back to where I was staying, at my friend Billy’s place. That’s where the shot was taken. I’m pretty sure Billy was out of town. When the hustler got there, I realised he had this ankle bracelet on to track him. He was under house arrest, I think, for breaking and entering. I don’t think he was supposed to come and see me. It was obviously in violation of his parole, but that didn’t seem to bother him. I actually have another photo of this guy: my friend Terence Koh had filled the basement of a gallery with white powder that looked like cocaine and this same hustler stripped off and started doing snow angels in it. So I took a photo. There’s a thing with hustlers not wanting to be identified in photographs so you learn certain tricks: I’ve shot one with a shirt over his head, another with his back to the camera. With this image, I like the way the foot is framed on the Louis Vuitton trunk. It’s a paradoxical juxtaposition. You think: “What could this be? What is the backstory?” The dirty toenails are interesting, too. The bruise on the foot adds another question. I also like the colours: the various browns of the skin, trunk and hardwood floor. It’s a weirdly warm image, even though it’s a harsh subject. The flip phone on the trunk dates it to a particular era. I remember, back in the late 1990s, we all started carrying around these little Yashica T4 cameras. You would be at a party and four people would suddenly pull out a Yashica and take a picture. Whether it was somebody drunk, taking their clothes off or snorting cocaine off someone’s penis, it would be documented by four different cameras. The flip phone on the trunk dates it to an era before smartphones, one of the most horrible technological advances ever This was all before smartphones. The smartphone is not like a camera. It’s a flat screen, there’s no viewfinder and it also flips, which is probably one of the most horrible technological advances ever, because it ushered in the selfie. Essentially, it reversed the whole history of photography, because the camera now pointed back at you. I think aesthetics really suffered with the smartphone. There’s not as much attention to framing and composition. The photos in my new book are all from the era before smartphones and they definitely have a different quality to them. Back in the 1990s, I made the movie Hustler White, about street hustlers on Santa Monica Boulevard and the end of that scene. I also did a lot of pornographic photoshoots for New York magazines in the late 90s and early 00s: I shot for Honcho, Playguy, Inches, Black Inches. I’ve always been kind of stuck in this weird netherworld between art and porn – where my work is too artistic for porn people and too pornographic for art people. But I think the distinction is moot, really. I get labelled a provocateur and I think that’s pretty apt. I mean, it’s better than being called an ageing enfant terrible, which I also get. But I came out of the punk scene, so provocation was part of the strategy. With my movies, I became known for shocking scenes and I went through a phase of trying to constantly outdo myself. Sometimes I think I’ve gone too far – like, what am I doing? But the idea of shocking people out of their complacency is a radical proposition, as well as just kind of fun. As for this particular image, well, maybe if you brought home a guy with an ankle tag on you would remember it better – but this was during my party days and it was just business as usual for me back then. In a way, that’s the point of all the images in my new book: they’re ephemeral. If it wasn’t for the photographic evidence, I’d never know some had even happened. Bruce LaBruce’s CV Bruce LaBruce.

    <head>South Korean court recognises legal status of same-sex couples for first time</head>
    <body>A court in South Korea has ruled that same-sex couples are entitled to the same spousal coverage under the national health insurance service as heterosexual couples – the first time the country has recognised the legal status of a gay partner. Tuesday’s landmark decision by the Seoul high court overturned a previous ruling by a lower court in January 2022 that rejected a gay couple’s petition after one partner was told he had to make separate health insurance payments. Under South Korean law, a dependent is exempt from making health insurance payments if their spouse meets certain employment conditions. The lower court threw out the petition because it did not recognise the partners as spouses. More than 30 countries, including Taiwan, have legalised same-sex marriage, but it is still illegal in South Korea and Japan, where pressure is building for a change to the law before the country hosts the G7 summit in May. A Seoul high court judge said in a brief statement that the lower court ruling had been overturned and insurance contributions imposed on one of the spouses revoked, adding that the insurance service would have to pay costs for both sides in the case, the Korea Herald reported. The ruling was the court’s “first recognition of the legal status of a same-sex couple”, said Park Han-hee, a lawyer who represented the plaintiff, according to the Yonhap news agency. Related: Anglicans reject Justin Welby as head of global church amid anger at same-sex blessings The decision was welcomed by the couple who launched the legal petition, So Sung-uk and Kim Yong-min. “I am delighted because I felt like the judges told us through a court decision that the feelings of love I have for my husband should not be the target of ignorance or insults,” So told reporters, according to the Herald. Kim said: “It took us such a long time to have our marriage status recognised within the legal framework.” The couple held a wedding ceremony in 2019 but were unable to register their marriage because South Korean authorities do not recognise their union as legal. Kim was registered as a spousal dependent as part of So’s insurance scheme in early 2020, according to reports, but the insurance service later ordered Kim to pay retrospective contributions since the couple were not legally married. The decision denied Kim the right to receive spousal coverage even though the service grants such rights to heterosexual common law couples. The high court, however, ruled spousal coverage under the state health insurance scheme was not limited to legally defined families, and that denying that right to same-sex couples was discriminatory, Yonhap said. Protecting the rights of minorities is the “biggest responsibility” of the court as the “last bastion” of human rights, the court added. Campaigners described the ruling as “significant”. “This is an important decision that moves South Korea closer to achieving marriage equality,” Amnesty International’s east Asia researcher, Boram Jang, said in a statement. “There is still a long way to go to end discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, but this ruling offers hope that prejudice can be overcome. “By not recognising partners in same-sex relationships, the national health insurance service was discriminating against same-sex couples, denying basic rights afforded to couples of the opposite sex. Today’s ruling will help to rectify this wrong. “This ruling is significant as the first decision legally recognising same-sex couples to be made by a court at any level in South Korea, but much more needs to be done to end discrimination against, and criminalisation of, the LGBTQ+ community.”</body>

    <head>I climax after 30 seconds of sex. What should I do?</head>
    <body>I am a single male in my 20s who often goes on dates, so usually when I have sex it is with somebody new. I climax way too early and often ejaculate prematurely. Is there anything I can do about it? I love sex but I find myself stressing about it because of performance anxiety. I sometimes pretend during intercourse that I haven’t ejaculated yet just to avoid the shame. At times, I only last for 30 seconds. I have a numbing spray, but it is very awkward to use and it can spoil the mood when I stop to apply it. How do I approach this problem, especially when getting with new people? While many women and men say they want athletic lovemaking with prolonged intercourse or penetration, many others say the opposite. The latter group either prefer a short amount of penetration with less chance of discomfort or irritation – or no penetration at all. This is especially understandable for women, since female pleasure and the means to orgasm are best achieved via direct stimulation of the clitoris, which is located outside the vagina. Early ejaculation is a treatable issue, but try not to stress about it. Being anxious about your “performance” will only exacerbate the situation. Instead, work on improving your ability to please your partner with skills that do not involve your penis, such as oral and manual stimulation. There are many highly erotic, non-penetrative techniques and it’s time you stopped worrying about how your penis performs and think about what else would directly please your partner. Combine good communication skills with your personal seductive style to elicit information about his or her preferences, and practice sharing what you need with them. Even people who do not worry about early ejaculation would be wise to adopt this course of action.

    <head>Best podcasts of the week: Sex therapist Chantelle Otten is here to save her listeners’ love lives</head>
    <body>Picks of the week Call Me Disabled Widely available, episodes weekly “Drop the euphemisms,” says Poppy Field (below) in this powerful new podcast. Although it’s a term that doesn’t work for everyone, Field is sick of being told how to identify after living with chronic pain and neurodivergence. Her first guest is Jameisha Prescod (who founded You Look Okay to Me) and they talk openly about advocating for themselves and others, asking for a wheelchair and the power of radical rest. Hannah Verdier Bodies Widely available, episodes weekly Allison Behringer’s thought-provoking and long-running podcast is back for a fourth season, with episodes on ADHD, early puberty and postpartum psychosis lined up. First up is an exploration of the importance of touch, with a moving contribution from a woman who gives burn survivors massage therapy and another who prefers a firm touch to light. HV Drawing on her own experiences of living with chronic illness and neurodivergency, Poppy Field hosts this illuminating series discussing what it means to identify as disabled. Photograph: - Off the Beaten Jack Widely available, episodes weekly This immersive travel series focuses less on places than the people you meet there. Its second season sees host Jack Boswell spend three months housesitting in a Mississippi town to create a portrait of a Bible belt community – from its strip club workers to its mayor. Alexi Duggins The Global Jigsaw BBC Sounds, episodes weekly Telling unique stories is the remit of this podcast from BBC Monitoring – who analyse 150 countries’ media across 100 languages for political, security and social shifts. From profiles of Syrian jihadis to the Turkish trend for street debates going viral on social media, it’s a measured, thoughtful look at issues around the world. AD Sex Therapy: Sessions With Chantelle Otten Audible, all episodes available now If you’re obsessed with the BBC’s Couples Therapy, this podcast is your next fly-on-the-wall experience in a real therapy room. This time it’s all about sex, from a married couple of 10 years who want to bring another person into the bedroom to a cis woman in a straight relationship who is bi-curious, sexologist Chantelle Otten takes them through a session. Hollie Richardson There’s a podcast for that Jameela Jamil, host of I Weigh, in The Good Place. Photograph: NBC/Getty Images This week, Hollie Richardson chooses five of the best podcasts with a purpose, from Jameela Jamil’s body confidence campaign to migrants’ tales of perseverance against the odds Anthems From the always brilliant Broccoli Productions, Anthems is a compelling collection of “original manifestos, speeches, stories, poems, and rallying cries”. Each of its miniseries focuses on a theme, from black British identity to Pride and Roe v Wade. The short, punchy episodes focus on a single word dissected by a guest host, and the results are funny, pondering, angry, challenging, inspiring and everything in between. Past voices include food writer Ruby Tandoh, the UK’s first out Muslim drag queen Asifa Lahore, singer Cat Burns, and UK Black Pride co-founder Lady Phyll. Climate of Change It’s both a reassuring and a terrifying thing to hear Cate Blanchett admit that she is as overwhelmed with eco-anxiety as much as the rest of us. But, as she recently told this paper, her aim is to “turn the magnet towards optimism” with a podcast that explores what’s happening right now to combat the climate crisis. This isn’t just a case of a wealthy celebrity turned podcast preacher: her co-host and friend Danny Kennedy has some serious eco credentials, as managing director of the California Clean Energy Fund. Perhaps it’s possible to end a chat about the climate on a positive note, after all. I Weigh Jameela Jamil isn’t one to stay quiet on how insidious body shaming is in the entertainment industry. In fact, after living with an eating disorder and having her body judged by tabloids on a daily basis, exposing body-related prejudice has become her cause. The presenter and actor launched the I Weigh community in 2018, an inclusive platform where a person’s worth isn’t down to a number on the scales. In this podcast, she speaks to big names in the business, including Reese Witherspoon and Kelly Rowland, as well as health and wellbeing experts, activists, and anybody who has got something to say about their relationship with their body, self-worth and mental health. The Martin Lewis Podcast What’s the difference between an Isa and a Lisa? What rights do renters have? What does the budget actually mean for little old me? For all of us struggling with those questions and more, MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis is very good with finance facts, and just so happens to be a very nice man, too (see: his heartbreaking Desert Island Discs episode, complete with hilariously terrible music choices). Over a particularly turbulent few years, Lewis has answered his followers’ questions with empathy, and while he never tries to sugarcoat the state of the economy he is always honest on what he thinks about government policies. Asylum Speakers Podcast with Jaz O’Hara: Stories of Migration Activist Jaz O’Hara is first and foremost clear on one thing in this podcast: these aren’t stories about refugees, but rather they are stories about people.
