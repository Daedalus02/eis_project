Photograph: Apple Apple This article is more than 7 months old iOS 16 release: everything you need to know about Apple’s big update This article is more than 7 months old Free software upgrades for iPhone and Watch that revamp the lockscreen, add new watchfaces, can unsend messages and more due for release Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor Mon 12 Sep 2022 07.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 12 Sep 2022 07.01 BST Apple plans to release software updates for its iPhone and smartwatch on Monday, adding new features and designs for compatible devices. Announced at the firm’s developer conference in June, iOS 16 and watchOS 9 totally change the lockscreen, attempt to destroy the much maligned password, revamp notifications, and add new watchfaces, new running statistics and more. Here’s what you need to know about the updates. When can I get it? Downloads for iOS and watchOS updates usually start at about 6pm UK time (1pm in New York; 3am in Sydney). Unlike other manufacturers, all eligible Apple devices will be able to download and install the update the moment it is released rather than in a staggered fashion. Updates for Apple’s iPad range will be available later in the year. Which devices can get it? All Apple smartphones from 2017’s iPhone 8 or newer can install iOS 16. All Apple Watches from the 2018’s Series 4 or newer can install watchOS 9. How do I get it? Open the Settings app on an iPhone then navigate to General &gt; Software Update. Tap install if available to download, verify and then reboot to install. You can also install the update via a Mac or iTunes on a Windows computer. WatchOS 9 requires an iPhone 8 or later to be running iOS 16 first. Then open the Watch app and navigate to General &gt; Software Update to begin the installation. You will need to put the smartwatch on its charger to complete the update. How much will it cost? The update is free from Apple. If you are being asked to pay for an update, it is likely to be a scam. iOS 16 New lockscreen design The redesigned lockscreen adds more information and better notification stacking for a more modern design. Photograph: Apple The lockscreen has been revamped, with much greater personalisation and a change in the way notifications are displayed. By default it now displays the date, time and a row of information widgets at the top with notifications filing in groups from the bottom of the screen. You can change the typeface and colour of the time, add other information alongside the date, and customise the wallpaper with a 3D effect for some images or a slideshow of photos. Live activities, such as sports scores or music playing, sit above the notification stack at the bottom of the screen, making them easier to reach with one hand. You can also have multiple lockscreens and tie them to focus modes so that you could, for instance, have one for work and one for personal time. New “focus filters” can hide distracting content from apps, such as blocking messages from work colleagues when off the clock. Passkeys Digital keys authenticated by your face or fingerprint on an iPhone can be used to sign into websites, apps and services instead of using a password. It will work on non-Apple products, such as logging into a smart TV by scanning a QR code with the iPhone and then confirming with your face or finger. Passkeys are synced using iCloud Keychain and can be recovered if you lose or break your iPhone. Edit iMessages and unsend from Mail Sent messages can now be edited or removed, for example when you’ve sent something to the wrong group, within the first 15 minutes. You can also mark messages as unread for later, as you might an email. Search in the Mail app has been improved and you can now cancel the sending of an email within 10 seconds. Mail will also pop up a warning if you forget to attach something to an email or fail to add a recipient using machine learning. Automatically cut out objects from images Objects can be isolated from their backgrounds and copied from images in the photos, screenshots, previews, Safari and others. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian You can copy objects from the foreground of images, such as pets, plants, people and products and then paste or share them into other apps, documents or messages. This is in addition to identifying, copying text and other elements, but requires an iPhone XS or newer. You can also type and dictate at the same time on the keyboard, and insert emojis via voice. The translate app can also use the camera to live translate text or find text in photos. Faster security updates Apple has decoupled security updates from full iOS updates, allowing it to release bug fixes faster and have them automatically install on user iPhones. Face ID will also now work when the phone is held in landscape orientation. Watch OS 9 New watch faces and revamped old ones Three new watch faces and revamps of old ones with new colours and rich complications are included. Photograph: Apple Three new watch faces are available. Metropolitan is an analogue face with more customisation options, Playtime is a digital face from artist Joi Fulton, and Lunar includes the phases of the moon. Astronomy has been revamped, while you can now set coloured backgrounds on modular compact, modular and X-Large. Notifications no longer take over the screen when you’re actively using it, appearing as smaller banners that can be expanded as they do on an iPhone. Apps running in the background are more prominent in the dock, while the calendar app has been revamped for better week and day views. More running metrics and better workouts More running metrics, including power, and better summaries add to the Apple Watch’s fitness focus. Photograph: Apple The workout app has several enhancements. The watch can record running power without an accessory, and can show more metrics such as stride length, ground contact time, vertical oscillation and heart rate zones. Workouts can be customised too, for intervals and other bits with alerts for pace, heart rate, cadence and power. Automatic transitions between running, cycling and swimming are now supported for multisport, while enhanced workout summaries provide more detail at the end. Medication and sleep The health app can now remind you to take medications and keep a log straight from the wrist. Sleep tracking is also improved, with stages and comparison charts in the app on the iPhone.

Photograph: Jorge Perez/Alamy iOS This article is more than 10 months old I am not a robot: iOS verification update marks end of ‘captchas’ This article is more than 10 months old Tests where you are asked to spot traffic lights or type out wobbly letters may be a thing of the past Alex Hern Technology editor @alexhern Tue 21 Jun 2022 10.47 BSTLast modified on Wed 22 Jun 2022 05.09 BST An annoyance, an important security feature, an uncomfortable existential request: however you feel about being asked to prove you are not a robot, it has become a daily occurrence for most of us, but perhaps not one we would miss. A new feature in the upcoming versions of iOS and macOS, Apple’s operating systems for iPhones and computers, promises to give the boot to “captchas” once and for all. Called “automatic verification”, the technology will allow sites to verify you are not a robot without you having to do anything at all. Captchas – that’s “completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart” – are the little tests you sometimes see when signing up to a website to help stop fraud. It may ask you to spot all the traffic lights in a picture, or type out some wobbly looking letters and numbers. If you get it wrong, it may ask you to start again, leading you to wonder if you really know what a traffic light looks like – or if you might be a robot after all. “You likely don’t enjoy being interrupted by these,” said Apple’s Tommy Pauly. “I certainly don’t. The reason these experiences exist is to prevent fraudulent activity. If you run a server, you don’t want it to be overwhelmed by fraud. Some attempts to create accounts or buy products come from legitimate users. But other attempts may be from attackers or bots.” The company worked with Fastly and Cloudflare, two companies that operate the infrastructure level of much of the public internet, to build the feature. It relies on the same sort of technology that underpins Apple’s efforts to replace passwords across the internet, and works by allowing your device to send an encrypted statement confirming it is being used by a human over to the requesting website. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Although the service is tied in to Apple’s iCloud network, the requesting site will not receive any personal information about the user or their device. While Apple is the first to push such a technology to users themselves, the basic idea has been used by Google, which helped develop the standard and has built a similar system into Chrome. But Google’s version is so far focused on letting third parties build their own Captcha replacements, rather than ending the technology altogether. In fact, Google may even lose out from the shift: since the company bought a startup called reCaptcha in 2009, it has used the human input from the tests as part of its training data for large machine-learning projects, first asking people to help it transcribe scanned books and later using the responses to train its machine-vision systems about road features in order to perfect its self-driving car projects.

Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters TikTok This article is more than 8 months old TikTok can track users’ every tap as they visit other sites through iOS app, new research shows This article is more than 8 months old Researcher says social media app can collect keystroke information but ‘there is no way for us to know’ if or how data is used Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates Get our free news app, morning email briefing or daily news podcast Rafqa Touma @At_Raf_ Wed 24 Aug 2022 05.45 BSTLast modified on Wed 24 Aug 2022 05.47 BST TikTok has the ability to track every tap of your screen while you browse in its iOS app, including typed passwords and clicked links, according to new research by software engineer Felix Krause. In-app browsing refers to any activity on third-party sites that open in the app, rather than in an external window. On Thursday, Krause released a report examining the JavaScript code social media platforms inject into third-party sites that allow it to track the activity of users. Krause’s security tool, InAppBrowser.com, revealed the TikTok iOS app has the ability to monitor all keystrokes, text inputs and screen taps, which could include sensitive personal data like credit card information and passwords. Krause noted, though, that “just because an app injects JavaScript into external websites, doesn’t mean the app is doing anything malicious”. “There is no way for us to know the full details on what kind of data each in-app browser collects, or how – or if – the data is being transferred or used,” he said. When opening a website from within the TikTok iOS app, they inject code that can observe every keyboard input (which may include credit card details, passwords or other sensitive information) TikTok also has code to observe all taps, like clicking on any buttons or links. pic.twitter.com/Dcv0N4ccKD — Felix Krause (@KrauseFx) August 18, 2022 Priyadarsi Nanda of the University of Technology Sydney’s School of Electrical and Data Engineering said collecting information about keystrokes closely resembles the behaviour of keyloggers, a type of malware. “Whichever website you go to, it takes your inputs,” he said. “This is definitely a concern for any app you don’t trust.” A TikTok spokesperson told Guardian Australia the “report’s conclusions about TikTok are incorrect and misleading”. “The researcher specifically says the JavaScript code does not mean our app is doing anything malicious, and admits they have no way to know what kind of data our in-app browser collects,” the spokesperson said. “Contrary to the report’s claims, we do not collect keystroke or text inputs through this code, which is solely used for debugging, troubleshooting, and performance monitoring.” Besides TikTok, Krause assessed the iOS apps of Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Amazon, Snapchat and Robinhood. TikTok was the only app found not to offer users the option of switching from in-app browsing to an external browser when accessing third-party sites. https://t.co/KwZ3dtKyQf - a new tool I used to investigate the in-app browsers of apps (that use them) to look for any external JavaScript code being injected. pic.twitter.com/XSdXOpXYlq — Felix Krause (@KrauseFx) August 18, 2022 “TikTok had the most extensive surveillance capabilities,” Uri Gal, professor of business information systems at the University of Sydney, said. “Many people who use the app are unaware of the surveillance conducted about them within [it]. The user base of TikTok is by far younger than Facebook’s and Instagram’s … that makes them much more vulnerable.” Gal said TikTok “presents a different kind of risk” because of parent company ByteDance’s suspected ties to the Chinese Communist party. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The surveillance functionality could be used to “gather as much information as possible for industrial espionage purposes, and shaping public opinion that is more toward their interests,” he said. A report released by Australian-US cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0 in July warned the Chinese government could use the app to harvest personal information, from in-app messages to device locations. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Guardian Australia&apos;s Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Krause’s research found Instagram also has the ability to track screen taps, such as when users click on an image. “There are data privacy and integrity issues when you use in-app browsers … such as how Instagram and TikTok show all external websites inside their app,” Krause wrote in the report. Meta injecting code into websites to track its users, research says Read more Gal said Instagram and Facebook’s practices are almost as extensive as TikTok’s. “Their primary motivation is almost purely commercial and financial, whereas with TikTok, there is a national security element that I don’t think is directly present with the others.” A spokesperson for Instagram’s parent company, Meta, said “in-app web browsers are common across the industry”. “At Meta, we use in-app browsers to enable safe, convenient, and reliable experiences, such as making sure auto-fill populates properly or preventing people from being redirected to malicious sites,” the spokesperson said. “Adding any of these kinds of features requires additional code. We have carefully designed these experiences to respect users’ privacy choices, including how data may be used for ads.” In a statement from TikTok included in Krause’s report, spokesperson Maureen Shanahan said: “Like other platforms, we use an in-app browser to provide an optimal user experience … like checking how quickly a page loads or whether it crashes.” Nanda said the social media platforms do not disclose how much personal data remains with the company or whether it is shared with third parties. “They can pass on that information to third party service providers, which is instrumental in launching sophisticated attacks of any nature,” Nanda said, pointing to hacks that steal data such as credit card information, and malware attacks that freeze computers or lock files. “That is the real risk.” Topics TikTok Social media Instagram Facebook Meta Social networking Digital media news Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed World UK Coronavirus Climate crisis Environment Science Global development Football Tech Business Obituaries News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints &amp; corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms &amp; conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2023 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It has unveiled a lower-cost smartphone, high-end earbuds and a watch due later this year, as well as Android updates. During the keynote kicking off its IO developer conference, Google set out its intention to build a broader collection of own-brand devices rather than rely on third parties such as Samsung using its software. “We’re going for the ecosystem,” said Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of consumer hardware. “We want people to know where Google is headed with devices as an organisation over next few years.” Pixel 6a The Pixel 6a is Google’s smaller, cheaper smartphone, but shares the same chips and design as its top phones. Photograph: Google The Pixel 6a is Google’s new smaller, mid-range Android phone, costing from £399 ($449/A$749), shipping on 28 July. It has a 6.1in screen and the same recycled aluminium body, two-tone colours and camera bar across the back as the firm’s high-end phones. It has Google’s top-end Tensor processor, 5G and the Titan M2 security chip from the Pixel 6, with 6GB of memory and 128GB of storage. It will be supported with software updates for at least five years, making it one of the longest-lasting Android phones. The 6a has a pair of wide and ultra-wide 12-megapixel cameras on the back, which support the same improved skin tone and magic eraser features as Google’s top models. Pixel Buds Pro The Pixel Buds Pro are Google’s high-end earbuds with noise cancelling. Photograph: Google Google announced its first Bluetooth earbuds with noise cancelling, called the Pixel Buds Pro, which will ship on 28 July costing £179 ($199/A$299). The earbuds use Google-designed chips, algorithms and speakers, competing directly with Apple’s pricier AirPods Pro. They have IPX4 sweat resistance and the same smart features as Google’s previous earbuds such as hands-free voice assistant, walking directions and instant translation abilities. The Buds Pro can connect to two Bluetooth devices at once, such as a phone for calls and a laptop for music, including iPhones, Macs and PCs. They last up to seven hours with noise cancelling, and up to 20 hours with their charging case. Pixel Watch The Pixel Watch is Google’s long-awaited WearOS smartwatch and a direct challenge to the Apple Watch but for Android. Photograph: Google Google showed off its first own-brand WearOS smartwatch, called the Pixel Watch, which will ship in the autumn. It has a round, domed design, is made of recycled stainless steel, and has optional 4G connectivity. It features various Google apps and services including Assistant, Maps and Pay, and the Play Store for third-party apps. It will also feature a suite of Fitbit health and activity-tracking services, after Google’s purchase of the firm, which completed last year. The watch will work with most Android phones, not just Pixels. Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel Tablet The Pixel 7 and 7 Pro are Google’s upcoming top smartphones, due in the summer. Photograph: Google Google unveiled its upcoming top Pixel 7 and 7 Pro smartphones for later this year. They will feature premium polished aluminium and glass bodies and the firm’s next-generation Tensor processor, shipping with Android 13 in the autumn. Google also announced its intention to return to making Android tablets in 2023 as companions for its Pixel phones. The premium Pixel Tablet will have Google’s Tensor chip and will take advantage of Android 13 with additions for better split-screen multitasking and use of space on tablets, including updates to 20 of Google’s apps, with third-party apps such as TikTok, Zoom, Facebook and others gaining new tablet-optimised designs. Android 13, Maps, Search and Assistant Google’s eco-friendly directions in Maps, which shows the most fuel-efficient routes, is expanding to Europe. Photograph: Google Google showed off some new software features coming later this year, including the ability to request removal of search results containing your contact details, automatic summarisation of key points in Google Docs and Chat, and the ability to speak to Google Assistant just by looking at the Nest Hub Max smart display. Later this year Google Maps will gain a new immersive view, which combines street and aerial images to create digital models of cities including London, Los Angeles and New York. Users will be able to virtually walk through the cities at various times of the day with information overlaid, such as weather conditions, traffic and how busy a place is. Android 13 will also be released in the summer as a free update, bringing with it greater customisation and privacy options including the ability to force apps to ask whether they can send you notifications before doing so, similar to iOS, and further restrictions to location access for apps. Google’s Material You colour theming from Android 12 will be expanded across more of the interface, including custom app icons. Now more than one language can be used on a phone at the same time, such as English in a social media app but Spanish in a banking app. The new Google Wallet will be able to collect payment cards, loyalty cards, transport tickets and boarding cards in one place, with various kinds of identification such as student IDs and driving licences in the US later this year. Users keen to try the new features can test out the software in beta form on Google’s Pixel phones and others from third-party manufacturers.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that the service would first roll out in Australia and New Zealand later this week. The company said it would cost US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android (or, in Australia, $19.99 on web or $24.99 on iOS and Android). Meta to pay more for Mark Zuckerberg’s personal security amid job losses Read more Zuckerberg said in addition to a blue badge the service would offer “extra impersonation protection”, improved reach for verified users and direct access to customer support. In a blog post, Meta said it would rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts, to avoid the embarrassment of accounts impersonating people and brands – as happened when Twitter initially rolled out its paid verification service. Accounts must also have a posting history and users must be at least 18 years old. The service would not be available to businesses at this stage, Meta said. The increased visibility of posts from verified users would “depend on a subscriber’s existing audience size and the topic of their posts”, the company said. Those with smaller audiences might see more of an impact. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The company said it would also offer “exclusive stickers” on Facebook and Instagram stories and Facebook reels. Meta cut 11,000 staff in November – the equivalent of 13% of its workforce – amid falling ad revenue and economic downturn. The company’s share price fell by more than 70% in 2022 before a rebound and in July it reported its first ever fall in revenue. Twitter’s CEO, Elon Musk, responded to the news in a tweet saying it was “inevitable” Meta would follow Twitter. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Guardian Australia&apos;s Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company currently provides free two-factor authentication through third-party apps and a security key, which are considered more secure than SMS-based systems. If non-subscriber accounts that use SMS authentication do not switch before the deadline, Twitter said it would disable two-factor authentication for that account. Twitter data appears to support claims new algorithm inflated reach of Elon Musk’s tweets, Australian researcher says Read more The move has sparked concerns that it could lead to widespread hacks on accounts next month if they fail to switch over. Twitter’s last transparency report prior to Musk’s takeover shows that as of December 2021, although just 2.6% of active Twitter accounts use two-factor authentication, 74.4% of those use SMS as their method of authentication. Musk has claimed Twitter was being “scammed” US$60m a year from fake two-factor authentication messages. He separately supported a tweet claiming the scams were being run by telecommunications companies that had set up bot accounts to run the two-factor authentication process to get revenue from the text messages from Twitter.

How to avoid major plot reveals on the internet and social media With new episodes of Succession airing in the middle of the workday, Australian viewers are particularly vulnerable to being spoiled Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email Alyx Gorman @AlyxG Tue 11 Apr 2023 08.18 BSTLast modified on Wed 12 Apr 2023 00.16 BST My flatmate and I had a special Monday morning ritual during the spring of 2019. We would set our alarms for 6am, draw the blinds in our little London flat and watch Game of Thrones. She was a subeditor charged with proofing episode recaps, I was running a social media team. Ingesting an hour of mud, blood and dragons before our first coffees was the safest way to avoid spoilers. Now that I live in Australia, where big US shows tend to air in the middle of workdays, there are no worms to be caught by early birds. So, like many Australian Succession viewers – at least those of us who didn’t have Easter Monday off work – I knew about the massive plot development in last night’s episode hours before hearing the title score’s dissonant opening chords. Reboot for the linen suit: how Tom from Succession became a style hero Read more Next Monday, many more Australians will suffer the same fate. But is it inevitable? After seeking out the advice of three people who’ve successfully avoided Succession spoilers (through a mixture of tech savvy and common sense) the answer is: kind of. As Cnet’s Daniel Van Boom says: “The options are quite rough, that’s to be sure.” Strategy one: self-control The old-fashioned kind. “The first one is obvious: don’t Google the show,” Van Boom cautions. He has inadvertently spoiled himself a number of times while trying to figure out air times. I tell him I had the ending of John Wick IV ruined by a Google auto-prompt (my search was unrelated to John Wick). Apparently, there are no silver bullets for that. “There’s spoilers at every turn.” Leadership material? Sarah Snook as ‘Shiv’ Roy. Photograph: Home Box Office/©2023 HBO. All Rights Reserved Van Boom also cautions against entertainment websites: “Don’t go to Variety or the Hollywood Reporter … the top story is going to be a spoiler. “But really the killer is going to be social media … just get off it. It’s a wild west in terms of protecting yourself. You’re leaving it up to others and people are not known for their good etiquette on the internet.” All this time and y’all STILL haven’t learnt not to log into Twitter DOT com to avoid seeing spoilers??? Baby that’s on YOU pic.twitter.com/cL9zWAUhfl — Meech (@MediumSizeMeech) April 10, 2023 Strategy two: self-control The new, technologically facilitated kind. If looking at social media or the news is not part of your day job, you can always install time management apps and browser extensions like AppBlock (Android, iOS and Chrome, free with paid premium tiers), Freedom (Android, iOS, Windows and Mac, free with paid premium tiers) or – yes – Self Control (Mac only, free) which will block you from impulse browsing. Van Boom calls this a “radical move”, but a good move nonetheless. “Unfortunately in our time zone, you have to give a little to get a little.” He says he’s generally in favour of people forcing themselves off social media for four or five hours, “and particularly for this”. Strategy three: filter it out If you’re professionally obliged to use the internet, you’ll need to take a more granular approach to skirting spoilers. Michael, who works as a software developer and data specialist, has this one figured out. His family gather weekly for a Succession viewing party – “it’s a family show” – and the vagaries of coordinating between five adults means screenings sometime happen several days after the show has aired. He uses a Firefox browser extension called Spoiler Protection 2.0 (also available for Chrome) which allows you to block certain keywords while you browse. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Michael also suggests telling YouTube not to spoil you via thumbnails, by using Google’s “don’t recommend channel” feedback tool. Van Boom says Twitter is quite good for dodging spoilers. In the privacy and safety settings, you can mute certain particular hashtags and words – “Succession”, let’s say, or “Roy” – from your feed. Succession: why do we love watching the super-rich? Pop Culture with Chanté Joseph Read more But the rest of social media is a minefield. Facebook does not offer muted keyword options. On Instagram, you can mute words on suggested posts but not posts from people you already follow. Van Boom says his cousin successfully avoided Game of Thrones spoilers for years, only to have the ending ruined by Snoop Dogg during an Instagram live broadcast. On TikTok you can filter out specific video keywords and hashtags in content preferences settings, but this won’t stop untagged spoilers from making it to your For You page. Van Boom also suggests turning off push notifications from news websites (especially critical for sports spoilers) and temporarily unsubscribing from any “potentially sensitive” email newsletters. Of course, none of these measures will prevent you from being spoiled offline, but at least if that happens, it’ll be someone else’s fault. Strategy four: stop caring ABC Shepparton breakfast show host and former tech reporter, Nic Healey, advocates for a more philosophical approach. “I feel like the whole fear around spoilers peaked a few years ago … But it’s been really intriguing watching Succession. It’s not about your traditional spoilers, it’s that people are on the edge of their seat.” He says streaming has changed things since Game of Thrones, when Australians would illegally torrent a show they were already paying for, just to watch it a few hours earlier. This week marked the most important episode of Succession ever. Let the games begin Read more “If you watch a show like Succession, it’s not ruining the show. It’s not ruining the craft … If a show can be ruined by a single piece of information, have a think about whether it’s a good show after all. “Pre Game of Thrones, no one was agitated about hearing what would happen on an episode of The Wire, because we just watched it whenever we damn well felt like. “Bank up a few episodes. Don’t be a slave to the release schedules … It’s been a while since we’ve had a show that’s been this much of a phenomenon. We can still chart a shining path forward.” Van Boom endorses this strategy too. He knows what happened on Succession yesterday, but he hasn’t started watching the show yet. “And by the time I watch it, I will have forgotten.” Topics Australian lifestyle Succession Television HBO news Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Fashion Food Recipes Love &amp; sex Health &amp; fitness Home &amp; garden Women Men Family Travel Money News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints &amp; corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms &amp; conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2023 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

More than a decade after Facebook updated its patented News Feed to default to showing “top stories” rather than a chronological list of posts from friends and pages, the company is restoring the ability to “easily see the most recent posts from your friends, Pages and groups”. Facebook is splitting the feed over two tabs on its iOS and Android apps – Feeds and Home. “One of the most requested features for Facebook is to make sure people don’t miss friends’ posts,” Mark Zuckerberg said in a post announcing the feature, “so today we’re launching a Feeds tab where you can see posts from your friends, groups, Pages and more separately in chronological order. “The app will still open to a personalised feed on the Home tab, where our discovery engine will recommend the content we think you’ll care most about. But the Feeds tab will give you a way to customise and control your experience further.” The Feeds tab will let users curate a subsection of the pages, groups and friends they follow to appear on the chronological view. The idea is that the Home tab, with its aggressive algorithmic curation, can become “more of a discovery engine for you to find and follow new content and creators through recommendations”, the company says, while Feeds “provides an easy way to access the content from the people and communities you’re already connected with on Facebook”. The change has implications for Facebook’s bottom line: adverts are included in the Feeds tab but “suggested for you” posts are not, increasing the value of paying for “reach” on the site as opposed to trying to grow “organically” by gaming the site’s algorithms. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Much will remain unchanged, however. The Home tab will continue to be the main view for users when they first open the Facebook app, and it will contain Reels, the site’s clone of TikTok, and Stories, its clone of Snapchat’s ephemeral video feature, along the top. “Your Home tab is uniquely personalised to you through our machine learning ranking system,” the company said. “This system takes into account thousands of signals to help cut through the clutter and rank content in the order we think you will find most valuable. We’re investing in AI to best serve recommended content in this ranked experience. “While Home is where you’ll increasingly find community through your passions and interests, you can continue to stay up to date on the people and communities you care about most in Feeds.” The new tabs will begin appearing on the Facebook app from Thursday and will roll out globally over the next week. The change is one of the most significant to come to the News Feed since the switch to algorithmic sorting in 2011. The feed itself, borrowed from sites such as Twitter and Flickr but patented by Facebook in 2010, was wildly controversial when it was first introduced in 2006, with users arguing it was a privacy violation to group previously hidden information such as posts, photos and likes in one easy view. But its popularity soon won out, and a news feed rapidly became standard for almost every social network.

The move follows a botched revamp of the service last month that resulted in a host of impersonator accounts appearing on the platform as some users took advantage of the chance to launch bogus “verified” accounts for major companies and public figures. Twitter said: “We’re relaunching @TwitterBlue on Monday – subscribe on web for $8/month or on iOS for $11/month to get access to subscriber-only features, including the blue checkmark.” we’re relaunching @TwitterBlue on Monday – subscribe on web for $8/month or on iOS for $11/month to get access to subscriber-only features, including the blue checkmark 🧵 pic.twitter.com/DvvsLoSO50 — Twitter (@Twitter) December 10, 2022 It added that users willing to pay $8 on the web or $11 a month via Apple’s app store would get more prominence on the platform than non-payers, promising that subscribers would “rocket to the top of replies, mentions and search”.

Twitter said giving priority to subscribers would help combat “scams and spam”, referring to one of the bugbears of the platform’s owner, Elon Musk, who attempted to walk away from a deal to buy the business because of his concerns over vexatious automated accounts. Subscribers who attempt to change their handle, display name or photo will temporarily lose their tick until the account is reviewed again, Twitter said. Other features offered to subscribers include the ability to edit tweets. According to a trial launched by the company in September, shortly before Musk bought Twitter, users will be able to edit a tweet up to 30 minutes after it is published – with a symbol showing it has been modified. Other planned new features include offering half the number of adverts and the ability to post longer tweets. The company also confirmed that it would introduce a colour-coded verification scheme, with businesses receiving a gold tick or checkmark and government accounts receiving a grey symbol. Twitter did not explain why Apple users were being charged more than others on the web but Musk has been openly critical of the fees charged in its app store, which takes a cut of up to 30% on sales. In a series of tweets last month, he accused Apple of threatening to block Twitter from its app store for unspecified reasons and also said the iPhone maker had stopped advertising on the social media platform. However, after a subsequent meeting with Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, he tweeted that the misunderstanding about Twitter being removed from Apple’s app store had been resolved. Musk has made clear that he wants Twitter to be less dependent on advertising, which accounted for 90% of its $5.1bn in revenues last year. That need has become more urgent after the Tesla chief executive reported a “massive drop in revenue” when advertisers withdrew from the platform amid concerns about content moderation, with the outbreak of “verified” impostor accounts exacerbating those concerns.

Photograph: Pavlo Gonchar/Sopa/Rex/Shutterstock Technology Google allows app developers to break away from Play billing system UK regulator asks for views on how move will work in practice, amid concern over tech firm’s cut of in-app purchases Alex Hern UK technology editor @alexhern Wed 19 Apr 2023 13.05 BSTLast modified on Wed 19 Apr 2023 21.14 BST Google is to let Android developers bypass in-app payments on its Play app store for the first time, in an effort to head off an investigation from the British competition regulator. But the specifics of the deal to placate the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will give little cause for cheer to independent developers who have been campaigning against “app store taxes”, since Google will continue to collect a “service fee” for all eligible purchases on its platform. That means the changes will knock just a few percentage points off the bill for those developers who handle their own payments. “Google Play has been the launchpad for millions of apps, helping developers create global businesses that support a quarter of a million jobs in the UK alone,” Google’s legal director, Oliver Bethell, said in a statement. “Today we are announcing a set of potential commitments in relation to our billing policies in the UK to resolve the CMA’s investigation.” Previously, a typical developer who offered digital goods for sale using in-app purchases would have to pay a 30% cut to Google of the sticker price. Now, if they choose not to use Google’s payments services, they will still have to pay a 27% cut of the revenue to Google, plus any fee to their own payment processor, which typically comes in at around 3%. If they offer a choice between Google’s payments and their own, an extra one percentage point discount is applied. In a statement, the CMA’s senior director of antitrust, Ann Pope, cautiously welcomed the commitment. “Google’s complete control over in-app payments raised concerns this unfairly restricted app developers – by forcing them to use Google Play’s billing system – putting distance between them and their customers and reducing competition, to the detriment of Google Play users,” she said. “While we’re pleased our investigation has resulted in Google offering to give in-app payment freedom to thousands of app developers, we need to make sure these commitments will work in practice – so we welcome all feedback, which we will carefully consider before making a final decision.” Both Google and Apple, which faces similar regulatory pressures over its control of the iOS App Store, have offered similar concessions in other jurisdictions around the world. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern&apos;s weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: d3sign/Getty Images New technology being rolled out by Google, Apple and others that requires authentication on devices will prevent phishing, SIM-swap and other methods now used to obtain passwords. Photograph: d3sign/Getty Images Google Google rolls out passkey technology in ‘beginning of the end’ for passwords Apple and Microsoft also collaborated on the technology which allows authentication with fingerprint ID, facial ID or a pin Josh Taylor @joshgnosis Thu 4 May 2023 08.28 BSTLast modified on Thu 4 May 2023 08.51 BST Google is moving one step closer to ditching passwords, rolling out its passkey technology to Google accounts from Thursday. The passkey is designed to replace passwords entirely by allowing authentication with fingerprint ID, facial ID or pin on the phone or device you use for authentication. Apple has begun using the technology in iOS16 and the latest MacOS release, and Microsoft has been using it through the Authenticator app. AI ‘could be as transformative as Industrial Revolution’ Read more Users can create a passkey for each device they use, or the operating system or app used to manage the passkeys can be shared between the devices. A cryptographic private key is stored on the device, and there is a corresponding public key uploaded to Google. When a user signs in, the device must solve a unique challenge using the private key to generate a signature. The signature is then verified using the public key to allow a person to access their account. All Google sees out of the transaction is the signature generated, and the public key. Google has said this will prevent people using phishing, SIM-swap and other methods to obtain passwords and bypass authentication methods – because the private key and the biometrics used are never shared. Google said the rolling out of the passkey technology – to mark World Password Day – signified “the beginning of the end” for passwords for Google accounts. The technology is still in early stages, and it will be a while before there is mass adoption across apps and websites. Google will still let people use passwords in circumstances where they do not have the passkey-enabled device available, but over time the company said it would pay closer attention to accounts using passwords for signs of compromise. Each passkey is unique to each service a person uses, too, meaning that there’s no risk of one compromised account compromising every other account using a passkey. Australian law firm HWL Ebsworth hit by Russian-linked ransomware attack Read more If a user wants to temporarily share their passkey to a new device, they can get a one-time share by scanning a QR code or by using AirDrop for Apple devices. It uses Bluetooth to determine that the device is actually in proximity to the new device. If a user loses their device with the passkey, they can revoke access immediately in account settings. The technology has been developed as part of the Fido (Fast Identity Online) alliance with Apple, Google and Microsoft leading the charge. Ebay, Docusign, PayPal and a number of other businesses are already using passkey. While there may be a time when passkey spells the end of passwords and password managers, 1Password – one of the leading password manager apps – has welcomed the move from the tech giants. The 1Password chief executive, Jeff Shiner, said the move by Google would allow 1.5 billion people in the world to try passkeys but in order to secure wider adoption, passkeys needed to allow users to easily switch between ecosystems such as iOS or Android. “As we actively work with other Fido alliance leaders to eliminate passwords, we’ll inevitably remove one of phishers’ biggest rewards – credentials,” he said. “This is a tipping point for passkeys and making the online world safe.” For companies that use Google for work accounts, the administrators in those businesses will soon be able to enable those users to use passkeys to sign in.

Photograph: Apple Apple’s latest free software update for the iPhone, iPad and Watch adds new features for recognising text in images and faster, local Siri. Photograph: Apple Apple This article is more than 1 year old iOS 15 release: everything you need to know about Apple’s big update This article is more than 1 year old Free software upgrades for iPhone, iPad and Watch improve notifications, Safari, FaceTime and more due for release Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor Mon 20 Sep 2021 11.43 BSTLast modified on Mon 20 Sep 2021 12.14 BST Apple plans to release software updates for its iPhone, iPad and smartwatch on Monday, which will add new features for compatible devices. Announced at the firm’s developer conference in June, iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and WatchOS 8 bring new ways to deal with notifications, tools to keep work and home life separate, the ability to FaceTime video call with non-Apple users and more. Here’s what you need to know about the updates. When can I get it? Downloads for iOS, iPadOS and WatchOS updates usually start at about 6pm UK time (1pm in New York; 3am in Sydney). Unlike other manufacturers, all eligible Apple devices will be able to download and install the update the moment it is released rather than in a staggered fashion. Which devices can get it? All Apple smartphones from 2015’s iPhone 6S or newer, including the first-generation iPhone SE, can install iOS 15. All Apple tablets from 2014’s iPad Air 2, 2015’s iPad mini 4, 2017’s iPad 5th Generation or newer can install iPadOS 15. All Apple Watches from the 2017’s Series 3 or newer can install WatchOS 8. How do I get it? Open the Settings app on an iPhone or iPad then navigate to General &gt; Software Update. Tap install if available to download, verify and then reboot to install. You can also install the update via a Mac or iTunes on a Windows computer. WatchOS 8 requires an iPhone 6s or later to be running iOS 15 first. Then open the Watch app and navigate to General &gt; Software Update to begin the installation. You will need to put the smartwatch on its charger to complete the update. How much will it cost? The update is free from Apple. If you are being asked to pay for an update it is likely to be a scam. iOS 15 Notifications and Focus Focus allows you to set which apps and contacts can notify you and change it on the go, so that you can minimise distractions. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Notifications have been redesigned to be clearer, now with app logos and contact photos. Less important notifications can also be bundled together as a summary and delivered daily at a time of your choosing. The biggest change is a feature called Focus. You can create profiles, such as work, home and personal, and set which contacts and apps are allowed to notify you based on the profile so that personal messages do not interrupt work and vice-versa. Each profile can also have a custom home screen so that activating the work Focus mode shows only a pane of work-related apps, for instance. People contacting you in Messages will be told that you have silenced notifications and can choose to notify you anyway if it is urgent. Third-party messaging apps can be updated to support the feature too. Safari redesign Safari’s redesign makes reaching the address bar and controls with one hand a lot easier. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The controls, address and tab bar in Safari have been moved to the bottom of the screen. Tabs can be grouped and saved while you can swipe left and right to switch between them. The old style “single tab” interface with the address bar at the top of the screen is still available as an option. You can voice search straight from the address bar and install extensions similar to Safari on the desktop. The browser will now block known trackers from profiling you using your IP address and automatically upgrade to encrypted web traffic when available. FaceTime with non-Apple users Apple’s FaceTime video calling service can now be used on Android and Windows PCs. Apple users can share a link to join a call from a browser without an account. Calls are still end-to-end encrypted. FaceTime now has a grid view for up to six people, background blurring, background noise reduction – and now it will sound like someone is speaking from the same side of the screen as their video in group calls. Live text and visual look up Live text works just like Google’s longstanding Lens feature. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian You can now perform live text and handwriting recognition in photos and the camera app, or point the camera at different objects to recognise them for more information, including pets, nature, art, books and landmarks. Spotlight search can now look through your photos and find text in images. It can also search the web for images and presents richer results for music, movies and TV shows more like a Google search or Spotlight on a Mac. Shared health Apple’s Health app can now share data with friends, family and carers, allowing users to share specific information such as activity and heart rate. Health can notify those keeping an eye on loved ones when significant changes occur, such as a sudden decrease in activity, or when irregular heartbeat or arrhythmia is detected. There’s also a “walking steadiness” measurement that can warn of the risk of falling if your balance changes. Faster Siri and privacy upgrades Similar to Google’s Assistant, Siri can now process voice requests locally on the iPhone rather than sending the audio to a server for interpretation. It improves privacy, is significantly faster and works offline for many features such as setting timers. Apple Mail can block email tracking while the new app privacy report shows how often apps have accessed certain features such as location, your photos, camera and contacts, plus when apps have contacted third-party domains such as trackers. iPadOS 15 Apple’s tablets gain all the features in iOS 15, including focus state that syncs across all your Apple devices and the translate app, plus a few bespoke to iPadOS 15. Photograph: Apple Improved multitasking The little multitasking menu at the top of the screen is much easier to use. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The way you place two apps side by side for multitasking has become a lot easier. Tap the new three-dot menu at the top of the screen to put the current app in full screen, split-view or slide-over then select a second app from the home screen. You can also arrange the apps by dragging them on to one another from the app switcher menu. The app library from iOS 14 has been added to the dock on iPadOS, while widgets can be placed directly on the home screen, which reduces the number of icons you can have on screen compared with the previous Today View widget layout. Safari redesign Safari on the iPad looks and works more like a desktop browser with extensions and a new tab bar design. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Safari on the iPad has been updated with tab groups, new privacy protections, extensions and a redesigned sidebar. But unlike the iPhone, the address bar is still at the top of the screen with resigned tabs sitting below it that colour match to the site you are browsing. Quick Notes Quickly jot down a note or save a URL to Apple’s Notes app by swiping up from the bottom right corner of the screen. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Swipe up from the bottom right corner of the screen to bring up a Post-it-style quick note. It will automatically add links from the site or app you are using, including text or images in Safari. You can then type or handwrite with the stylus. Keyboard shortcuts Press and hold the command (cmd) key to show all the available keyboard shortcuts in any given app. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Using an external keyboard with an iPad has been much improved. The tool bar at the bottom of the screen is more compact and you can navigate within apps by jumping through text fields and buttons with the tab key, as you might on a computer. There are lots of new keyboard shortcuts, such as access to multitasking views, the app switcher, control centre and notifications. WatchOS 8 also gains focus, notification improvements, keys and other parts of iOS 15, plus a few specific improvements.

Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA TikTok This article is more than 2 months old Under-18 TikTok users to be limited to one hour – until they change settings This article is more than 2 months old Default settings being rolled out have 60 and 100-minute restrictions but can be removed Alex Hern UK technology editor @alexhern Wed 1 Mar 2023 16.53 GMTLast modified on Wed 1 Mar 2023 21.30 GMT Teenagers joining TikTok will be limited to an hour of use each day, the social media company has announced – but only for as long as it takes them to realise they can change the settings manually. New default screen time restrictions will be enabled for every account known to belong to someone under 18, the company says. After the first hour’s use each day, the app will warn them their time is up, “so it’s easier to log off”. But parents praying for an intervention – or young people struggling with their own compulsive behaviour – might find the relief is shortlived, since the restriction can be altered or removed altogether in the app’s settings. If the user removes the limit and then goes on to use the app for more than 100 minutes a day, it will prompt them to set a new restriction, which TikTok says will at least require them to make an active decision on their continued usage. Parents wanting restrictions that cannot be overridden can make use of the app’s “family pairing” features, allowing them to link their own TikTok account to their child’s. These have been updated to allow a more rigorous restriction to be set. With a family pairing account, parents can set a custom screen-time limit for their children that cannot be overridden. They can also set a custom schedule to mute notifications, ensuring their children are not disturbed late at night. “While there’s no collectively endorsed position on how much screen time is ‘too much’, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognise that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,” said Cormac Keenan, the company’s head of trust and safety. “Research also shows that being more aware of how we spend our time can help us be more intentional about the decisions we make, and this is especially important but typically more difficult for younger audiences.” Social networks have a strong motivation to offer their own screen-time controls, in case people decide to activate the stricter controls built into both the iOS and Android smartphone platforms. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern&apos;s weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
