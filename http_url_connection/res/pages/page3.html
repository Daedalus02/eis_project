Ukrainian security service has given details of eight men of military age who had tried to leave Ukraine to avoid serving in the armed forces. It said that a group was charging up to $7,000 (£5,600) to help people illegally cross the border, including with false documents. Ten have been arrested in total across Ukraine. One was a taxman in the Poltava oblast who sold fake medical certificates, and another in Kharkiv is suspected of helping people evade military service by posing as business travellers for defence firms. Other schemes to smuggle people out include disguising them as truck drivers, the SBU reports."},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"http://schema.org","@id":"644a9c368f089fb8070f6f98","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.theguardian.com#publisher","name":"The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/31/TheGuardian_AMP.png","width":190,"height":60},"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/theguardian","https://twitter.com/guardian","https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian"]},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"image":["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3129743f61487e4581bd841920d8925","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=c3d39011e547ddfbe80c69cf0aa13115","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=900&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=01ed72370f73c717caa80f2cd3a64f9b","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7677e026d36ed3dbabb2ac416e9828fb"],"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Sullivan","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-sullivan"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Harry Taylor","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/harry-taylor"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jon Henley","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonhenley"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Kate Connolly","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kateconnolly"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Davidson","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-davidson"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Rankin","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jennifer-rankin"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Sabbagh","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh"}],"datePublished":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says","dateModified":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","articleBody":"Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and included a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. The Russian defensive wall runs from Kherson, in Ukraine’s south, to the north-east of the country, spanning more than 500 miles. An autumn counterattack saw Ukrainian forces sweep across the south-east, retaking half of Kherson city. “These defensive lines consist of layered fortifications and trenches,” said Brady Africk at US thinktank American Enterprise Institute. They include anti-tank ditches, raised barriers, lines of pre-fabricated defences known as dragon’s teeth, landmines and trenches for personnel, he told AFP. The Russian objective is “to maintain control over occupied territory and to "},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"http://schema.org","@id":"644a95288f08ac41bd012f52","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.theguardian.com#publisher","name":"The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/31/TheGuardian_AMP.png","width":190,"height":60},"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/theguardian","https://twitter.com/guardian","https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian"]},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"image":["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3129743f61487e4581bd841920d8925","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=c3d39011e547ddfbe80c69cf0aa13115","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=900&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=01ed72370f73c717caa80f2cd3a64f9b","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7677e026d36ed3dbabb2ac416e9828fb"],"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Sullivan","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-sullivan"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Harry Taylor","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/harry-taylor"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jon Henley","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonhenley"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Kate Connolly","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kateconnolly"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Davidson","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-davidson"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Rankin","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jennifer-rankin"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Sabbagh","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh"}],"datePublished":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says","dateModified":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","articleBody":"More from Vladimir Putin’s speech at the launch of a Russian-built nuclear power plant in Turkey on Thursday. Putin praised the leadership of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ahead of an election where Erdoğan is running to be re-elected. Erdoğan, 69, suspended all campaigning for Turkey’s pivotal presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May after falling ill while conducting a live TV interview on Tuesday. While a member of Nato and sending arms to Ukraine, Turkey has maintained ties to Russia during the war and has hosted discussions between both sides. The Russian president spoke virtually at the launch of a Russian-built nuclear plant in Turkey, using the opportunity to heap praise on Erdoğan, saying Moscow was ready to “extend the hand of friendship”. Putin said the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, Turkey’s first, was a “convincing example of how much you, President Erdoğan, are doing for your country, for the growth of its economy,

Melnyk, who returned to Ukraine in October as deputy foreign minister, was perceived as something of a thorn in the side of the government of Olaf Scholz for his frequent interventions in debates on Ukraine, which he himself describes as “often undiplomatic”. He said he regretted he was no longer able to use his influence on Berlin. “A year ago we were powerful participants in the debate, and even steering it. But my successor does it differently,” he said. “Now we’re simply swimming with the current, letting ourselves"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"http://schema.org","@id":"644a6d5c8f0802b5b51df5f0","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.theguardian.com#publisher","name":"The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/31/TheGuardian_AMP.png","width":190,"height":60},"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/theguardian","https://twitter.com/guardian","https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian"]},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"image":["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3129743f61487e4581bd841920d8925","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=c3d39011e547ddfbe80c69cf0aa13115","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=900&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=01ed72370f73c717caa80f2cd3a64f9b","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7677e026d36ed3dbabb2ac416e9828fb"],"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Sullivan","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-sullivan"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Harry Taylor","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/harry-taylor"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jon Henley","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonhenley"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Kate Connolly","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kateconnolly"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Davidson","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-davidson"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Rankin","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jennifer-rankin"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Sabbagh","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh"}],"datePublished":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says","dateModified":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","articleBody":"Here’s some analysis of President Xi and President Zelenskiy’s call on Wednesday by our correspondent Helen Davidson in Taipei, and why it may have been hastened by problematic comments about sovereignty by a Chinese ambassador. A long-awaited phone call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been cautiously welcomed, but China analysts say the timing suggests it could be partly an act of damage control after controversial comments by China’s ambassador to France. Ambassador Lu Shaye, one of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats with a history of fiery remarks, caused outrage across Europe this week when he denied the sovereignty of former Soviet states, saying they “did not have effective status”. The comments were roundly condemned, with several European nations summoning Chinese envoys for rebuke, and politicians suggesting it demonstrated China’s untrustworthiness as a neutral party in the Ukraine war. Beijing, which counts Russia as its closest major ally, has sought to present"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"http://schema.org","@id":"644a63e68f084a2f5d011846","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.theguardian.com#publisher","name":"The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/31/TheGuardian_AMP.png","width":190,"height":60},"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/theguardian","https://twitter.com/guardian","https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian"]},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"image":["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3129743f61487e4581bd841920d8925","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=c3d39011e547ddfbe80c69cf0aa13115","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=900&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=01ed72370f73c717caa80f2cd3a64f9b","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7677e026d36ed3dbabb2ac416e9828fb"],"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Sullivan","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-sullivan"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Harry Taylor","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/harry-taylor"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jon Henley","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonhenley"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Kate Connolly","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kateconnolly"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Davidson","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-davidson"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Rankin","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jennifer-rankin"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Sabbagh","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh"}],"datePublished":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says","dateModified":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","articleBody":"Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. Lavrov led a session of the UN security council on multilateralism, in which he said the world was at its most dangerous since the cold war. He had requested to bring journalists with him from Russia, but they were barred from entering the US. “It was particularly emphasised [to the US diplomat] that such sabotage, intended to prevent normal journalistic work, would not go unanswered,” the foreign ministry said in its statement. Gerschkovich has previously been visited by Lynne Tracy, the US ambassador to Russia. The visit would have taken place on 11 May.

He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. “I invited His Holiness to visit Ukraine in person,” Shmyhal told reporters at the Foreign Press Association in Rome a few hours after the papal audience. He said he had discussed with the 86-year-old pope the peace plan proposed by Volodymyr Zelenskiy to end the war sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. This included “discussing in a little more detail the different steps the Vatican could take” to help Kyiv achieve its goals, the prime minister said, speaking through an Italian translator. “For example, I asked for the participation, the assistance from the Vatican, from His Holiness, for the return to Ukraine of children, some of whom were orphaned, who were taken away by force, mainly to Russia.” More than 16,000 Ukrainian children ha"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"http://schema.org","@id":"644a5ec68f08e51b9ca016c6","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.theguardian.com#publisher","name":"The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/31/TheGuardian_AMP.png","width":190,"height":60},"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/theguardian","https://twitter.com/guardian","https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian"]},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"image":["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3129743f61487e4581bd841920d8925","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=c3d39011e547ddfbe80c69cf0aa13115","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&height=900&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=01ed72370f73c717caa80f2cd3a64f9b","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d2a73f8388f82afa40db79168c1e9d534cd448/0_172_8251_4951/master/8251.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7677e026d36ed3dbabb2ac416e9828fb"],"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Sullivan","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-sullivan"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Harry Taylor","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/harry-taylor"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jon Henley","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonhenley"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Kate Connolly","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kateconnolly"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Helen Davidson","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-davidson"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Rankin","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jennifer-rankin"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Sabbagh","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh"}],"datePublished":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says","dateModified":"2023-04-27T17:19:00.000Z","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","articleBody":"Russia is not planning to take the path of nuclear escalation in its standoff with the west over Ukraine but others should not test its patience, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

class="dcr-n6w1lc">A resolution on “deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators” passed with 87 votes in favour, meaning an overwhelming majority. One representative voted against and another abstained.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">In its resolution, the assembly called for “immediate and urgent action to be taken to halt the practices of unlawful forcible transfer and deportation currently being carried out by the Russian Federation against the Ukrainian population, and especially its policy and practices relating to the removal of children from their families and homes and their subsequent absorption into Russian citizenship, identity and culture.”</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">It added: “The assembly highlights the need for the recording and monitoring of individual cases, both in order to permit mechanisms for rapid redress, and to collect evidence of accountability in order to bring the perpetrators, at all levels of responsibility, to justice.”</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">The assembly called for the practice to stop “immediately and unconditionally”. It also demanded Russia give access to NGOs and charities, as well as information about where the children now are.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">The international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> in March in relation to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/vladimir-putin-arrest-warrant-ukraine-war-crimes" data-link-name="in body link">the “unlawful deportation” of minors</a>.

An autumn counterattack saw Ukrainian forces sweep across the south-east, retaking half of Kherson city.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">“These defensive lines consist of layered fortifications and trenches,” said Brady Africk at US thinktank American Enterprise Institute.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">They include anti-tank ditches, raised barriers, lines of pre-fabricated defences known as dragon’s teeth, landmines and trenches for personnel, he told AFP.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">The Russian objective is “to maintain control over occupied territory and to attempt to limit Ukraine’s ability to conduct a counteroffensive”, he said.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Moscow’s strategy is to be able to “absorb any attack”, said Pierre Razoux at the Mediterranean Foundation of Strategic Studies, a French research body.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">“The attackers are likely to get stuck by the time they reach the second layer, and even if they get past it, the third is going to be very hard to breach,” he said.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Russia will employ the time-honoured strategy of channelling attacking enemy troops onto ground of their choosing, said Andrew Galer at British strategy thinktank Janes.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">But Ukraine meanwhile gets to decide where to attack Russian lines, he said, adding that Kyiv may not have made its choice yet.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Ukraine could well try to mislead Russia with a small-scale attack to pull defending forces there, and then direct the main attack elsewhere, he said.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Vassily Kashin, at the HSE university in Moscow, said Ukraine could pick the region of Bakhmut where battles have raged for 10 months for its attack, but acknowledged that “the data we have are very limited”.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Kashin said the balance of forces at the front is changing in favour of Russia. “Ukraine can try to change this with a last desperate blow,” he said.</p><footer

rejected a bid by the <strong>US</strong> embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter <strong>Evan Gershkovich</strong> in prison on 11 May.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Lavrov led a session of the UN security council on multilateralism, in which he said the world was at its most dangerous since the cold war. He had requested to bring journalists with him from Russia, but they were barred from entering the US.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">“It was particularly emphasised [to the US diplomat] that such sabotage, intended to prevent normal journalistic work, would not go unanswered,” the foreign ministry said in its statement.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Gerschkovich has previously been visited by Lynne Tracy, the US ambassador to Russia.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">The visit would have taken place on 11 May. The Kremlin has said it is considering other retaliatory measures against the US over the rejection of visas.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">He was arrested last month in the city of <strong>Ekaterinburg</strong> by Russia.

Shmyhal,</strong> has invited <strong>Pope Francis</strong> to visit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Ukraine</a> during a visit to the Vatican.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Russia</a> by Kremlin forces.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">“I invited His Holiness to visit Ukraine in person,” Shmyhal told reporters at the Foreign Press Association in Rome a few hours after the papal audience.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">He said he had discussed with the 86-year-old pope the peace plan proposed by <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> to end the war sparked by Russia’s invasion last year.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">This included “discussing in a little more detail the different steps the Vatican could take” to help Kyiv achieve its goals, the prime minister said, speaking through an Italian translator.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">“For example, I asked for the participation, the assistance from the Vatican, from His Holiness, for the return to Ukraine of children, some of whom were orphaned, who were taken away by force, mainly to Russia.”</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the February 2022 invasion, according to Kyiv, with many allegedly placed in institutions and foster homes.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Russia denies the allegations, saying instead it has saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">In March, the international criminal court announced an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war crime accusation of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">The pope has repeatedly called for peace in Ukraine, although the Vatican’s attempts to mediate in the conflict have yet to yield any results.</p><p class="dcr-n6w1lc">Shmyhal was in Rome on Wednesday for a conference on how Italian businesses could help with the reconstruction of Ukraine, when he also met with Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni.</p><figure id="94087799-da40-494a-85c3-f58941a0d786"
