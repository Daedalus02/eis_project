Rishi Sunak has asked the Department for Education to “ensure schools are not teaching inappropriate or contested content” in the subject of relationships, sex and health education (RSHE), and will bring forward the review that was already “on the cards for some time”. Sunak confirmed the review, which will apply only to state schools in England, after a Tory MP, Miriam Cates, said children were being exposed to sex education classes that were “age-inappropriate, extreme, sexualising and inaccurate”. The prime minister and the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, are understood to be concerned about the issues raised and will consider whether schools should place clearer limits on the content taught to children, depending on their age. Posing a question to Sunak during prime minister’s questions, Cates said: “Graphic lessons on oral sex, how to choke your partner safely, and 72 genders. This is what passes for relationships and sex education in British schools. “Across the country, children are being subjected to lessons that are age-inappropriate, extreme, sexualising and inaccurate, often using resources from unregulated organisations that are actively campaigning to undermine parents. “This is not a victory for equality – it is a catastrophe for childhood.” Sunak responded: “Our priority should always be the safety and wellbeing of children, and schools should also make curriculum content and materials available to parents. “As a result of all of this, we are bringing forward a review of RSHE statutory guidance and we will start our consultation as soon as possible.” Before PMQs, Cates coordinated a letter to the prime minister that was signed by MPs including Priti Patel, former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke, Jonathan Gullis and Andrea Jenkyns, urging Sunak to launch an independent inquiry into what young children have been asked in lessons concerning how they “feel” about oral and anal sex. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders and a former headteacher, said: “The vast majority of schools are incredibly cautious and sensible about the teaching of RSE and we disagree with the sweeping generalisation and inflammatory rhetoric from Miriam Cates in the Commons. “Schools are doing their best to teach children and young people about things like being safe and respectful relationships in a sensitive and age-appropriate manner, but they are constantly subjected to unhelpful potshots from various individuals and groups. “We welcome the review of relationships and sex education as part of an ongoing process of ensuring that schools and teachers are well supported in delivering this topic, but our understanding is that this review has been on the cards for some time, as one would expect, given that this is a relatively new and very important part of the curriculum.” James Bowen, director of policy for the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “It is hard to be anything other than deeply concerned by this announcement. “The overwhelming majority of schools are doing nothing more than following the government’s own statutory guidance when it comes to relationships and sex education. It is worth remembering that the current curriculum was subject to extensive consultation before it was introduced. “We have seen no evidence to suggest there is a widespread problem with pupils being presented with age-inappropriate materials, and if this were the situation, we would expect it to have been picked up on a case-by-case basis. “There is a real concern that this is a politically motivated review, rather than one based on the reality of what is happening in the vast majority of schools up and down the country.” Topics Schools Trade unions Children Conservatives Personal, social and health education England Education policy news Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Drop in London primary applications puts future of some schools at risk 17 Apr 2023 Sex education overhaul in England based on ‘overblown’ claims, say teachers 31 Mar 2023 Gillian Keegan urged to not let culture wars weaken sex education 24 Mar 2023 Shortage of teachers will be a big maths problem for Rishi Sunak 17 Apr 2023 ‘Anti-maths mindset’ costs UK a huge sum, Rishi Sunak claims 17 Apr 2023 Parents, talk to your sons about Andrew Tate – we teachers can’t take him on alone 14 Feb 2023 Impact of pornography not taught enough in schools in England, survey finds 2 Mar 2023 Parents in Wales lose legal fight against ‘woke’ sex education in primary schools 22 Dec 2022 Welsh education minister hits out at ‘misinformation’ over LGBTQ+ curriculum 23 Dec 2022 Former education ministers attack plan to reduce vocational qualifications 29 Jan 2023 Most viewed Most viewed Education Schools Teachers Universities Students News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email Help Complaints &amp; corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms &amp; conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs Back to top © 2023 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
