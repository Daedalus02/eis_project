    <head>Hunt says government to open immigration for key sectors, but only in ‘short-term’ – business live</head>
    <body>12.55pm BST Jeremy Hunt promised business leaders he would work with them to overcome immigration barriers that prevent foreign skilled workers from filling jobs in the UK. The chancellor told the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) annual conference in London the government was prepared to adapt policy following discussions with business groups to tackle problems in the “short-term”. Since we left the single market we have been pragmatic when it comes to immigration requirements. So for example, we put care homes on the shortage occupation list, some construction industry sectors, and we will keep talking to all of you about where there are short-term challenges. But he emphasised the government’s focus was to support UK workers unable to join the labour force, citing parents excluded from taking up jobs due to the high cost of childcare and people with back problems who have taken early retirement. Immigration has become one of the most fraught topics within the cabinet, with estimates showing net migration may have hit nearly 1m last year. Suella Braverman argued this week that Brits should be trained to drive trucks, work in the meat industry and gather crops as a way of easing labour shortages, rather than businesses relying on migrant labour. Her comments were seen as a rebuff to cabinet colleagues, including Hunt, who have backed easing visa rules as a way to promote economic growth. But BCC director general Shevaun Haviland has said said 80% of BCC members looking to hire staff “are facing real challenges” that could not be addressed by domestic training policies alone. Hunt defended his handling of the economy and public finances on Wednesday, saying he had brought stability to the economic outlook and protected public investment spending. He said independent forecasters believed the government was on track to meet Rishi Sunak’s targets of halving inflation and growing the economy, but there was “nothing automatic” about controlling rising prices: There’s a plan, we are going to stick to it. The Bank of England has a role through monetary policy and interest rates, we support them 150% with that. But we have our role in government, what I do on the fiscal side in terms of tax and spend has an influence and if markets judge that we are not getting our borrowing under control they will punish us with higher interest rates. 12.41pm BST That’s all from Bailey. The next big speech will come from Labour party leader Keir Starmer at 3:20pm BST. You can view the full BCC conference agenda here. 12.40pm BST Final question for BoE governor Andrew Bailey is around central bank independence, which has been thrown into question over the past 12 months. Bailey says he won’t comment on the politics surrounding the issue. However, he suggests that the BoE was able to take such swift action around the LDI pensions crisis last September, and around the emergency sale of Silicon Valley Bank UK in March, precisely because it was independent. We take these actions…rapidly and we have the tools to do it, which is part of our independence. 12.33pm BST One audience member has asked whether there’s “any point” in having a target that the Bank of England “rarely meet,” and whether the BoE should have a “more complex mandate.” Bailey replies that it’s important that the central bank have a “simple and transparent target” and counters the claim that the BoE have failed its current mandate. Inflation was hovering at around 2% for most of the decade prior to Covid, he explains. 12.22pm BST One business executive has challenged Bailey on the level of interest rates, saying it has heaped further cost pressures on firms across the UK. But Bailey says there are no quick fixes. I do understand the very difficult consequences of the the economic conditions and the inflation that that we’re facing. What would be a worse outcome is if we did not get the inflation under control. And I come back to this question about persistence and about second round effects. I’m afraid there’s nothing that is no tool that we have to make the initial shocks go away. He says what the BoE can do is make sure that the effects of inflation are just temporary. “That’s why we’re raising interest rates,” he explains. 12.12pm BST Turning to media questions, Bailey is asked by Bloomberg whether the Bank of England has lost credibility by ‘missing’ the inflation shock, having to raise rates more aggressively than expected, and reversing some earlier forecasts last month. Bailey notes that BoE forecasts are “always conditional” and have to be adapted, and react to global “shocks” that filter through to the UK economy. He again pushes back against claims that somehow monetary policy caused, or aggravated inflation, and says the test of BoE credibility will be its ability to bring inflation back to its 2% target going forward. The test for me is that, we can have these things going on in the world around u,s which are terrible and have very bad effects, and the regime can bring inflation back to target. That’s the test of credibility for me. 12.02pm BST BoE&apos;s Bailey: Labour market is &apos;loosening&apos;, pay growth to ease later this. year Meanwhile, Bailey says there are some indications that there is some ‘loosening’ in the labour market, though the number of job openings is still high compared to pre-pandemic levels. Andrew Bailey says some evidence that shock to the size of labour force - reducing it post pandemic through early retirement and long term sickness - may be beginning to reverse. — Simon Jack (@BBCSimonJack) May 17, 2023 Bailey explains: There are signs that the labour market is loosening a little. There has been some recovery in labour market participation, especially amongst younger workers, and the number of vacancies has come down from very high levels. The ratio of the number of vacancies to the number of unemployed, a key measure of labour market tightness, has fallen as a result. He said business are reporting fewer recruitment difficulties, and that there are fewer job moves. Employers are also receiving more job applications for their openings. But the easing of labour market tightness is happening at a slower pace than we expected in February, and the labour market remains very tight. The number of vacancies remains significantly higher, relative to the number of unemployed, than before the pandemic, and employment figures have been strong. On pay, meanwhile, he says nominal pay growth has “fallen back slightly” and could ease further later this year. 11.46am BST BoE&apos;s Bailey: People in the UK &quot;can rely on their banks&quot; Despite the failure of three US banks and Switzerland’s Credit Suisse, Bailey has said UK consumers – and businesses – shouldn’t fear. I should note that overseas bank failures have resulted in asset price volatility recently, and spreads on UK banks’ wholesale funding rose for a while. But this was short-lived, implying little impact on the interest rates facing households and companies. The UK banking sector remains resilient, with robust capital and strong liquidity positions, and it continues to have the capacity to support the economy. People in the United Kingdom can rely on their banks. He adds that the interest rate-setting monetary policy committee has not had to shift course as a result of the banking turmoil, “nor should it.” Updated at 11.48am BST 11.36am BST Perhaps in an effort to try ensure the Bank of England seems more in touch following its chief economist’s faux pas last month, Bailey has said he understands the pressures facing those worse off during the cost of living crisis. Bailey says he visited a food bank in Exeter yesterday, where it was “clear that many people face difficult choices and have had to cut back. even on essentials.” It comes weeks after BoE chief economist Huw Pill faced criticism for saying that British households and businesses “need to accept” they are poorer and stop seeking pay increases and pushing prices higher. 11.32am BST And while rising interest rates make it harder for households too, he says it’s a necessary tool that the BoE have to use. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said monetary policy “can’t make the impact on real incomes go away.” Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images Bailey says: We know that higher interest rates make things hard for many people too. But we’re conscious that high inflation always hits the least well-off the hardest. Our job is to make sure inflation is low and stable, so we have had to raise rates to bring inflation back down. He adds: Monetary policy can’t make the impact on real incomes go away I’m afraid. What we have to do is to take action to ensure that inflation falls as the external shocks abate – that inflationary impulses from these external sources do not cause persistent ‘second-round’ effects on domestic wage and price setting that could hold inflation up for longer. That is why we have increased Bank Rate by nearly 41⁄2 percentage points from December 2021, from 0.1% then to 4.5% now. 11.27am BST BoE&apos;s Bailey: Inflation was not exacerbated by &apos;too loose&apos; monetary policy Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is focusing on inflation, and says that while the BoE can help with price pressures, some factors have been completely out of its control. He pushed back against arguments that the BoE could have done more to prepare itself for the shocks that eventually hit the UK economy (IE pandemic supply chain pressures, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), namely by tightening monetary policy earlier. I’d like to push back strongly against one argument you sometimes hear, which is that inflation is high because monetary policy was too loose in the past. The headline is that, even if we had had the benefit of full hindsight in the run-up to the war in Ukraine, and ample advanced warning – which for the record we did not, no one did – then in order to keep inflation at around 2%, we would have had to raise the bank rate well into double digits, sending unemployment much higher than it is today, and we would have had to do so in the middle of the worst pandemic in more than a century. 11.12am BST Next up at the BCC annual conference: Bank of England Andrew Bailey. 11.09am BST Katie Prescott from the Times pushes the chancellor on comments from businesses who say they frustrated by “onerous regulation” and other roadblocks to operating in the UK. She cites e-money firm Revolut that is still waiting to secure a UK banking license (though we understand, through previous reporting, that there may be other factors at play in the delay). His message? Contact government ministers. So the first thing I would say is if you have any concerns, come and talk to me. Come and talk to Kemi Badenoch and talk to Michelle Donelan because we want to do everything we can to support those businesses. In Revolut’s case in particular, I have had a number of discussions and we are introducing a growth duty for our financial sector regulators in the financial services and markets bill that is coming up. And they have been very responsive recently in understanding the need to foster the UK competitiveness and fintech is one of our great success stories. 11.01am BST Turning to audience questions, Simon Jack from the BBC asks about the other story we’ve been following this morning regarding Vauxhall-carmaker Stellantis railing against post-Brexit rules. They are concerned that the post-Brexit deal will end up taxing manufacturers that have to source parts from outside the UK, despite claims that they have no other option. Jeremy Hunt agrees that in the UK “we need to have battery making capacity in the UK” and hints more supply may be coming down the line: We have the ability under the post Brexit trading arrangements to import EV batteries from other EU countries. But the reality is there is a supply shortage, everyone is trying to develop supply of EV batteries, and so we need to have that supply here in the UK. The closer it’s located to the factories that are making the rest of the car, the better. And all I would say is, watch this space, because we are very focused on making sure the UK gets that EV manufacturing capacity. 10.49am BST On Brexit, Jeremy Hunt is pressed by the moderator about the challenge that Brexit has posed for many businesses in the room for the BCC conference this morning. He’s sidestepped the question a bit, saying that “any change in your trading relations with your biggest trading partner presents challenges” but notes that the surge in energy prices linked to the war in Ukraine have also hampered businesses. He then goes on to talk about Britain’s successes and opportunities in life sciences, tech and education. “But it’s up to us, as every business person here knows, it’s up to us to make the most of that opportunity.” 10.42am BST Those working from home, take warning: Hunt says remote working should be the exception, not the rule. Hunt is hoping workers get back into the office, with working from home becoming the exception and not the rule. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters While he’s supportive of the policy for those with disabilities and mobility issues, he says business innovation may be hampered by having people working at their kitchen tables, without the opportunity for spontaneous collaboration. There is nothing like sitting around a table, seeing people face-to-face, developing team spirit, and I worry about the loss of creativity when people are permanently working from home and not having those water cooler moments where they bounce ideas off each other. And not every great business idea happens in a structured formal meeting. And so I think that’s why increasingly businesses are saying they want people back, unless there’s a reason I think we will get to a point where the default is with exception of specific categories of work, like for example, call centre work, but I think the default will be you work in the office and so there’s a good reason not to be in the office and gradually we’re getting there. 10.22am BST Hunt: Government will ease immigration for struggling sectors, but only short-term Hunt is then pressed on Conservative party pressure to lower immigration, all while the UK is facing a skills gap. Aside from trying to get parents, early retirees, and those struggling with disabilities into the workforce, he says the government will open borders for key sectors struggling with labour shortages – but only in the short-term. We will, at the margins, always be pragmatic. So for example, we put care homes on the shortage occupation list, some construction industry sectors, and we will keep talking to all of you about where there are short-term challenges. What we need to do is to tap into the incredible potential that we have at home at the same time, and as we make that journey to be sensible and pragmatic about the immigration requirements where there are particular pressures. Updated at 11.32am BST 10.16am BST Hunt says the government is also supporting businesses though competitive tax policies and investment incentives. We have got an incredible opportunity in this country to be the most dynamic and innovative economy in Europe. And part of that is to have competitive business taxes. However, he says the government recognises that there are other concerns plaguing UK business, including recruitment. Hunt explains the government addressed in his latest budget through extra childcare for working parents, as well as support for people with disabilities who are able to work from home because of new company policies. He also says the government has supported business by allowing for “full expensing” of business investments – a policy which is running for three years, but which he hopes will be made permanent. We have lagged France, Germany and the United States in terms of our business investment for many years, and that feeds through into our productivity. And we need to increase that and this is one of the ways that we can support additional investment by businesses. 9.55am BST Jeremy Hunt addresses business leaders at British Chambers of Commerce conference UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt is addressing business leaders at the British Chambers of Commerce conference at in London this morning. Jeremy Hunt has told businesses he understand concerns about tax levels. Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock His first message is that cutting inflation – currently at 10.1% - is a priority. He says there is “nothing automatic” about bringing down inflation and that the Bank of England has strong support from the government in their efforts to bring it back to its target of 2%. Hunt adds that what he does on the fiscal side, in terms of tax and spending has an influence, but if markets judge that the government is not getting borrowing under control, they will again “punish us with higher interest rates.” For those worried about levels of taxes, “I agree,” Hunt says. “We have to get business taxes down.” But he stresses that the “worst tax of all is inflation.” “It’s a tax for which you get nothing back in return,” eating away at consumer spending and confidence, and deterring businesses from investing. Cutting inflation he says: “has to be the overwhelming priority for this year”. Updated at 10.01am BST 9.20am BST Stellantis originally raised its concerns about the weak domestic supply chain for electric vehicle manufacturing in a submission to the the business and trade committee. You can view that document in full here. Let’s paraphrase their main points: There aren’t sufficient battery production supply chains in the UK or Europe. This this is unlikely to change by 2025 or 2030, despite the fact that this is key to meeting the origin rules that require 45% of the value of an electric vehicle to be sourced locally under the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Importing parts to the UK will lead to higher costs and potential tariffs under post-Brexit rules. If carmakers source batteries from mainland Europe and China, as currently planned, they will face higher logistics costs since they’ll have to transport the batteries from mainland Europe to the UK, plus additional potential tariff costs if they fail to meet origin rules. The potential consequences? Stellantis says costs will be passed on to the consumer, and unsustainable operations will eventually close, resulting in job losses. Stellantis says in the document: If the cost of EV manufacturing in the UK becomes uncompetitive and unsustainable operations will close. Manufacturers will not continue to invest and relocate manufacturing operations outside of UK, as seen with previously established UK manufacturers such as Ford and Mini. The closing of UK manufacturing will see significant job losses, the loss of a skilled workforce and a negative impact to the UK economy. 8.35am BST Brexit tariff rules pose &apos;existential threat&apos; to UK car industry, academic warns An economics academic has warned there is an “existential threat to the UK car industry”. David Bailey, professor of business economics at the Birmingham Business School, told the BBC Today programme that the stricter rules and increased tariffs set to come into force next year would put British manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage: I think there is a kind of existential threat to the UK car industry. The rules in the Brexit agreement don’t help the UK car industry either. If they can’t meet those rules, they’ll face a 10% tariff on cars made in the UK and exported to the EU and vice versa. That will put the UK at a competitive disadvantage. He added: Car makers have been saying for some time, they can’t meet those rules as they tighten up, and they’re going to potentially be facing tariffs. Updated at 8.48am BST 8.24am BST A bit of background about Stellantis, which is the fourth-largest automaker in the world. Its brands include Vauxhall, Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat, DS, Jeep, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Abarth and Fiat Professional brands in the UK, and it employs more than 5,000 people in the UK, including at two manufacturing sites: Ellesmere Port and Luton IBC. Stellantis’ Ellesmere Port site is currently being redeveloped to build its fleet of small electric vans, including the Vauxhall Combo, Citroën Berlingo, Peugeot Partner, and Opel Combo. The company says it’s moving towards becoming 100% electric, which is why the sourcing of its electric car parts that are affected by the Brexit trade deal, are said to be so important. 8.15am BST Labour party leader Keir Starmer has weighed in, telling BBC Breakfast that the issues being raised by Stellantis are yet another sign that the Brexit trade deal needs to be improved. Stellantis has said it is unlikely to be able to keep its promise to make electric vehicles in the UK without changes to the trade agreement with the EU. The Labour leader said there were may “barriers” that needed to be reviewed in any update the the Brexit deal, and said that a future Labour government would aim to “make things here in Britain” to ensure a strong domestic supply chain. &apos;We need a better Brexit deal&apos; Labour leader Keir Starmer spoke to #BBCBreakfast after Stellantis, which makes Vauxhall, Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat, called on the government to renegotiate part of the Brexit deal or risk losing parts of its car industryhttps://t.co/nmGD8WTbpQ pic.twitter.com/NNz7zKB5R6 — BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) May 17, 2023 Starmer said: Look, we’re not going to re-enter the EU. We do need to improve that deal. Of course we want a closer trading relationship, we absolutely do. We want to ensure that Vauxhall and many others not just survive in this country but thrive. Because there are jobs bound up, there are families watching this morning either employed by Vauxhall or a similar place who are deeply worried about what this means. So yes we need a better Brexit deal. We will make Brexit work. That doesn’t mean reversing the decision and going back into the EU but the deal we’ve got, it was said to be oven-ready, it wasn’t even half-baked. So of course we’ve got to repair that along with all the other things we’ll have to repair if and when we are privileged to come into government.” 8.05am BST Vauxhall-maker to meet UK minister amid Brexit rule concerns Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. We kick off the day with news that UK business secretary Kemi Badenoch is set to meet with bosses from Stellantis – the maker of Vauxhall, Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat – amid concerns that the car industry will struggle to meet new Brexit rules over where parts are sourced, due to in part to a weak domestic supply chain and surging inflation. The carmaker has the rules could force it to shut some of its UK operations, putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Those rules, which come into force next year, state that, unless manufacturers source 45% of the value of electric car parts from the UK or EU, their vehicles will be subject to a 10% tariff. Cars at the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA But Stellantis says carmakers are struggling to source those parts within the UK and EU. That is due in part to a lack of UK battery plants and a strong domestic supply chain, while there have been speedier developments elsewhere. They are also being hit by a surge in the costs of raw materials. Stellantis bosses have said that the prospect of not meeting those origin rules, and being hit with 10% tariffs, will make the industry uncompetitive. So what to do? The company is set to discuss the matter with Badenoch later today to explore some solutions, which could include reviewing arrangements for manufacturing parts in Serbia and Morocco. There may be a push to influence ministers ahead of plans to renegotiate the trade deal in 2025, which was part of the original pact between the UK and the EU signed by Lord Frost in December 2020. Elsewhere…we’ll be keeping an eye on the British Chambers of Commerce Annual Conference, where we’re expected to hear from chancellor Jeremy Hunt, Bank of England Andrew Bailey and Labour leader Keir Starmer. Stay tuned!

    <head>Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv denies Moscow’s claim that hypersonic missile destroyed a US-made Patriot defence system – live</head>
    <body>12.37pm BST The bank accounts of Finland’s embassy and consulate in Russia are frozen and the Nordic country has not had an explanation from its neighbour, the Finnish foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Finland, which has a long border with Russia, formally joined Nato on 4 April in a historic policy shift brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that drew a threat from Moscow of countermeasures. The Finnish foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told reporters the bank accounts had stopped working on 27 April, Reuters reported. “The accounts of Finnish embassies have been frozen in Russia and at the moment they cannot be used,” Haavisto said, adding the missions had been using their cash reserves to pay bills. Haavisto said Finland had sent Russian authorities a notice on 4 May requesting that Russia ensure the missions’ ability to function in Russia and asking for an official explanation for the freeze, but it had not received one so far. Updated at 12.43pm BST 12.01pm BST The number of Kazakhs who believe neighbouring Russia may invade the former Soviet republic has doubled over the past six months as the war in Ukraine continues, an opinion poll by Kazakh researchers showed on Wednesday. The central Asian nation of 20 million has close historical, economic and security ties with Moscow, but has maintained neutrality in the Ukrainian conflict, refusing to recognise Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine’s territory, Reuters reported. According to the poll of 1,100 respondents, carried out by non-government organisations MediaNet and PaperLab between 3-12 May and , almost 60% are also neutral with regards to the war, 12.8% support Russia and 21.1% support Ukraine, figures similar to those produced by a similar poll last December. However, the number of people who think Russia may also invade Kazakhstan has risen to 15% from 8.3% in the previous poll. Nearly a third of respondents said their perception of Russia had worsened because of the war, over a half said it had not changed and only 4.7% said it had improved. Updated at 12.17pm BST 11.31am BST The German government is looking into mechanisms to secure war damages for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the possibility of using Russian assets to compensate the country, a government spokesperson said. Chancellor Olaf Scholz was among European leaders who agreed to set up a register of damages for the Ukraine war during a meeting in Reykjavik this week, Reuters reported. Scholz also said his government wanted pragmatic measures to prevent the circumvention of sanctions imposed on Russia, appearing to temper US calls for a more wide-ranging ban on exports. US officials expect G7 members to agree to adjust their approach to sanctions so that, at least for certain categories of goods, all exports are automatically banned unless they are on a list of approved items. “We’re trying to promote good, pragmatic further development,” Scholz said when asked about the issue on the sidelines of the Council of Europe meeting in Iceland. He hoped an agreement will be reached “without there being any major system changes”. Updated at 11.32am BST 11.00am BST Summary of the day so far … Ukraine denied on Wednesday that a Russian hypersonic missile had destroyed a US-made Patriot missile defence system during an airstrike on Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry made the assertion on Tuesday after an overnight air attack on the Ukrainian capital. Two US officials later said a Patriot system had probably suffered damage but that it did not appear to have been destroyed. “I want to say: do not worry about the fate of the Patriot,” Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told Ukrainian television. He ruled out the possibility of a Russian “Kinzhal” missile knocking out a Patriot system. Ukraine had said it had neutralised the Kremlin’s most potent hypersonic weapon, shooting down six out of six Kinzhal missiles launched at Kyiv during a sweeping and “exceptionally intense” night-time attack. It was the first time Ukraine has claimed to have struck an entire volley of Kinzhals, and if confirmed would demonstrate the effectiveness of Kyiv’s newly deployed western-supplied air defences. The attack on Kyiv was one of the biggest since the 2022 invasion and followed Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s three-day trip to Europe. During meetings in London, Berlin, Paris and Rome, Ukraine’s president secured promises of more military assistance, including long-range attack drones from the UK. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the Security Service of Ukraine announced that it had identified six residents of Kyiv who filmed the work of the Ukrainian air defence forces and posted photos and videos on social networks. The SBU said it had also blocked webcams that automatically broadcast in real time from Kyiv, which had captured images of the air defence in action. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-imposed leader of Ukraine’s partially occupied Donetsk region, has posted to Telegram to say there have been civilian casualties in the area this morning after Ukrainian shelling. Suspilne reports that overnight Russian troops launched a rocket attack on Mykolaiv and one person was injured. A shopping centre, a car showroom and an industrial facility were partially destroyed; residential buildings and shops were damaged. It said that Wednesday morning the Russian Federation shelled a hospital in Beryslav, Kherson region. There is damage, but no one was hurt. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said the war in Ukraine may end due to the US abandoning its allies, as he said it had done before in Afghanistan. Bank accounts of Finland’s embassies in Russia have been frozen, the Finnish foreign ministry said on Wednesday. China has notified several foreign missions in Beijing not to display “politicised propaganda” on their buildings, diplomats told Reuters, adding the request appeared aimed at Ukrainian flags they have displayed since Russia’s invasion. The Kremlin said it would not enter into “hypothetical discussions” on what Russia will do if the Black Sea grain deal lapses on Thursday. Updated at 12.19pm BST 10.54am BST The Kremlin said it would not enter into “hypothetical discussions” on what Russia will do if the Black Sea grain deal lapses on Thursday. Moscow has said it will quit the deal, under which Russia allows Ukraine to export grain safely from Black Sea ports despite the war raging on land, on Thursday unless a list of demands for its own agricultural trade are met. “I don’t think any hypothetical discussions are appropriate here,” Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing. “As of now, the decision hasn’t been announced, as you know. You’ll just have to wait until it is announced.” 10.24am BST Ukraine’s defence ministry has pubished a short video clip which it claims shows “the unbroken spirit of Bakhmut”. In the video a member of service personnel can be seen playing a piano in a heavily damaged building, which the sound of explosions can be heard in the background. The unbroken spirit of Bakhmut. 🎥 @DPSU_ua pic.twitter.com/pJR8W3vEgA — Defense of Ukraine (@DefenceU) May 17, 2023 The Guardian has not independently verified the location or time of the video. 10.11am BST Pushilin claims there are civilian casualties in occupied Donetsk after Ukrainian strikes Denis Pushilin, the Russian-imposed leader of Ukraine’s partially occupied Donetsk region, has posted to Telegram to say there have been civilian casualties in the area this morning. He wrote: Since the morning the enemy has been fiercely shelling the cities of the republic [occupied Donetsk]. Unfortunately, there are already casualties among the civilian population – in the Petrovskyi district of Donetsk, one person was killed at a public transport stop and four more civilians were injured. In Yasynuvata, the enemy used rocket artillery on the city blocks. At the moment, five victims among the civilian population are known. The wounded were taken to medical facilities, they are provided with all the necessary assistance. As a result of the shelling, five residential buildings and several infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk is one of the region of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. 10.06am BST Marija Pejčinović Burić, secretary general of the Council of Europe, which is meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, has posted an image of Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmyhal attending the event, alongside the message: There cannot be a just and sustainable peace without accountability.

Russia’s defence ministry made the assertion on Tuesday after an overnight air attack on the Ukrainian capital. Two US officials later said a Patriot system had probably suffered damage but that it did not appear to have been destroyed. “I want to say: do not worry about the fate of the Patriot,” Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told Ukrainian television. He ruled out the possibility of a Russian “Kinzhal” missile knocking out a Patriot system. “Destroying the system with some kind of ‘Kinzhal’, it’s impossible. Everything that they say there, it can remain in their propaganda archive,” Reuters reports he said. 9.05am BST Bank accounts of Finland’s embassies in Russia have been frozen, the Finnish foreign ministry said on Wednesday. A ministry spokesperson told Reuters the bank accounts of both Finland’s Moscow embassy and its St Petersburg consulate were not functioning. 8.46am BST Suspilne, Ukraine&apos;s state broadcaster, reports that the Security Service of Ukraine announced that they had identified six residents of Kyiv who filmed the work of the Ukrainian air defence forces and posted photos and videos on social networks. The SBU said it had also blocked webcams that automatically broadcast in real time from Kyiv, which had captured images of the air defence in action. 8.44am BST Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said the war in Ukraine may end due to the US abandoning its allies, as he said it had done before in Afghanistan. Tass reports that in an interview with the Tsargrad TV channel, the head of Russian diplomacy recalled the US “abandoned the Afghan leadership on which they had relied during the 20-year US occupation of that country.” “I hope that modern politicians pay attention to history,” Tass reports Lavrov said. “Political scientists write a lot about this. They predict that all this will continue as long as the Americans need it. These people [the Kyiv government] will be in power as long as they [the US] need them,” the Russian foreign minister said. Updated at 12.20pm BST 8.14am BST Suspilne, Ukraine&apos;s state broadcaster, offers this roundup of overnight developments from Ukraine: At night, Russian troops launched a rocket attack on Mykolaiv: one person was injured. A shopping centre, a car showroom and an industrial facility were partially destroyed; residential buildings and shops were damaged. In the morning, the Russian Federation shelled a hospital in Beryslav, Kherson region. There is damage, no one was hurt. Yesterday, the Russian army fired more than 400 projectiles in the Kherson region – seven people were injured. On 16 May, as a result of Russian shelling in Donetsk region, one person died and seven were injured. Three people were injured in the Zaporizhzhia region yesterday. The claims have not been independently verified. 7.39am BST There has been a lot of talk this week about Russia’s “hypersonic” missile, the Kinzhal, and whether the US-supplied Patriot system has the capability of shooting them down. Reuters has this little explainer today, writing: The Patriot system was designed before hypersonic weapons were sent to battlefield and manufacturer Raytheon has not said publicly that the is effective against a missile flying at hypersonic speeds (anything above five times the speed of sound). While the US said that the Patriot system brought down last week’s Khinzal missile, it was not clear if that missile was traveling at hypersonic speed at the time. While Russia’s Kinzhal missile may reach speeds of up to 7,600 mph (12,350 kph), “Russia’s designation of the Kinzhal as a ‘hypersonic’ missile is somewhat misleading, as nearly all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic speeds (i.e. above Mach 5) at some point during their flight,” the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a March 2022 report. 7.06am BST China has notified several foreign missions in Beijing not to display “politicised propaganda” on their buildings, diplomats told Reuters, adding the request appeared aimed at Ukrainian flags they have displayed since Russia’s invasion. Several foreign missions in China raised the Ukrainian flag, or displayed its image in posters and lights, following the February 2022 invasion that sparked international condemnation of Russia, a close ally of China. “We and others got a letter calling on embassies and representative offices to refrain from using the outer walls of their buildings for ‘politicised propaganda’,” one diplomat, whose embassy is displaying a Ukraine flag image, told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The diplomat said the mission did not intend to comply with the notification. Three other Beijing-based diplomats confirmed that there had been a notification, adding that while it did not directly mention the Ukraine flag it was clearly aimed at that. 6.47am BST A US-made Patriot missile defence system being used by Ukraine probably suffered some damage from a Russian strike, two US officials told Reuters on Tuesday, adding that it did not appear to have been destroyed. The Patriot system is one of an array of sophisticated air defence units supplied by the West to help Ukraine repel a Russian campaign of air strikes that has targeted critical infrastructure, power facilities and other sites. American Patriot surface-to-air missile system presented at the Warsaw-Radom airport in Radom, 20 April 2023. Photograph: Paweł Supernak/EPA One US official, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity and citing initial information, said Washington and Kyiv were already talking about the best way to repair the system and at this point it did not appear the system would have to be removed from Ukraine. The official added that the United States would have a better understanding in the coming days and information could change over time. The Guardian could not independently verify the truth of the comments. The Patriot is considered to be one of the most advanced US air defence systems, including against aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. It typically includes launchers along with radar and other support vehicles. Updated at 8.09am BST 6.36am BST And these are the demands Russia has made, per Reuters: In a letter to UN officials on 16 March, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said Moscow would only consider extending the Ukraine Black Sea grain export deal beyond 18 May if the following “systemic problems” were resolved: Returning the Russian Agricultural Bank (Rosselkhozbank) to the Swift payment system. A resumption of supplies to Russia of agricultural machinery and spare parts. Lifting restrictions on insurance and access to ports for Russian ships and cargo. The resumption of an ammonia pipeline from Russia’s Togliatti to Odesa in Ukraine. Unblocking accounts and financial activities of Russian fertiliser companies. Updated at 8.10am BST 6.29am BST Reuters has this useful explainer on what falls under the Black Sea grain deal, which is under threat after Russia said it will withdraw from the deal if its demands aren’t met. Under the deal: Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations set up a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul, staffed by officials from each party. Ukraine can safely export grain and related foodstuffs and fertilizers, including ammonia, from the ports of Odesa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny. All activities in Ukrainian territorial waters are under the authority and responsibility of Ukraine. The parties agreed not to undertake any attacks against merchant vessels and other civilian vessels and port facilities covered by the deal. To prevent provocations and incidents, movement of vessels transiting the maritime humanitarian corridor is monitored remotely. No military ships, aircraft or drones can approach within 10 nautical miles of the corridor without JCC authorisation. All merchant vessels are subject to inspection inbound and outbound from Ukraine by a JCC team in Turkish harbours. The agreement was agreed to remain in effect for 120 days and be extended automatically for the same period, unless one of the parties notifies the other of the intent to terminate the initiative, or to modify it. The deal was extended in November for 120 days and then in March for at least 60 days. 6.18am BST Zelenskiy welcomes ‘good start’ to F-16 fighter jets coalition announced by UK and Netherlands Zelenskiy has welcomed a pledge by the UK and the Netherlands to build an “international coalition” to provide fighter jet support for Ukraine, and France’s support for the coalition, as a “good start”. Reacting to the pledge in his nightly address, Zelensky called it “a good start to the coalition”, adding: “Thank you all.” UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Tuesday pledged to build an “international coalition” to provide fighter jet support for Ukraine. Western nations have balked so far at providing advanced jets to help Ukraine take command of the skies against Russia, AFP reports. Sunak said on Monday however the UK was preparing to open a flight school to train its pilots. French President Emmanuel Macron at the same time offered to train Ukrainian fighter pilots but ruled out sending war planes to Kyiv.

The ship’s passage begins a day before Russia could quit the pact over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports, Reuters reports. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the Black Sea deal for an initial 120 days in July last year to help tackle a global food crisis that has been aggravated by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, one of the world’s leading grain exporters. Moscow agreed to extend the Black Sea pact for a further 120 days in November, but then in March it agreed to a 60 day extension – until May 18 – unless a list of demands regarding its own agricultural exports was met. To convince Russia in July to allow Black Sea grain exports, the United Nations agreed at the same time to help Moscow with its own agricultural shipments for three years. “There are still a lot of open questions regarding our part of the deal. Now a decision will have to be taken,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday, according to Russian media. 5.56am BST Opening summary Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning: the last ship is due to leave a port in Ukraine today under the deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of grain a day before Russia could quit the pact over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports. And Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has responded to the announcement from the UK and the Netherlands that they would build an “international coalition” to help procure F-16 fighter jets for the country, a move that France supported, calling it a “good start”. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime here are the key recent developments: Ukraine said it had neutralised the Kremlin’s most potent hypersonic weapon, shooting down six out of six Kinzhal missiles launched at Kyiv during a sweeping and “exceptionally intense” night-time attack. It is the first time Ukraine has claimed to have struck an entire volley of Kinzhals, and if confirmed would demonstrate the effectiveness of Kyiv’s newly deployed western-supplied air defences. The attack on Kyiv was one of the biggest since the 2022 invasion and followed Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s three-day trip to Europe. During meetings in London, Berlin, Paris and Rome, Ukraine’s president secured promises of more military assistance, including long-range attack drones from the UK. European leaders convening in Iceland for two days pledged to hold Russia to account and unveiled a mechanism to track the losses and damage inflicted by Moscow’s forces. The British and Dutch prime ministers, Rishi Sunak and Mark Rutte, have agreed to build an “international coalition” to help procure F-16 fighter jets for Ukraine, the British government has announced. The assembly in a pro-Russian region of Moldova has endorsed the election of a local leader intent on improving ties with Moscow, setting up a clash with the pro-European national government. Ukrainian forces have taken back about 20 sq km (7.5 sq miles) of territory from Russian forces around the eastern city of Bakhmut in recent days, the Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. She said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had advanced “somewhat” in the city of Bakhmut itself, and that heavy fighting continued. The head of Ukraine’s supreme court, Vsevolod Kniaziev, has been arrested as part of the biggest bribery investigation in Ukraine’s history. Police detained Knaiziev as part of a $2.7m bribery inquiry, as Kyiv pursues anti-graft measures required for closer integration with the EU. Six African leaders plan to travel to Russia and Ukraine “as soon as is possible” to help find a resolution to the war, the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had “agreed to receive the mission and the African heads of state, in both Moscow and Kyiv”, Ramaphosa said. A bill banning Russian uranium imports to the US gained momentum on Tuesday by passing a committee in the US House of Representatives. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the US banned imports of its oil and imposed a price cap with other western countries on sea-borne exports of its crude and oil products, but not uranium. About 2,000 people who had helped defend the Azovstal plant who were captured and became prisoners of war are still in the hands of the Russians, according to a charity set up to support families and those connected to the factory. Six people have been killed in Kharkiv and Donetsk over the last 24 hours, according to the regions’ governors. Oleh Syniehubov and Pavlo Kyrylenko confirmed the figures on Tuesday. Russia said it was still undecided on the extension of a Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine, brokered by the UN and Turkey and due to expire on 18 May. “There are a lot of unanswered questions regarding our part of the deal … now we have to make a decision,” the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</body>

    <head>Abortion pill case: where does the lawsuit against the pill currently stand?</head>
    <body>On Wednesday, the fifth circuit court of appeals will consider the future of mifepristone, a crucial drug used in over half of US abortions, after a district court judge ruled the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was wrong to approve it more than two decades ago. Access to the drug remains unchanged in states where abortion is still legal while the case proceeds. The hearings follow a lengthy succession of court judgments. In late April, the supreme court blocked court-ordered restrictions on mifepristone while a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion groups targeting the pill continues. Related: US supreme court blocks ruling limiting access to abortion pill The lawsuit is the most significant abortion rights case to make its way through the courts since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. Fourteen states have banned abortion in the last 11 months, but new restrictions on the pill would apply even in states where the procedure is still allowed. What happened? In November a lawsuit was filed by the Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), arguing that the FDA exceeded its regulatory authority and ignored safety concerns when it approved mifepristone – a drug that blocks progesterone, a hormone needed for a pregnancy to develop – more than two decades ago. The FDA vigorously rejected those arguments, pointing to repeated and rigorous reviews of the highly regulated drug. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas, Matthew Kacsmaryk, sided with the plaintiffs, issuing a preliminary injunction on 7 April suspending the FDA’s 23-year-old approval of mifepristone. He also endorsed the plaintiffs’ views that a previously dormant, 150-year-old anti-vice law called the Comstock Act “plainly forecloses mail-order abortion”. Related: An anti-obscenity law from 1873 was discarded for decades. Now the anti-choice movement wants it back | Moira Donegan The ADF is thought to have chosen to file the lawsuit in Amarillo, Texas, specifically so it would appear before Kacsmaryk, who is known for his anti-abortion views, and employed anti-abortion rhetoric throughout his decision, referring to mifepristone as a drug used to “kill the unborn human”. The Biden administration took the decision to the fifth circuit court of appeals, where two judges – also appointed by Donald Trump – blocked the part of the ruling overturning the FDA’s initial 2000 approval of mifepristone, but reimposed restrictions on the drug previously lifted by the FDA. They include limiting mifepristone use after seven weeks of pregnancy – it is currently approved through 10 weeks – and banning delivery by mail. The FDA had decided in 2021 to remove the drug’s in-person dispensing requirement during the pandemic, which broadened access by allowing the drug to be prescribed via telehealth and sent in the mail. The Biden administration appealed the ruling to the supreme court, which temporarily blocked the lower courts’ decisions, returning the case to the fifth circuit. The high court also ruled that access to the pill will remain unchanged for the duration of the suit, which will very likely make its way back to the supreme court. What is the status of the abortion pill? For the moment, mifepristone has not been banned and access remains unaffected as the case proceeds. Misoprostol, the second drug commonly administered alongside mifepristone to induce a medical abortion, is not at issue in this lawsuit. Even a supreme court ruling should have little impact in states where abortion is already banned: neither misoprostol nor mifepristone has been legally available for abortions in these states since bans came into place after the fall of Roe. Related: ‘It’s a war’: the doctor who wants Americans to get abortion pills before it’s too late While misoprostol – which helps to empty the uterus by causing the cervix to soften and dilate, and the uterus to contract – can be used safely on its own, it is less effective. Misoprostol-only abortions result in successful termination 88% of the time, and with more complicated side-effects and more need for follow-up care, recent research has shown. Some of the main abortion providers – including Planned Parenthood, Carafem and Abortion Delivered – have confirmed that they are prepared to prescribe a misoprostol-only regimen for abortions in the event of mifepristone being pulled off the market. Aid Access, the international group that ships abortion pills to the US, trialled misoprostol-only regimens for abortions during the pandemic, with success. What does the Comstock Act have to do with it? Court watchers are looking out for what the judges will say, if anything, about the Comstock Act – an 1873 anti-vice law banning certain products such as contraceptives, pornography and abortifacients from being sent through the mail. That law has effectively long been dead in the water, but the plaintiffs have tried to revive it, suggesting that the FDA ran afoul of the Comstock Act when it made pills obtainable by mail in 2021. Other anti-abortion activists have made similar efforts to bring back the law, viewing it as a possible avenue for banning abortion nationwide. The Department of Justice issued an opinion on Comstock in December 2022, clarifying its own opinion that the law does not apply when the sender of pills intends for them to be used lawfully. When the appeals court first considered the mifepristone case in April, the panel of judges seemed to favor the plaintiffs’ arguments on Comstock, writing that the “plain text” of of the law prohibits the mailing of abortion drugs, regardless of whether they are intended for abortions. If Comstock is ultimately affirmed as good law, it would have sweeping impacts on abortion in the US, as it could also be read to ban the mailing of any instrument used to perform abortions. What could this case mean for abortion access? If mifepristone becomes less available, and since medication abortion accounts for more than half of US abortions, providers fear a surge of demand on clinics providing surgical procedures. Many are already under strain from an increase in patients traveling from states where abortion is banned or heavily restricted. Online pharmacies and other telehealth providers have proliferated since Roe v Wade was overturned, enabled by the FDA’s 2021 decision to allow abortion pills to be sent in the mail. If the courts ultimately rule that mifepristone cannot be mailed, this could shutter those businesses. Do the implications of the case go beyond abortion? The Biden administration, along with a coalition of pharmaceutical companies, warned of ensuing regulatory chaos around drug approvals should the judiciary be permitted to order regulations on mifepristone opposed by the FDA. “If this ruling were to stand, then there will be virtually no prescription, approved by the FDA, that would be safe from these kinds of political, ideological attacks,” Biden said in a written statement after Kacsmaryk’s decision in early April.</body>

    <head>Angela Rayner attacks Oliver Dowden over Tory record on NHS waiting lists and child poverty as deputies stand in at PMQs – live</head>
    <body>12.36pm BST Virginia Crosbie (Con) says this week is Wales tourism week. Will Dowen thank all those working in the sector. And doesn’t the tips bill show the government is supporting this sector? Dowden says he has spent many happy family holidays in Wales, and will go again next year. And that’s it. PMQs is over. 12.33pm BST Chi Onwurah (Lab) says half the children in her constituency are growing up in poverty. Why is the government making it so hard for children? Dowden says the government has lifted 1.7 million people out of absolute poverty. (Absolute poverty is a measure of poverty based on what the poverty level was at the start of a government’s period in office. Over time, because of inflation, absolute poverty almost always declines.) Updated at 12.35pm BST 12.31pm BST Simon Clarke (Con) says Labour should apologise for talking down the Teesside freeport project. He says it was always meant to include private sector involvement. Dowden defends the project, and says Labour’s decision to talk it down is inexcusable. This may be a hostage to fortune. This week the Financial Times published the results of an extensive investigation by Jennifer Williams suggesting there are serious questions to answer about how this project has been funded, and whether it has been a good use of public money. The National Audit Office has been urged to investigate. 12.27pm BST Matt Western (Lab) says Rishi Sunak had to be airlifted to a pharmacy in Southampton recently after suffering from electoral misfunction. 12.26pm BST Sir Desmond Swayne (Con) aks what reason there might be for giving EU nationals the right to vote in UK elections. Their numbers are equivalent to the population of Wales, he says. Dowden says while the Tories will stop the boats, Labour will rig the votes. 12.24pm BST Dowden says the government remains committed to reforming the leasehold system. Plans will be set out later in this parliament. 12.24pm BST Dowden gives DUP leader assurance about government acting to guarantee Northern Ireland&apos;s access to UK market Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader at Westminster, says the Westminster framework could create further barriers to trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Will the government legislate to ensure Northern Ireland’s access to the British market? Dowden says the government is willing to legislate to ensure Northern Ireland has unfettered access to the UK market. There are local elections in Northern Ireland tomorrow, and so that is a valuable assurance for the DUP. 12.19pm BST Esther McVey (Con) says Travellers are causing a problem in her constituency. Dowden says unauthorised encampments can cause misery. The home secretary will have heard McVey’s comments, he says. 12.18pm BST Mhairi Black, the deputy SNP leader at Westminster, asks why Dowden ignores all the downsides of Brexit. Dowden claims the UK has had one of the fastest growth rates in the G7 since Brexit. The SNP want to undo Brexit. But they should undo the mess the SNP has left Scotland in. Black says the only thing more deluded than Dowden’s defence of Brexit is Labour’s support for it. Even Nigel Farage can admit Brexit has failed. Why can’t Dowden? Dowden says the SNP should support the government’s trade deals. The SNP has been in power for 13 years, he says. 12.15pm BST Rayner says child poverty is almost back to the level it was when Labour last inherited a mess from the Tories. The Tories have been staging a “Trump tribute act” this week, she says. They have been spouting nonsense at their “carnival of conspiracy”. When will the Tories stop blaming everyone else, and realise they are the problem? Dowden says he will proudly defend his party’s record. But Labour has lost four elections, Starmer has broken 30 promises, and under Corbyn the party let antisemitism run wild, he says. Updated at 12.22pm BST 12.12pm BST Rayner says Tories are on track to make child poverty worse Rayner says they all want minimum service levels. It is the government that is failing to provide them, because it has run services into the ground. She says the government is on track to make child poverty worse. When she was a young mum, she remembers the sick feeling in her stomach worrying about meeting her bills. What level of poverty does Dowden consider a success? Dowden says, as a comprehensive school boy, he won’t take lectures from Labour. He says the Tories have taken more than a million people out of poverty. Updated at 12.17pm BST 12.11pm BST Rayner challenges Dowden over length of NHS waiting lists Rayner says waiting lists were going up before the pandemic. Waiting lists are higher than when Rishi Sunak made his promise five months ago. Sunak has a private GP, so perhaps he does not appreciate the urgency. But she mentions a constituent who has repeatedly had an appointment delayed. When will waiting lists fall? Dowden says, if Rayner cares that much about access to healthcare, Labour should be supporting the minimum service levels in the anti-strike bill. Updated at 12.17pm BST 12.09pm BST Rayner says Dowden should spend more time following what is happening in his party, not making up what is happening in hers. She asks why the government has not met its latest target on waiting lists. Dowden says the government had to deal with the pandemic. And he says in Labour-run Wales waiting lists are also a problem. 12.08pm BST Rayner says the Tories are starting to prepare for opposition. She refers to speeches at the NatCon conference, and says Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Tories were gerrymandering with the Elections Act. She says Dowden, when he was working in No 10, said he had to listen to the radio to find out what was going on. She says, 11 years on, nothing has changed. Dowden says Rayner and Starmer are at each other’s throats. They are the Phil and Holly of British politics. (Colleagues tell me he should have said Holly and Phil.) Updated at 12.17pm BST 12.05pm BST Angela Rayner starts by saying Dowden is the third deputy she has faced in three years. And Rishi Sunak finally has a working-class friend. Pointing out that Dowden resigned as Tory chair after byelection losses, she asks who is to blame for the Tory local election results. Dowden says he was expecting to face Keir Starmer’s choice for deputy PM today, and so he thought Ed Davey would be here. And he criticises Rayner for backing Jeremy Corbyn when he was party leader. Updated at 12.18pm BST 12.03pm BST Craig Mackinlay (Con) says Amazon is allowing people to buy counterfeit stamps from China. Will the government tackle this? Dowden says if fraud is being perpetrated, the police should take action. Updated at 12.18pm BST 12.03pm BST Cat Smith (Lab) says the Royal Lancashire Infirmary was meant to be one of the 40 hospitals being refurbished by the government. Is that still the case? Dowden says the government is still committed to the programme. 12.01pm BST Oliver Dowden starts by saying the PM is travelling to Japan for the G7 summit. He congratulates Liverpool for its staging of Eurovision. 11.59am BST Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question at PMQs. PMQs Photograph: HoC 11.55am BST Oliver Dowden faces Angela Rayner at PMQs Oliver Dowden is about to get his first outing at PMQs. He was made deputy PM when Dominic Raab resigned, and he is facing Angela Rayner because Rishi Sunak is flying to the G7 summit in Japan. 11.53am BST Former Brexit minister Lord Frost criticises Gove&apos;s bill to ban no-fault evictions Lord Frost, the Tory former Brexit minister, was the key speaker at the National Conservatism conference this morning. He used his speech to criticise the plans being announced by Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, today to stop landlords evicting tenants with no reason. Frost said: The right thing to do is to reverse the powers of government in our everyday lives. The politicisation of every activity and every choice. Let’s not forget what that means. The endless hectoring. The constant suggestion that the government has the right to dictate how you behave when it has socialised the costs. The dangerous and counter-productive intrusion into private property – as Michael Gove’s renters bill will do this morning. The seeming determination to remove risk from every aspect of daily life. The belief that the government can dictate what your children are taught. The establishment of DEI [diversity, equality and inclusion] as something close to a state ideology that you must sign up to if you want to work in the public sector. The growing assumption that the government has the right to know where you are, what you spend your money on, and increasingly what you read and think. Updated at 12.05pm BST 11.48am BST As mentioned earlier (see 9.02am), Keir Starmer’s decision to depict Labour as “builders” and the Tories as “blockers” seems to be inspired by a Bagehot column in last week’s Economist. It’s a very good read. Here’s an extract. Housing policy divides the country in odd ways. Britain has fewer houses than it needs, if its European peers are anything to go by. England has fewer homes per person than every other big rich European country. Yet Britons are split on whether to catch up. According to a study by Ben Ansell, an Oxford academic and author of Why Politics Fails, an average of 37% of people in each constituency support building more local housing. But an average of 39% oppose the idea. Britain is a country of Builders and Blockers – and its political parties have each decided which group to pursue … Housing is one of the few areas in British politics where there is fundamental disagreement. Topics where voters are totally split, such as whether to leave the EU, are rare. On the big problems facing Britain – whether lousy public services or the cost of living or cutting emissions – Britons are largely agreed on what to aim for, if not on how to get there. Housing is more binary. Some voters want it; others do not. When Britain is divided, the party that can maintain its block of voters wins. In 2019 the Conservatives were able to marshal the support of “Leave” voters, while the “Remain” vote split among Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Scottish National party. Come the next election, Builders have few places to go. Blockers have plenty of choice. Updated at 12.08pm BST 11.44am BST At 12.30pm, after PMQs, there will be an urgent question in the Commons about the car industry and Brexit. Labour has tabled the UQ, and a minister from the Department for Business and Trade will respond. 11.41am BST Starmer plays down prospect of Labour committing to giving EU nationals right to vote in general elections, saying it isn&apos;t priority Although Keir Starmer used his Times interview to defend Labour’s plans to legislate to allow employees to work from home (see 10.56am), he was much less keen to defend the proposal to allow EU nationals to vote in general elections. On Monday Starmer told LBC that he could see the case for this idea (not yet party policy). But when asked about Michael Gove’s attack on the plan, Starmer implied he was having second thoughts. Steven Swinford and Henry Zeffman report: Starmer said Gove was being “hysterical” and hinted that the idea would not make it into the manifesto. “This isn’t policy,” he said. “We will debate a number of things. But … I know that because of the damaged country we’ll inherit I have to be laser-focused in government on the missions I’ve said we will deliver. We’ve got five missions. None of them involve electoral change.” Updated at 12.10pm BST 11.31am BST Starmer confirms Labour wants &apos;better Brexit deal&apos; with EU Keir Starmer has confirmed that Labour would seek to improve the Brexit deal that the UK has with the EU. Asked about the reports that the car manufacturer Stellantis wants the trade and cooperation agreement renegotiated because it believes that in its current form it puts manufacturing jobs in the UK at risk, Starmer told BBC Breakfast the UK needed “a better Brexit deal”. He said: Look, we’re not going to re-enter the EU. We do need to improve that deal. Of course we want a closer trading relationship, we absolutely do. We want to ensure that Vauxhall and many others not just survive in this country but thrive. This has been Labour’s position for some time. Last year Starmer set out a five-point plan setting out changes he wanted to see to the Brexit settlement. If Labour wins the next election, Starmer will have the opportunity to review the TCA anyway, because the treaty includes a provision for its terms to be reviewed in 2025. 11.18am BST CPRE says Starmer is &apos;absolutely right&apos; about giving councils more control to direct housebuilding The CPRE, which used to be the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, but which now calls itself the countryside charity, has given a qualified welcome to Keir Starmer’s comments about building on the green belt. It is not a full endorsement. But, given the fact that for years the CPRE has been at the forefront of protecting the green belt, Labour may have been expecting something a lot more hostile. The CPRE seems to have some reservations about what the Labour leader is saying (see 9.59am), because it says brownfield development should be prioritised. But it agrees with much of what Starmer is proposing. This is from Tom Fyans, its director of campaigns and policy. Keir Starmer is absolutely right to say developers and landowners need to be prevented from deliberately slowing the rate at which they build houses to drive up prices – local authorities need more control to direct housebuilding where it is most needed. And he’s bang on when he says targeting the green belt for ‘expensive executive housing’ upsets local communities because that’s not the homes that are needed. We’re facing a bona fide housing crisis, with an entire generation effectively priced out of home ownership. What’s more, far too many people are barely able to afford their rent. A sustained period of social housebuilding is the only practical way to deliver the truly affordable homes we so desperately need, including in rural areas. To boost economic growth, regenerate towns and city centres, and fix the housing crisis, hundreds of thousands of genuinely affordable homes need to be fast-tracked on brownfield sites, in particular land that has been previously developed and needs regeneration within the green belt. A sensible brownfield first planning policy not only protects the countryside, it offers the convenience of living near public transport, jobs and shops, meaning reduced carbon emissions and thriving urban centres. Roger Harrabin, the leading environmental commentator and journalist, is more positive about the Starmer announcement. So, Labour will allow building on green belt. Thank goodness for that. Some sections of greenbelt are really valuable, but others are not Tile Hill station in my home city Coventry, sits right on the edge of the greenbelt. It’s a good place for a village with homes and pub/shop — Roger Harrabin (@RHarrabin) May 17, 2023 10.56am BST Starmer defends Labour&apos;s plan to give employees right to work from home, dismissing claims it would harm productivity Last week the leak of a report to Labour’s national policy forum confirmed that the party intends to legislate to give people the right to flexible working, which would include the ability to work from home some of the time for many employees. In its news story on the proposal the Daily Mail said “increasing the likelihood of people working from home could jeopardise the push to improve the UK’s productivity, which trails behind some of the other major economies and is seen as vital for securing improved growth in the long term”. But this has not discouraged Keir Starmer. In his Times interview he said giving people the right to work from home was “very important to use”. He went on: Security, dignity and respect at work matters to working people. And because every good employer will tell you and every good business will tell you that if you want high productivity, if you want a well-run business, then how you treat your workforce is part of that. When it was put to Starmer that Tories claim working from home is bad for productivity, he replied: Yeah, well they voted against the minimum wage back in the day on the same basis. And now they claim it as their own. 10.42am BST Hunt tells BCC it is for businesses to &apos;find their own way through&apos; how much working from home to allow Businesses and public bodies are under constant pressure from the Jacob Rees-Mogg wing of the Conservative party to stop employees working from home and to get more of them back into the office. (The cause is also popular with some of the rightwing papers, perhaps worried that working from home is not good for sales.) But when Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, was asked about this at the BCC conference, he refused to be too prescriptive. He said it was up to businesses to “find their own way through”. He said: I think it’s something for businesses to find their own way through. There are some very exciting opportunities created by the fact that we’ve all learned to use Zoom in teams for meetings. On the other hand, there is nothing like sitting around the table, seeing people face to face developing team spirit – and I worry about the loss of creativity. When people are permanently working from home and not having those water cooler moments where they bounce ideas off each other. 10.34am BST Met was not under &apos;political pressure&apos; over coronation policing, senior offficer tells MPs A senior officer in the Metropolitan police has rejected claims that the force come under political pressure to ensure protests did not disrupt the coronation. As PA Media reports, a report in the i newspaper quoted an anonymous source saying that there had been “a very firm instruction [to the police] not to damage the reputation of the UK” by allowing disruptive protests. The Met was criticised in particular for using new powers in the Public Order Act to arrest and detain six activists from the group Republic who had been liasing with police for weeks in advance about what protest activity would be allowed. Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee, Matt Twist, the temporary assistant commissioner for Met operations, said: I felt under no pressure politically, I felt pressure to deliver a safe and secure operation, but that was because of the fact that it was a once in a lifetime event for so many people and there would be hundreds of thousands of people in London to celebrate it and also and importantly, this was the biggest protection operation we have ever run. There were 312 protected people that we managed to get in and out of the Abbey and across the footprint in about 90 minutes. So the stakes were enormously high, so I absolutely felt pressure to deliver a safe and secure operation. but that wasn’t political pressure. 10.03am BST Hunt tells BCC that bringing down inflation will take priority over cutting taxes Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has said that the government will prioritise bringing down inflation over cutting taxes. In his speech to the British Chambers of Commerce conference, he said: What I would say to people worried about levels of taxation is: I agree with that, we have to get our taxes down, particularly our business taxes down. But the worst tax of all is inflation, because inflation is tax which you get nothing back for in return. On inflation, Hunt said that although it was for the Bank of England to control it through interest rates, the government had a role to play too. He said: There’s nothing automatic about bringing down inflation. There’s a plan, we are going to stick to it. The Bank of England has a role through monetary policy and interest rates, we support them 150% with that. But we have our role in government, what I do on the fiscal side in terms of tax and spend has an influence and if markets judge that we are not getting our borrowing under control they will punish us with higher interest rates. 9.59am BST Starmer says Labour would give local authorities power to allow more building on green belt In his Times interview Keir Starmer said that Labour would give councils and residents more power to approve housebuilding on green belt land. He suggested this would lead to more homes being built (even though it is often local objections that halt development). Starmer told the Times that one problem is that often the housing that does get approved under the current system is “expensive executive housing” that might not suit local needs. He said restoring the housebuilding targets abandoned by the government would not, on its own, be enough. More building on the green belt should be allowed too, he said. But he stressed the importance of consulting communities. He said: We need to have that discussion [about building on the green belt]. But it cannot be reduced to a simple discussion of will you or will you not build on the green belt. This is why it’s important for local areas to have the power to decide where housing is going to be. Very often the objections that people have to housebuilding on the green belt are valid because the control by landowners and developers mean that the houses are proposed in areas where it’s quite obvious that there’s going to be a local concern. Give local authorities, local areas more power to decide where it will be and you alleviate that problem. So it’s not as binary or straightforward as ‘green belt, not green belt’. It’s how you direct where the housing will be. Updated at 10.11am BST 9.47am BST Minister defends Tories&apos; record on housebuilding in face of criticism from Starmer Richard Holden, the transport minister, was on the broadcast interview round this morning on behalf of the government. Asked to respond to what Keir Starmer is saying about building houses, he told Talk Radio that the Tories had a record of building homes, because 2.2m houses had been built since 2010. He also implied Starmer was being hypocritical. He said: I’m always interested to hear what the Labour leader has to say because it usually changes on a daily basis. You’ve got to keep following him closely … Like any good barrister, what we see is Keir Starmer attempting to make a different case to a different audience every time he’s got a different case in front of him. Holden did not flesh out this claim in the interview, but in their Times story Steven Swinford and Henry Zeffman quote a government source giving an example of Labour opposing housebuilding. They report: A government source highlighted the fact that Lisa Nandy, the shadow secretary for levelling up, housing and communities, recently opposed the building of homes on green belt land in her Wigan constituency. “You can’t trust a word that Starmer says on housing,” the source said. “These are more empty promises from Labour.” In her London Playbook briefing for Politco, Rosa Prince also points out that in 2021 Labour opposed the planning changes being proposed at the time by the then housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, on the grounds that they were a “developers’ charter”. Jenrick was later sacked and those changes, which would have liberalised planning rules, were abandoned because Tory backbenchers opposed them. Updated at 10.14am BST 9.32am BST Vauxhall maker says Brexit deal must be renegotiated or it could shut UK plant The Vauxhall and Fiat manufacturer Stellantis has urged the government to renegotiate rules in the Brexit deal that it says could force it to shut some of its UK operations, putting thousands of jobs at risk. Mark Sweney has the story here. Related: Vauxhall maker says Brexit deal must be renegotiated or it could shut UK plant 9.02am BST Labour are ‘builders’, Tories are ‘blockers’, says Starmer as he promises planning reform to boost housebuilding Good morning. Keir Starmer has given an interview to the Times published this morning, he is doing a media round, and he is giving a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce this afternoon. And he has got a big message to publicise: Labour will go on a building spree, and it is willing to relax planning restrictions to do so. This is what he will tell the BCC: You can’t be serious about raising productivity, about improving the supply-side capacity of our economy and about arresting our economic decline, without a plan for the windfarms, the laboratories, the warehouses and the homes this country so desperately needs. Mark my words: we will take on planning reform. We’ll bring back local housing targets. We’ll streamline the process for national infrastructure projects and commercial development and we’ll remove the veto used by big landowners to stop shovels hitting the ground. This is what he told the Times: [The Conservatives] have killed the dream, the aspiration of homeowning for a whole generation. It will fall to us to deal with that. And he has summed it up with a slogan that he has pinched wholesale from a Bagehot column in the Economist last week: Labour is on the side of the builders, not the blockers. He will tell the BCC: We choose the builders, not the blockers; the future, not the past; renewal not decline. We choose growth. In policy terms, this is not new. Starmer has been talking about the need to build more homes, and the need for planning reform, for ages. But this has become a better issue for Labour since the government abandoned plans at the end of last year to impose mandatory housebuilding targets on councils. And Rishi Sunak’s admission, in an interview last month, that he had to abandon the targets because they were too unpopular with Conservative party members, has made it easy for Labour to depict the Tories as “blockers”. I will post more from the Times interview, and the speech preview, shortly. And the Tories are accusing Labour of hypocrisy. I will post on that shortly too. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.40am: Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, speaks at the British Chambers of Commerce conference. 10am: Matt Twist, the Metropolitan police’s temporary assistant commissioner, and Chris Noble, the chief constable of Staffordshire police and the National Police Chiefs’ Council’s protest lead, give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about policing protests. At 10.45am Graham Smith, the chief executive of Republic, gives evidence. 11am: MPs start voting in the election for a new chair of the Commons culture committee. The three candidates are Damian Collins, Damian Green and Dame Caroline Dinenage. 11am: Lord Frost, the former Brexit minister, gives a speech to the final day of the National Conservatism conference. At 5.45pm Lee Anderson, the Conservative party’s deputy chair, is speaking. 12pm: Oliver Dowden, the deputy PM, faces Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, at PMQs. Sunak is flying to Japan for the G7 summit. 3.20pm: Starmer speaks at the BCC conference. Also, at some point today Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, is publishing the renters (reform) bill.

    <head>‘This is about saving lives’: the Texas Democrat fighting for gun control and abortion rights</head>
    <body>Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett was in Dallas when the shocking news broke. At a shopping mall in the suburb of Allen, a gunman shot and killed eight people, including three children. He was later revealed to have posted photos online displaying Nazi tattoos on his arm and torso. “I was texting my mom to see where she was, because it’s a suburb 30 miles north of my district, and on the weekends she usually goes shopping,” Crockett, 42, recalls in an interview at her office in Washington. “She texted me: ‘I’m at my friend’s house. Why?’ ‘Because of Allen.’ ‘What’s going on in Allen?’ And I’m like, ‘There’s a shooting at the mall.” Related: US voting rights champion Jasmine Crockett: ‘I need everyone to feel a sense of urgency’ Crockett was already scheduled for an interview on the MSNBC network, and spent the next hours responding on air to a developing story that now has a sickening deja vu quality in America, with the nation’s political class seemingly paralysed. The Democrat reflects: “It’s heartbreaking. At the end of the day, as we saw the carnage, I wasn’t thinking or wondering, well, is that a Democrat or Republican or independent? I was thinking, ‘We’ve got to do better,’ and honestly, those bullets didn’t have R, D or I on them, either.” Crockett can see the failings and follies of Washington on this and other issues through fresh eyes. The former lawyer and Texas state representative was sworn in last January to represent Texas’s 30th congressional district, which is home to 750,000 people and includes portions of Dallas and Tarrant counties. She is the first Black woman to serve as freshman leadership representative. After the mass shooting in Allen, she saw firsthand Republicans’ refusal to budge on gun safety. Ted Cruz, senator for Texas, and Keith Self, a freshman congressman who represents Allen, both offered prayers for the families but offered no meaningful solutions. Crockett adds: “No one seemingly wants to take up the conversation about the far-right extremism that he had. No one wants to accept that part of the chaos and carnage is actually being stoked by the rhetoric that is being spewed by the Republican party.” If Congress took responsibility, she argues, it could pass smart gun legislation instead of staging yet another partisan brawl. “I myself am a Texan. I own a gun – or a couple. I am licensed to carry. I am all the things. But it’s all or nothing, ‘Oh, well, Democrats just want to take your guns away.’ No.” People visit the memorial set up near the scene of a mass shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets mall in Allen, Texas, after eight people were killed on 6 May. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images She does support Joe Biden’s call for an assault weapons ban. “There are definitely guns that we want to take away because it’s the equivalent of some of these people having cannon; I’m sorry, but it’s not OK for my next-door neighbor to have a cannon. “If we want to minimise the carnage and damage that is done when someone is evil and is just going to do what they do, this is about mitigation, this is about saving lives. People literally have almost no chance of surviving when some of these weapons are used. I don’t understand why we need them.” She describes Republicans as “cowards” on the issue and believes that their stance can be explained by a primary election system that rewards extremism and discourages moderation. This, in turn, flows from gerrymandering – the manipulation of district boundaries to favor one party – made easier by erosion of the Voting Rights Act. “People have told me, ‘I’ll lose my primary if I don’t do this,’ even if it’s completely against what even the majority of their district wants because of who’s going to show up in that primary.” Two years ago, Crockett was among Democrats in the Texas legislature who fled Austin for Washington to deny a quorum to Republicans seeking to overhaul elections and impose new voting restrictions. The standoff lasted for 38 consecutive days and remains one of the dramatic showdowns over voting rights in America. Crockett believes there was a lesson for national Democrats: sometimes you have to fight fire with fire. Related: ‘I think it kicked ass’: how Texas Democrats fought for voting rights by fleeing the state “I’ve been all over the state of Texas for various campaigns and I talk to people and ask them, why is it that you don’t want to vote? Honestly, I have heard more than once that Democrats are weak. We are not weak, but there is this perception.” She added: “I was only the 22nd black woman ever elected to the Texas House, and I wouldn’t be here but for people having courage. At some point in time we can’t just rely on the traditions and sit here because it doesn’t work if both sides aren’t in and, at this point in time, I’ve decided that the Republicans are not in for democracy. So we have to be in.” Republicans are determined to retain power by any means necessary, she argues, because they know their policies do not align with the majority of Americans. She cites examples such as abortion bans, firmly rejected by voters in Kansas, and student loan forgiveness, popular in opinion polls, as evidence that Democrats are more in touch with public sentiment. Yet this does not always translate at the ballot box as Republican tout themselves as the party of middle America and Democrats as the party of coastal elites. “It’s hard to understand how we are failing at communicating that, no matter if you’re in urban America or if you’re in rural America, we’re fighting for you.” Is it lonely to be a Democrat in Texas? The Lone Star State has gone red in 11 consecutive presidential elections from Ronald Reagan in 1980 to Donald Trump in 2020. Both its senators and its governor are Republicans. Counterintuitively, however, Crockett contends that Texas is already a blue state. “People think I’m crazy because it’s so extreme and all we get is the extreme stories. But I believe my state is blue because we’re probably the only majority-minority state that is ‘red’; most majority-minority states are blue. So demographically it’s there.” But despite record turnout in 2020, Texas ranked 44th out of 50 states in terms of ballots counted as a proportion of the total voting-eligible population, according to the United States Elections Project. Crockett said: “We continually have one of the lowest voter turnouts in the entire country. If you make it difficult to access the ballot box, then you can have this minority rule.” Another opportunity to change the narrative of Texas politics will come in next year’s presidential election. When Crockett speaks to young people, she finds that their first concern is guns and their second is voting rights. Since the overturning of Roe v Wade by the supreme court, Republicans have been struggling to defend unpopular restrictions on abortion or even a potential national ban. US Representative Jasmine Crockett speaks during a news conference calling for equal abortion access on Capitol Hill. Photograph: Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images “As a criminal defence attorney, I have had to deal with cases where fathers were raping their little girls. This is the reality of some of the things that happen and then telling that little girl you can’t do anything about it? There are people that aren’t necessarily for abortion for whatever reasons but they understand that you can’t just say under no circumstances, we’re not doing this, period, ever. “Honestly, the Republicans have thrown us a bone, and it is going to be moms and young people.” Biden was elected on a vow to heal the soul of the nation after the horror of white supremacists and neo-Nazis marching in Charlottesville, Virginia. But the president’s efforts to pursue racial justice through police reform and voting rights stalled in the Senate while Trump still looms large in the political landscape. The government has warned racially motivated extremists pose a bigger terrorism threat than potential attacks from overseas. Crockett admits: “We’ve got an affirmative action case in the supreme court and I’m sure the darkest one [Justice Clarence Thomas] on the supreme court is probably gonna lead the charge in getting rid of it. Then it’s like, ‘Oh, see? The Black man on the supreme court said it.’ It’s ridiculous. We also know, especially in the state of Texas, that our governor is going after DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion].” But, if Biden faces Trump in the race for the White House again, Crockett believes the Democrat will repeat his 2020 victory, in part because of LGBTQ+ voters and young voters who feel they are under attack. But what of the Black voters who were so fundamental to Biden’s success? “It’s always complicated for the African American community but, if we make the investments, then we’re fine. Black people for the longest have felt like they have carried this country, whether it is building literally these houses that I sit in right now, or showing up and being the backbone of the Democratic vote. It is a tough conversation to have with Black folk.” This was a crucial motivation for Crockett to become the freshman representative to leadership. “I thought, golly, I have enough on my plate trying to figure out how to be a member of Congress but it was time that we are at the table. There had not been a Black woman elected to leadership in the Democratic caucus since Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman in Congress. “It is important I make it clear that we are making strides, ever so slightly. It’s even a fight within our party. A lot of times there’s this idea that we should paint everything as if it’s perfect and I don’t subscribe to it. I subscribe to being real and most people respect when they feel like you’re being honest and real.” Crockett has to head off to the House chamber to cast a vote. But first she shares another thought. “Nothing in this world is perfect, but at least the Democrats are fighting for a more perfect union. The Republicans are not. “I am in leadership because I think a Black woman’s voice needs to be at the table as we are crafting our messages, as we are prioritising our voters. That’s necessary, and so that’s the role that I intend to continue to play – fight for the courting of Black voters, fight for listening to what their priorities are, fight for them to truly believe that they will be heard if they show up.”</body>

    <head>F1 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix cancelled due to flooding in northern Italy</head>
    <body>This weekend’s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix has been cancelled after Formula One, the local authorities and the promoter in Imola agreed that it was not safe to proceed because of the risks of flooding caused by severe weather. F1 also was unwilling potentially to add to the burden on the community and emergency services in the region. It is understood the race is highly unlikely to be rescheduled for later in the year. The FIA said in a statement on its website: “Following discussions between Formula 1, the President of the FIA, the competent authorities – including the relevant Ministers, the President of the Automobile Club of Italy, the President of Emilia-Romagna Region, the Mayor of the City and the promoter – the decision has been taken not to proceed with the Grand Prix weekend at Imola.

If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version. In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications. Turn on sport notifications. “The decision has been taken because it is not possible to safely hold the event for our fans, the teams and our personnel and it is the right and responsible thing to do given the situation faced by the towns and cities in the region. It would not be right to put further pressure on the local authorities and emergency services at this difficult time.” Related: Devastating floods in Italy claim lives and leave thousands homeless Stefano Domenicali, the head of Formula One, said: “It is such a tragedy to see what has happened to Imola and Emilia-Romagna, the town and region that I grew up in, and my thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the flooding and the families and communities affected. “I want to express my gratitude and admiration for the incredible emergency services who are working tirelessly to help those who need help and alleviate the situation – they are heroes and the whole of Italy is proud of them. “The decision that has been taken is the right one for everyone in the local communities and the F1 family as we need to ensure safety and not create extra burden for the authorities while they deal with this very awful situation.” The decision came after Italy’s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, called for the race to be postponed as the extreme weather conditions hit the region. Salvini, who is also Italy’s transport minister, said in a statement it was “imperative to concentrate all efforts on coping with the emergency”, including avoiding a traffic overload in the area, which has been battered by bad weather in recent days. “Let’s dedicate ourselves to relief efforts,” he said. That came after Formula One and the authorities in Imola told teams and personnel not to attend the circuit on Wednesday due to the risks of flooding caused by severe weather. The Emilia Romagna region has been placed under a red threat-level warning from the Italian authorities because of persistent heavy rain that threatens to cause flooding and landslides. On Tuesday the F1 paddock at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari was evacuated as a precaution because of the risk of flooding from the adjacent Santerno river, which runs within metres of the paddock and could burst its banks. Elsewhere in Italy, adverse weather conditions have affected cycling’s Giro d’Italia as well as interrupting play at the Italian Open tennis tournament in Rome. Denmark’s Magnus Cort, who won stage 10 of the Giro in Viareggio on Tuesday, said it had been “one of the hardest days I’ve spent on the bike”. The Emilia Romagna region has been badly affected by torrential rain which caused extensive flooding, killing two people and forcing hundreds to be evacuated from their homes, earlier this month.</body>

    <head>From horrific jokes about dog sex to ruining Succession: AI’s terrible attempt to write TV</head>
    <body>The strike by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) isn’t simply about securing better fees for screenwriters. It touches on something much bigger: making sure that screenwriting will continue to exist as a profession. Recently, at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, a number of executives sang the praises of AI programs such as ChatGPT. “In the next three years, you’re going to see a movie that was written by AI made … a good one,” said film producer Todd Lieberman. Fox Entertainment CEO Rob Wade added: “Not just scripts. Editing, all of it … storyboarding a movie, anything … AI in the future, maybe not next year or the year after, but if we’re talking 10 years? AI is going to be able to do absolutely all of these things.” Television written by AI is a terrifying prospect. Civilisation was built by humans telling stories. We’ve been doing it for tens of thousands of years, so the prospect of giving all of that up and relying on the equivalent of a random number generator to save executives a few pennies is horrifying. Still, there is at least some good news: for now, AI absolutely sucks when it comes to screenwriting. To test the capability of AI’s current powers, I ask ChatGPT to mimic some of the biggest television moments of recent years – and it doesn’t fare well. First I ask it to replicate what might go down as the standout TV sequence of the year: the death of Logan Roy on Succession. On the show, the death plays out in a fog of deep uncertainty, as the Roy children struggle to understand what has happened. I try to get ChatGPT to replicate the scene with the prompt: “Write a scene from a television drama. A man has died on board a private aircraft. His three children are told about this via a phone call from the estranged husband of one of the children.” What comes out can best be described as Bad Succession: SHIV (on phone, hesitant): Hello, Tom? TOM (gently): Shiv, it’s Tom. I have some devastating news. Your father … he’s gone. Roman’s eyes widen with shock as he clutches his chest. Kendall and Shiv share a look of disbelief. KENDALL (angry): What do you mean, he’s gone? Is he missing? ROMAN (desperate): No, Kendall, he means … Dad is dead. Kendall slams his fist against the wall, the sound reverberating through the room. KENDALL (broken): We need to see it for ourselves. ROMAN (nodding): You’re right, Kendall. We can’t just sit here. Roman takes a deep breath, summoning his strength. ROMAN (resolute): Let’s go. We need to be there for each other now more than ever. They rise together, a united front in the face of tragedy, ready to confront the painful reality that awaits them. Rhea Seehorn as Kim and Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy in Better Call Saul. Photograph: Sony/AMC/Netflix/Kobal/Shutterstock I have a similar response when I ask ChatGPT to recreate my favourite TV scene of the past 12 months, the showdown in Better Call Saul where Kim leaves Jimmy because she realises that they bring out the worst in each other. On TV, this leads to the devastating line: “I love you, but so what?” The best ChatGPT manages is this blunt exchange: JIMMY: “I know that I love you, Kim. And I know that you love me. We just need to figure out how to move past this.” KIM (squeezing his hand): “I love you, too, Jimmy. But I don’t know if I can ever forgive myself for what we did.” “Are we all going to be watching completely AI written films and TV in the next few years?” says Joe Barton, writer of shows such as Giri/Haji and The Lazarus Project. “I guess it’s possible, but I don’t think it’s going to go that far. Whether it’s subconscious or not, I think audiences are drawn to humanity and fallibility in the things they consume. I think they want authenticity.” When the AI is set to work on creating comedy, the results are worse by leagues. Prompted to recreate the masterful Coffin Flop sketch from I Think You Should Leave – in which a spokesperson embarks on an increasingly deranged rant about the cancellation of a show where naked bodies fall out of coffins at funerals – it comes up with this mess: “I implore you, the fans of our channel. Rise up! Stand with us in this fight. Write to your local lawmakers, your MPs, your congressmen, your senators, your dogs. Let them know that you won’t stand for this injustice. That you demand the right to watch naked people falling out of coffins, just like we demand the right to show it!” Which, you have to admit, is not up to the original: “They’re saying we don’t have permissions of the family. I said we don’t need permissions of the family. We’re allowed to show ’em nude ’cause they ain’t got no soul.” Danny (Jon Pointing) and Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) in Big Boys. Photograph: Kevin Baker/Channel 4 Worse happens when I feed in the premise of Jack Rooke’s Big Boys, the Bafta-nominated sitcom about a young gay man and his straight best friend. On screen, Big Boys conveys more touching subtleties about modern masculinity than almost anything else on TV. Meanwhile, ChatGPT throws up this aggressively two-dimensional alternative: DANNY: (pouting) Ugh, I can’t concentrate with all of your Grindr notifications going off every five seconds. JACK: (smiling) Sorry, I can’t help it if I’m popular. DANNY: (grinning) Yeah, but you could at least turn the volume down. Suddenly, Jack’s phone rings, and he eagerly picks it up. JACK: (on phone) Hello? Oh, hey, Mark. Yeah, I’m free tonight. (smirks at Danny) Looks like I’m getting lucky again. DANNY: (rolling his eyes) Great, another one-night stand. I send this new Big Boys scene to Rooke, to see if he would be scared of AI taking his job. Within minutes he responds: “AI doesn’t have a dead dad it can exploit for an emotionally satisfying televisual narrative! AI can’t drink poppers aged 19!” So, not concerned? “I’m more concerned with telly execs not paying me fairly and competitively,” he replies. I try once more to get ChatGPT to write a funny scene, but its suggestion for a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode in which Jeff Garlin becomes sexually aroused by a golden retriever who can type (JEFF: “She’s smoking hot!” LARRY: “Jeff, that’s a dog!”) is so far off the mark I decided to give up. I try a new tactic. Forget writing: how would ChatGPT improve the Game of Thrones finale? And here the machine does well, coming up with a comprehensive five-point plan. “Daenerys’s character arc in the final season was controversial, with many fans feeling that her descent into madness was rushed and not fully developed,” it says. “To improve this, the writers could have explored her growing isolation and paranoia, as well as the psychological toll of her losses and failures. This could have been done through additional scenes or dialogue that showed her mental state deteriorating over time.” So perhaps this is the future of AI. As a writer, it is still wildly hack-ish. But as a supplement to human writers – helping out with grunt work, questioning flaws – there is a chance that it might come in useful. That is something Barton can imagine, too. “I don’t think that audiences are ever going to prefer being told a story by a machine over a person,” he says. “Where I do think AI is going to come in useful is execs using it to develop ideas or come up with solutions to structure and plot. In fact, I’d be surprised if they’re not already. AI is going to change the industry, but the degree to which it damages it or not is down to how we react now.”</body>

    <head>Intruder at home of Biden adviser Jake Sullivan bypassed Secret Service agents</head>
    <body>The US Secret Service was investigating after an apparently intoxicated and confused man walked past agents and into the Washington home of Joe Biden’s national security adviser. Related: Zero Fail review: US Secret Service as presidential protectors – and drunken frat boys Jake Sullivan confronted the man and told him to leave, the Washington Post first reported, of an incident that happened at about 3am one night in late April. There were no signs of forced entry. The Post said: “Sullivan has a round-the-clock Secret Service detail. But agents stationed outside the house were unaware that an intruder had gotten inside … until the man had already left and Sullivan came outside to alert the agents.” A Secret Service spokesperson said: “While the protectee was unharmed, we are taking this matter seriously and have opened a comprehensive mission assurance investigation to review all facets of what occurred. Any deviation from our protective protocols is unacceptable and if discovered, personnel will be held accountable. “Modifications to the protective posture have also been made to ensure additional security layers are in place as we conduct this comprehensive review.” National security advisers received increased protection after the discovery in 2021 of an alleged Iranian plot to kill John Bolton, the third such adviser to Donald Trump. Carol Leonnig, a Post reporter and the author of a recent book about the Secret Service, told MSNBC the Bolton plot was “a reason sources reached out to us”. “An Iranian military official has been charged with paying someone to try to kill [John Bolton] on US soil. So that’s why Jake Sullivan has 24/7 protection, and we would hope as Americans protecting him would be a little tighter than somebody being able to get into his home in the middle of the night.” Attacks on US politicians and public officials are a matter of increasing concern. Last October, a man entered the San Francisco home of Nancy Pelosi, the former US House speaker, who is guarded by US Capitol police. The intruder attacked her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer. In Fairfax, Virginia, earlier this week, a man carrying a metal baseball bat attacked staff and damaged property at the district office of Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of Congress. Connolly was not present. Two staffers were taken to hospital. The 49-year-old man was reported to have a history of mental illness. The Post said there was no evidence the intruder at Sullivan’s house intended to do him harm. Nonetheless, Secret Service lapses are always high-profile, given the seniority of the officials they protect. Related: Trump family members got ‘inappropriately close’ to Secret Service agents, book claims In 2009, a socialite couple seeking reality TV fame managed to crash Barack Obama’s first state dinner as president, in honour of the prime minister of India. In a more alarming incident, in 2017, a man scaled a 5ft fence by the US treasury department then spent 16 minutes on White House grounds. The intruder was found to be carrying two cans of Mace spray, a passport, a computer and a book by Donald Trump. He told agents he was a friend of the president and had an appointment. Trump was home at the time. Of the incident at Sullivan’s home, Leonnig said: “The real big alarm bell here is that the Secret Service was not aware that a person basically walked right into his house in the middle of the night.” Thomas S Warrick, an Atlantic Council member and security expert, told CBS News: “This should not have happened. Absolutely not. And especially where there are hostile nation states targeting US officials on US soil.”</body>

    <head>From European glory to relegation: the decline of Turbine Potsdam</head>
    <body>At around 3pm on Saturday 13 May, a quiet descended around the Karl-Liebknecht-Stadion. Set in the quaint, leafy Potsdam suburb of Babelsberg, a stadium that has witnessed so many of its residents’ highest moments was now playing host to their worst. As the whistle blew on Turbine Potsdam’s 5-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen, the curtain finally came down on their 26-year period in the top flight of German football. The home fans watching on were well aware they were witnessing a moment in history; one they would all probably rather forget. The end of an era, as one of the Frauen-Bundesliga’s last independent teams dropped out of the division. It was a result that sent shockwaves through women’s football far beyond German shores. While Potsdam’s decline has been on the cards for some time, it is still gut-wrenching to see one of the historic trailblazers finally fall. For Potsdam’s remarkable story is one that is wrapped so intrinsically with its country’s history – a small team in the east defying the odds to become one of its most successful. Related: Janine van Wyk: a life of smashing down barriers in South Africa Potsdam were founded in 1971 on the factory floor of an energy company in East Germany. A notice was pinned to the board reading: “Establishing women’s football team. Please get in contact. March 3, 1971”. Bernd Schröder took on the role as coach with the aim of playing competitively – needless to say that, in the 1970s, this was considered a pipe dream. Schröder persisted, recruiting players and teaching them how to play. Battling against restrictions and acceptance, his team would go on to win the East Germany women’s title six times. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, testing times followed as players departed. Potsdam eventually won promotion to a two-group Frauen-Bundesliga before qualifying for the new single-tier top league in 1997. Playing in the top division, and the return of Schröder as head coach, saw Potsdam attract real talent. The German internationals Ariane Hingst and Conny Pohlers arrived at the club. Along with Nadine Angerer, they would later become World Cup winners. Since 2004, the Turbines have been crowned winners of the Frauen-Bundesliga six times, lifted three DFB-Pokals, and won two Champions League trophies. Turbine Potsdam players celebrate after beating Lyon on penalties in the 2010 Women’s Champions League final. Photograph: Sergio Barrenechea/EPA To this day, Potsdam remain the only east German team to win the unified league. In total, their 17 major trophies have made them one of the country’s most prolific domestic teams. Fast forward over a decade since their last piece of silverware, though, and the difference could not be starker. Despite finishing fourth last year, this campaign has been dire. With just eight points from 20 games, the team have struggled to find their way on and off the pitch. The reasons behind Potsdam’s demise are multi-faceted. While women’s football has enjoyed a lightning rise in recent years, its growth has made it more and more difficult for clubs to survive without the backing of an established men’s team. Other than perhaps in the USA, this trend has been seen worldwide, with the resources and infrastructure of the bigger football machines vastly outweighing those who are independent. In Germany, it has seen the success of Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg on the women’s side, and looking to the future, the likes of RB Leipzig (already promoted to the Frauen-Bundesliga next season) and Borussia Dortmund are making moves. It raises the question about whether independent teams can survive in this era. In the current era, Potsdam have struggled. A three-year collaborative deal with Hertha Berlin brought little relief, withHertha eventually opting to fund their own women’s setup.

Photograph: Getty Images/Bongarts Financial problems and lack of resources have partnered with internal struggles and a lack of planning at management level. In 2021, Tabea Kemme, a former captain and club legend, attempted to become the league’s first female president and turn her old team’s fortunes around. She lost out to the incumbent, Rolf Kutzmutz, to the dismay of many. A year later Kutzmutz, the head coach Sofian Chahed and around 12 players departed, leading to turmoil on the pitch. Rationally, the reasons for the Turbines’ troubles are clear to see. Emotionally, however, it is harder to take. Visits to Babelsberg formed an early part of my own career. The treat of a seven-goal thriller against Arsenal in 2012 lives long in the memory – the magic of a European night; the buzz of the crowd; the topsy-turvy battle on the pitch. The Gunners edged through that day - in hindsight, it was probably at the start of the German side’s demise. It is sad to wonder if Potsdam will ever see those nights again. A restructure and radical thinking in the coming years is needed for them to even have a chance.

    <head>Top 10 strangest alien invasion novels</head>
    <body>Say the words “alien invasion” and the stories most people think of are those told in movies like Roland Emmerich’s Independence Day (1996), in which the battle lines between good and evil are cleanly divided. HG Wells dreamed up this template in 1897, with Martian invaders laying waste the home counties in The War of the Worlds. Half a century later, John Wyndham’s The Kraken Wakes (1953) envisaged the melting of the ice caps not as the by-product of human negligence but as the result of a hostile intervention by alien forces. In writing my novel Conquest, I was determined to subvert these violent stereotypes. What I find most compelling about earlier alien invasion narratives is the way they highlight how vulnerable we are, not to aliens so much as our own irrational behaviour in the face of the unknown. I wanted to reveal the theme of alien invasion as infinitely flexible, adapting itself to subtle, ambiguous stories in which the divide between human and alien is not always clear cut. My protagonist Frank Landau stands in permanent danger of losing his sanity to his obsessions. And yet Frank has a brilliant mind; in many ways, he is the most sensitive and compassionate individual in the novel. The tension between these two truths is the engine that drives Conquest, and it is this irreconcilable contradiction between delusion and epiphany I find most fascinating in other alien invasion stories. Here are 10 of my favourites: 1. Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer Vandermeer’s Southern Reach trilogy charts the exploration of alien incursions in a remote, segregated area of wilderness that keeps expanding. The scientists who venture into Area X find it impossible to communicate the reality of their experiences there, a failure of language that makes the encounter all the more traumatic. 2. How High We Go in the Dark by Sequoia Nagamatsu The alien presence in this book was on Earth all the time: a prehistoric virus, released from melting permafrost as the result of climate change. Nagamatsu’s subtle, heartfelt novel is constructed as a series of linked stories, beginning with the discovery of the virus and moving forward through time to reveal a world irrevocably altered by the resulting pandemic, and not always for the worse. 3. The Book of Strange New Things by Michel Faber In Faber’s novel, we are the invading aliens, and the book’s protagonist, Peter Leigh, travels to the planet Oasis as a Christian missionary. His wife, Bea, is left behind on an Earth that is becoming increasingly divided through social upheavals resulting from climate change. Faber’s vision is bleak, alienating, even frightening, but there is redemption here too. This novel’s strange, hypnotic power poses questions that linger long after reading. 4. Agents of Dreamland by Caitlín R Kiernan The first in a trilogy of taut novellas that combine the bitter essence of noir with the cosmic terror of Lovecraft, Agents of Dreamland recounts the secret history of shadowy operatives who wrestle, like angels and demons, for the soul and continuing existence of the human race. The battle takes place in a world grown stale and grubby from government corruption, where consensus reality is steadily becoming eroded. Kiernan’s language and manner of telling manages to be both lyrical and sharp as thorns. In the zone … Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy in Stalker, Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1979 adaptation of Roadside Picnic. Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy 5. Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky At some point in the recent past, aliens visited Earth. They left no trace, other than the curiously altered “zones” littered with mysterious relics, some wondrous, some deadly. These objects have no apparent purpose, but exert a powerful influence on all who encounter them. Red Schuhart is a “stalker”, earning a perilous living guiding fortune-hunters and thrill-seekers through the zone. This book – translated from the Russian by Antonina W Bouis – is harsh, tender, magical and, like all Soviet science fiction, full of double meanings. 6. XX by Rian Hughes A radio telescope at Jodrell Bank has picked up a signal believed to be of extra-terrestrial origin. Jack Fenwick, an expert in the developing science of artificial intelligence, is tasked with interpreting the signal and locating its source. The plotline of XX could be straight out of Fred Hoyle or Arthur C Clarke. But there the similarity ends, for Hughes, a comic book artist and designer of typefaces, knows science fiction well enough to push its boundaries. Hughes’s central interest lies with text itself, and how it might be manipulated to alter the reader’s perception of reality. To read XX is to glimpse the alien first-hand, if only from the corner of your eye. 7. The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again by M John Harrison Harrison’s Goldsmiths prize-winning novel is ostensibly the story of Shaw and Victoria, two ex-lovers each caught in the jaws of a mid-life crisis. Their reality becomes gradually destabilised as each comes to suspect that they are witnessing the dawn of a new world order. Being characters in a Harrison narrative, their reaction to the catastrophe is somewhat muted. If you are not already a Harrison reader, this novel – as acute a portrait as any of the way we live now – is the place to start. 8. The Employees by Olga Ravn This unfolds as a series of individual reports filed by crew members, both human and AI, working aboard an interdimensional spacecraft. The crew has been entrusted with the care of a number of alien artefacts, strange objects that might almost have come from the zone in Roadside Picnic. As their mysterious journey continues, the employees begin to experience altered states, hallucinations and separation anxiety, seemingly as a direct result of their contact with the alien. This exquisitely strange short novel, translated from the Danish by Martin Aitken, began life as the textual accompaniment to an art installation by Danish artist Lea Guldditte Hestelund. Its mission: to investigate the nature of being human. 9. Lagoon by Nnedi Okorafor With its jump cuts and tessellations, Okorafor’s playful, almost filmic account of an alien expedition to the city of Lagos feels unlike any alien invasion story you might have read before. Science fiction cohabits with fantasy to produce a vigorous, gorgeous mutation teeming with deft postmodernist touches: chapters told from non-human points of view, snapshots of reportage, moments when Okorafor breaks the fourth wall to ask how readers might have reacted had they been there. A joyously experimental text, Lagoon shimmers with the delirium and chaos that might be expected from an alien visit. Related: Top 10 spaceships in fiction 10. Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang Chiang’s 1999 novella is one of the most subtle and life-affirming explorations of language, time and perception to be found in all of science fiction. Linguist Louise Banks is attempting to unravel the seemingly insoluble mystery of how to communicate with the alien “heptapods” that have landed on Earth. At the same time, she is trying to come to terms with the death of her daughter. As with all Chiang’s fiction, the story unfolds through pursuing a deeper understanding of a stated reality, in this instance an entirely alien language that seems to have no human equivalent. Denis Villeneuve’s 2016 film adaptation Arrival is a fine piece of work, but Chiang’s original story is even better, engaging the emotions and the intellect with equal force. • Conquest by Nina Allan is published by riverrun.

    <head>How to make ceviche – recipe</head>
    <body>The pleasures of Latin American cuisine are still far too little known in the UK. Ceviche, which is popular from Panama to Peru, where it’s the official national dish, is a good place to start for fish-lovers, because it’s quick and easy to make, yet far more than the sum of its few parts. An ideal – and very healthy – starter or light lunch. Prep 10 min Marinate 10 min Serves 2 ½ red onion, trimmed and peeled 250g sustainably sourced sea bass or sea bream fillets, skinned and boned (see step 2) ½ tsp fine salt, plus extra to season Juice of 4 limes Juice of ½ orange 1 red chilli, mild or hot as you prefer, or 1 tsp aji amarillo paste (optional) 1 small bunch coriander, roughly chopped 1 Chop and soak the onion Finely chop the onion (or use a shallot instead or, at a pinch, a yellow or spring onion, though those last two lack the sweetness that makes red onion the best choice). Put the onion in a bowl of iced water, and leave to soak for five minutes while you prepare the fish – the onion will soften in flavour, so it won’t overpower the delicate seafood later. 2 A word on the fish The fish in ceviche is not cooked, but marinated in acidic ingredients that denature the proteins in much the same way that heat would. This gives it a dryer, firmer texture, so it’s important to choose a species that’s robust enough to stand up to such treatment. I find a firm-fleshed white fish such as sea bass or bream works best. 3 Alternative seafood That said, even in ceviche’s home region, no single species is particularly favoured – inland, freshwater fish such as trout or piranha might be used, while at the coast, tilapia, octopus or shellfish such as clams, prawns and even barnacles are common – so play around as you fancy, but remember to adjust the marinating time to suit both the seafood you use and your own tastes. 4 Dice the fish evenly Cut whatever fish you’re using into roughly 1½-2cm chunks – if they’re too wildly different in size, the fish will “cook” at different rates. You could slice it very thinly for a more elegant, restaurant-style presentation, but I find this eliminates the pleasing contrast between the soft middle and the cooked exterior, so I prefer to dice it. 5 Salt the fish and prep the citrus Put the fish in a medium bowl with half a teaspoon of salt, then rub it in gently – I find it easiest to do this with my hands. Leave it to sit for a minute while you prepare the citrus. Juice the limes and orange (or use limes alone, or seville oranges, when in season) directly into the fish bowl, and add a little of their grated zest, if you like, though don’t go overboard. 6 Add the chilli Finely shred the chilli, if using, removing the seeds and pith if you’re averse to heat, then stir into the fish, or dollop the paste on top and toss to combine. (Aji amarillo is a hot yet fruity chilli that’s hard to find in the UK, though you can buy it powdered or as a ready-mixed paste online.) 7 Macerate for 10 minutes Leave the fish to sit for about 10 minutes – traditionally, the marination time was several hours, to allow the acid to penetrate the fish properly, “cooking” it all the way through, but in the past few decades, the trend has been for a shorter soak, so the centre of the fish remains raw. Experiment to see what suits your taste. 8 Finishing touches Meanwhile, roughly chop the coriander (or parsley, if you prefer). Once the ceviche is sufficiently marinated to your liking, check the seasoning, and adjust as necessary – a little more salt, perhaps, or orange juice for sweetness. Stir in the coriander, then divide the fish and its marinade between two bowls and serve immediately. 9 Serving suggestions It’s delicious on its own, but you can bulk ceviche out by serving it with a sprinkling of giant corn kernels, some plantain chips (make your own or buy one of the Caribbean brands) or wedges of steamed, boiled or baked sweet potato. It’s also pretty good on tacos or with unseasoned tortilla chips, Central American-style. The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

    <head>Here’s what I want: a hung parliament. Let me tell you why</head>
    <body>The best outcome for the next election will not appear on the ballot paper, and is already the target of a hostile and escalating press campaign. It hardly needs to be said that a renewed mandate for Tory rule will be an obvious catastrophe for the country. No government in British democratic history can be considered such a devastating failure, whether on objective measures – weak growth, an unprecedented squeeze in living standards, declining life expectancy and crisis-ridden public services – or on its own terms. To its critics, Margaret Thatcher’s administration represented a nightmare, but its cheerleaders can recite a long list of what they would consider proud achievements: mass privatisation, smashing trade union power, slashing taxes on the rich and flogging off council houses. What would an equivalent score card look like for 13 years of Tory rule? Brexit is its defining innovation – and who even pretends that’s going well these days? But that is not to say that a majority Labour government will save a nation from its most acute turmoil since the war. Having jettisoned the core pledges he made to become Labour leader, Keir Starmer has failed to offer a coherent vision for the country he seeks to lead. Labour is now run by Blairite devotees, who hark back to the latter half of their icon’s time in office, an era defined by privatisation, attacks on civil liberties and the war in Iraq. Related: Are you hoping for a progressive alliance to oust the Tories? Don’t hold your breath | Martin Kettle The best bet is a hung parliament that finally frees British democracy. This could be done in two ways. One is to expand the franchise. It is striking that the British right is currently accusing Labour of seeking to “rig” elections by giving the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, and granting it to EU citizens who are long-time British residents. Even Jacob Rees-Mogg has admitted that the Tories’ compulsory voter ID policy – a “solution” in search of the near non-existent problem of voter fraud – was an attempt to gerrymander elections. The Tories know that restricting the right to vote helps them, while expanding democracy hurts them. In a hung parliament, there will be a majority for franchise expansion and perhaps automatic voter registration. The other is to scrap an outdated electoral system in favour of proportional representation. There is no prospect of this happening if Starmer secures a majority. Though he led Labour members to believe he supported voter reform when he stood for leader, he has – true to form – U-turned. Instead, the Liberal Democrats and other parties should demand a referendum on abandoning first past the post. That means learning the lessons from their ruinous coalition with the Tories – when the party helped kill faith in the democratic process by abandoning their pledge to scrap tuition fees, and accepted a referendum on the alternative vote, a bad electoral system that can deliver even less proportionate results than our own. The Tories and their media allies are already portraying such a move as a recipe for permanent chaos. Given the havoc we have endured since the Conservatives won an 80-seat majority, such claims merit derision. Under PR, parties to the left would gain a substantial number of seats, either through the creation of a new political movement, or the existing Green party being beefed up by mass defections from Labour’s embattled socialist flank. But Starmer’s allies did not expend so much energy crushing the party’s left to then spend political eternity having to negotiate coalition agreements with their defeated enemies. Neither can they be certain they would remain the senior partners: in France, the centre-left had to accept a junior position in an alliance with Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s more radical movement. This shift in the electoral system would cure a looming political crisis. Millions of Britons support, say, public ownership, scrapping tuition fees and putting up taxes for the rich. Starmer’s allies are stitching up parliamentary selections to ensure that MPs who advocate such policies no longer exist, disenfranchising a significant section of public opinion. In the Corbyn era, Labour could be accurately described as a loveless marriage between left and right: today, the left is permanently locked in the attic. There is the warning that radical rightwingers would also gain parliamentary representation, but the point is moot. The hard right – led by the likes of Suella Braverman – has already taken over the Tory party and is set to become even more dominant after an election defeat. Under a fairer electoral system a European-style centre-right party might do better than under the system we have now. Experts remain divided on whether the local elections point to a hung parliament, and given the combination of Tory self-immolation, squeezed living standards, high interest rates and the Scottish Nationalists’ crisis, a majority Labour government is an entirely plausible prospect. But a repeal of pernicious Tory laws – and a check on Starmerite authoritarianism – is more likely in a hung parliament. Britain is overdue a democratic revolution: both by extending the right to vote, and an electoral system that allows full and fair representation of the nation’s views. Removing the Tories is an absolute precondition for any of this to become possible. But let’s not pretend a sweeping mandate for the authoritarian factional warriors who rule Labour is the answer. If the electorate evict the Tories without entrusting either party with a majority, they’ll have made a wise decision indeed.

    <head>Devastating floods in Italy claim lives and leave thousands homeless</head>
    <body>Five people have died and thousands have been evacuated from their homes after heavy storms wreaked havoc in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, causing severe flooding and landslides. People sought refuge on the rooftops of their homes after 15 rivers broke their banks, submerging entire towns. The five deaths were confirmed by the prefect of Forlì-Cesena, Rai News reported. Among the victims were an elderly man and a couple who owned a company in the agriculture sector, according to Corriere della Sera. The body of a German woman was found on a beach in Cesenatico, a town by the Adriatic coast, but it is unclear if she was killed in the storms. Italy’s civil protection agency said on Wednesday there could be worse to come. “The rainfall is not over, it will continue for several hours,” the agency’s chief, Titti Postiglione, told SkyTG24 news. “We are facing a very, very complicated situation.” The Savio River in Cesena, central Italy, which burst its banks. Photograph: AP There has been heavy rain across Italy in recent days but the worst-affected area has been Emilia-Romagna and parts of the central Marche region, where 12 people died in floods last September. The Emilia Romagna F1 Grand Prix scheduled fothis weekend has been cancelled. In a video shared on social media, the voices of people trapped in their homes in Faenza, a city in Ravenna province, could be heard shouting for help. Massimo Isola, the mayor of Faenza, said: “We had a night that we will never forget. We’ve never known such flooding in our city, it is something unimaginable.” Enzo Lattuca, the mayor of Cesena, where citizens swam through the floods to rescue others, said: “The situation is disastrous, it’s a catastrophe, and the rain has not yet finished.” He said on Wednesday morning that the River Savio was starting to swell again. A bridge that connected Motta-Budrio with San Martino in the area of Bologna collapsed overnight. “Do not go near it,” Italy’s fire service warned. “There is a gas pipeline close by which also seems to be affected.” Five thousand people were evacuated from their homes in Ravenna. “It’s probably the worst night in the history of Romagna,” Michele de Pascale, the mayor of Ravenna, told Rai radio. “Ravenna is unrecognisable for the damage it has suffered.” Dario Nardella, the mayor of Florence, said mountain villages on the Romagna side of the Mugello valley had been cut off due to landslides. In a post on social media, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, expressed her “total closeness to the affected population”, adding that the government was closely monitoring the situation. The deputy prime minister, Antonio Tajani, said the government would “do everything to help the population hit by the flooding in Emilia-Romagna”. “From those evacuated to the agricultural companies that have lost entire harvests,” he added. “The rescue forces and volunteers are heroes. I pray for the victims and their families.” Weather-related disasters have been on the rise in Italy, a country deemed particularly vulnerable to climate change. Emilia-Romagna and parts of Marche were also affected by severe flooding in early May in which two people died. In 2022, the hottest year on record in Italy, 310 extreme weather events were registered, causing the deaths of 29 people, according to Legambiente, an environmental group. In late November, 12 people, including several children, died in a landslide on the island of Ischia. A report in 2021 by Ispra, the Italian government’s environment agency, said 7,423 municipalities (93.4% of the total) across the country were at risk of landslides, floods and coastal erosion. However, the government has done little to mitigate against the risk. Before the latest floods, Emilia-Romagna and other areas of northern Italy were blighted by a drought that dried out land, reducing its capacity to absorb water.</body>

    <head>Labour NEC to decide next Birmingham city council leader after damning report</head>
    <body>The national Labour party has announced it will appoint the next leader of the city council in Birmingham, taking the decision away from councillors, after a damning internal report said the local party was “dysfunctional” and dominated by “personality-driven factionalism”. The move would in effect oust the current leader, Ian Ward, who was re-elected as leader of the UK’s largest local authority after a contest in May last year, and his deputy, Brigid Jones. Labour’s national party asked its Campaign Improvement Board to look into the situation in Birmingham late last year and the subsequent report, seen by the Guardian, details a litany of failings. It found there were reports of misogyny and racism in the party, women and black and minority ethnic councillors were “disengaged and disempowered” and relationships with trade unions were defined by “animosity and lack of trust”. “It is clear the existing culture and processes have contributed to a dysfunctional climate,” it said. “A legacy of years of personality-driven factionalism, cultural challenges, two particularly bitter industrial disputes, a recent divisive leadership contest and changes to governance have had a detrimental impact on the mood and morale of the Labour group.” A key recommendation is that Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) and other party members from outside the region interview and appoint a new leader, deputy leader and group officers, who should now be elected annually. This arrangement would remain “until the NEC are satisfied the Birmingham Labour group can effectively run its AGM”, the report said. The announcement was met with anger by some local councillors, who told BirminghamLive it was “disgraceful behaviour from higher powers” in the party and an attempt to “burn a house down that wasn’t even on fire”. Julian Pritchard, a Green party councillor in the city, said: “There is lots wrong with our Labour-run council. A lot of this is caused by Labour’s tendency (locally and nationally) to centralise power. “So [I am] not sure a change of Birmingham Labour leader imposed by Keir Starmer from London is the right solution for the council or the city. Our city’s leaders should be elected by the people of Birmingham.” Ian Ward was re-elected as leader of Birmingham city council after a contest in May last year. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images for IAAF In response to the report, Ward insisted he still had the confidence of the local party and said that by reverting to annual leadership elections “the group risks turning inwards instead of facing the city’s challenges”. “As the leader of Birmingham city council I have led our city through the challenges of austerity and the pandemic, safeguarding frontline services, and delivering the best Commonwealth Games we have ever seen,” he said. “I have led Labour to two overwhelming election victories. I retain the confidence of the Birmingham Labour Group having recently won a leadership election and I hope to continue leading our group as we tackle the major challenges that our city faces. “We need to focus on winning the mayoral, council and general elections, and political instability from annual elections puts that all at risk.” The report also said that a large number of complaints about services such as housing repairs and waste collection suggested the council had “longstanding and persistent issues in getting the basics right”. “Service delivery is the single biggest threat to the party’s reputation in Birmingham,” it concluded. The Labour report said Birmingham was “strategically significant” for the party, and a key area of concern before the West Midlands mayoral election next year and city-wide elections in 2026. Labour won 65 of the 101 council seats in the last local elections in May 2022, but with a significantly reduced vote share that has prompted “widespread fear” the party could lose seats in 2026, the report said. A key driver behind the report was a survey of minority ethnic councillors last year, revealed by the Guardian, in which they reported a “toxic culture” designed to keep them “in their place, which is at the bottom”. A Labour party spokesperson said: “Labour will look at the recommendations in full and, where change is needed from the Labour party, we will implement that change.” A Labour source added: “It’s clear from reading [the report] that change is desperately needed. This is the biggest authority in the country, there are a multitude of issues at its core. It’s vital that it is properly ran and it delivers for the people of Birmingham.”</body>

    <head>County cricket’s long-form stories offer something IPL just can’t match</head>
    <body>Psst. This bit is between just us, please. It isn’t something I’d want to get out in public, especially not when I’m in this line of business, but I need to get it off my chest. I don’t much like the Indian Premier League. There, I said it. This, like an acceptance you will never play the Dane, is the sort of self-knowledge you acquire in middle age, but admitting it here exposes me to youthful titters on Twitter, marks me out as the sort of man who probably quite likes gardening, sighs when he settles into a chair, someone who, yes, you may well find at a county ground on a free weekday. As I type this, Gujarat Titans are playing Sunrisers Hyderabad in what is, let me check, the 62nd game of the season that’s been running for 46 days. It looks like a good one as far as they go, Shubman Gill has hit a hundred, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has taken five wickets. It is, presumably, of serious interest to however many hundreds of thousands of cricket fans live in those two cities and everyone else in India and its diaspora who follow the league closely. For many of the rest of us, though, the games in this $10bn league come and go. Related: Leicestershire offer parable for English cricket: teams should serve, not just sell | Jonathan Liew I may glance at the headlines, dip into the scorecard, maybe even watch a clip on social media while I’m putting off writing the rest of this sentence. But the truth is that I, a man who has spent the large part of the past 20 years writing about cricket, among other things, and who still makes a living doing it, couldn’t tell you who is top of the league without looking (just checked: it turns out I’ve already mentioned them). The matches pass like leaves from autumn trees. Some of it is simply because of the format of the sport. We have had 20 years of Twenty20. Looking back, how many indelible memories have they left you with? How many moments were there among them you still think or talk about now? I have a handful, almost all from international matches, the six sixes Yuvraj Singh hit off Stuart Broad, the four Carlos Brathwaite took off Ben Stokes, Misbah-ul-Haq being caught on the sweep, Kevin Pietersen taking on Dale Steyn, Chris Gayle hitting Brett Lee over the grandstand. So, same question again then, how many of them were from franchise games? This isn’t a trick. Yours could very well be longer than mine and that’s fine. But I have two. Brendon McCullum’s hundred in the very first game of the IPL and Shane Warne’s called wicket in a Big Bash match. And yet there will be, by a quick count, just under 400 more franchise T20 matches played across 10 major leagues in 2023, one-and-some for every day of the year, and that’s without including the various off-shoots, such as the Ten10, or the 6ixty, or the regular T20 fixtures between regular domestic teams. And there are more coming in 2024. Even the people being paid to play this stuff don’t think it is the best form of the sport, just the most lucrative. “Test cricket is still my favourite,” Trent Boult told Cricinfo recently, parroting one of the great player cliches of the day. How many people will remember Shubman Gill (left) made a century for Gujarat Titans in the IPL on 15 May 2023? Photograph: Ajit Solanki/AP It sometimes seems like there are only two sorts of people who want more T20 cricket: the large part of the Indian youth market and men making money off them. Even that second group doesn’t seem entirely persuaded it’s worth it. “It is a difficult one for me because Test cricket is what you grow up on as a fan and I haven’t missed the first day at Lord’s for however many years, it is still my preferred format,” the Rajasthan Royals owner, Manoj Badale, told the BBC’s Tailenders podcast the other day. “But it is not about me, it is about what the 10- to 15-year-olds in India and across the world are thinking.” And here I was thinking the 10-year-old was supposed to be the one who points out the Emperor has no clothes on. I have two boys just a little younger than that. I wouldn’t leave them in charge of picking the Sunday afternoon movie, but here we are organising an entire sport around their preferences. Badale has a degree in economics, with a distinction in disingenuous bullshit. His plan for his “preferred format” is that “we should have it at the same time every year, played between a small set of nations that can actually afford it and Lord’s becomes like a Wimbledon, an event that is in the diary”. Seems we are going to start organising the Test schedule around the IPL owners’ social calendar. The rest of the red-ball cricket around the world doesn’t reckon, whether that is Tests in Sri Lanka, New Zealand or the West Indies or all the first-class stuff that, you know, actually makes that Test match at Lord’s possible. Odd thing is, there is an opportunity in all this. You may not have noticed, but the County Championship is quietly thriving. It has become a bastion of red-ball cricket, home, at the moment, to some of the world’s best batsmen – Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Cheteshwar Pujara, Daryl Mitchell, and Jonny Bairstow – a crop of Test-match standard bowling attacks and a surfeit of interesting plotlines as players prepare for the Test season ahead. It is the place you go if you want to watch cricket with long-form stories, with blocks and leaves, proper spells and slips, a refuge for the tragically unhip. If you’re looking, you’ll find me beside the sightscreen. This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin. To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions.</body>

    <head>UBS to make $35bn in Credit Suisse takeover – but lose $17bn in rushed deal</head>
    <body>UBS is in line to make an almost $35bn (£28bn) gain after its emergency takeover of Credit Suisse – but has said it will take a $17bn hit from costs related to the rushed rescue deal. The Swiss lender has said it will make gains of $34.8bn after taking on Credit Suisse, based on an initial assessment of data until the end of last year, according to a regulatory filing. The accounting gain will be one of the biggest ever reported by a bank in a single quarter. However, UBS is also estimating it could rack up almost $4bn in costs related to litigation, regulatory matters and other liabilities after the takeover of its smaller rival. UBS is also expecting to take a $13bn hit from asset and liability adjustments in the group, meaning the takeover will cost it $17bn, and the regulatory filing said Credit Suisse faces a number of restrictions around its business until the $3.4bn deal completes. A group of Credit Suisse investors who lost bonds worth more than CHF4.5bn (£4bn) are already suing Switzerland’s financial regulator over its decision to wipe out risky bank debt as part of the government-brokered takeover deal in March. “The extent to which UBS was a reluctant partner in the deal to buy Credit Suisse has become clear,” said Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. “The Swiss bank has had to absorb a painful loss after being rushed into taking over its beleaguered rival. It is a heavy cost to bear, and has been partly put down to the lack of time it was able to complete due diligence and assess the web of problems at Credit Suisse.” Unlike a standard deal, where parties have months to do due diligence, the Credit Suisse deal was hammered out in 48 hours with UBS executives pointing out the risks they are taking integrating the business. Shares in UBS, which have been under pressure since the deal to avoid Credit Suisse facing bankruptcy, were flat in early trading in Zurich on Wednesday. Last month, worried UBS investors urged the Swiss lender to avoid sweeping job cuts and inflating executive pay as they raised concerns about the creation of a mega-bank after the emergency takeover.</body>

    <head>Women drinking beer clothed: why are rightwingers melting down over Miller Lite?</head>
    <body>As you’ve probably noticed, the word “woke” has been entirely wrung of any meaning in recent years. BlackRock and Silicon Valley Bank are “woke”, according to the right. Walt Disney is woke. Pope Francis is woke. Even the US military industrial complex is woke. The newest target? Miller Lite. Conservatives are hopping mad after discovering a two-month-old Miller Lite commercial that was released during Women’s History Month. What exactly is the problem with this ad? Well, it seems that people are taking extreme offense to the fact that that the ad humorously points out that there is a long history of misogyny in beer advertising, including Miller’s own legacy of using women in skimpy bikinis to sell lager. Fully-clothed women drinking beer? Woke! Ilana Glazer of Broad City fame stars in the commercial, which encourages people to send in sexist beer ads so Miller Lite, which is owned by Molson Coors, can turn them into fertilizer. That fertilizer is then donated to female brewers who (bear with me here) use it to grow hops for beer. The whole initiative is called the “Bad $#!T to Good $#!T” recycling campaign. To recap: what is essentially an extremely belabored poop joke has incensed conservatives who are now calling for a boycott of Miller Lite. If you’re getting a sense of déjà vu from all this, it’s because we have seemingly entered week 934 of rightwing outrage about beer. The Miller Lite debacle follows an extended backlash to Bud Light’s partnership with the trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney last month. When I say “partnership”, I mean that Bud Light sent a personalized beer can to an influencer with 10 million followers who then made a sponsored video and put it on her Instagram page. We’re not talking a giant campaign or a groundbreaking statement about trans rights – we’re talking a tiny nod to inclusivity and an attempt to broaden Bud Light’s reach among a different audience. Which, by the way, is not exactly a huge pivot for Bud Light: the brand has been running ads targeted at the LGBTQ+ community since the late 1990s. And yet there was still a massive backlash and a conservative boycott of Bud Light. While conservative boycotts generally have very little effect, the backlash from the Mulvaney campaign was intense and reportedly caused a big 21% drop in sales across US retail stores during a week in mid-April, per an analysis of Nielsen figures cited in the Wall Street Journal. People have every right to express their opinions and to boycott brands. (Unlike many conservatives, I strongly support the right to boycott.) But what happened with Bud Light – and what’s being repeated with Miller Lite – was nothing less than a targeted harassment and intimidation campaign. Outraged conservatives found the marketing executives responsible for the campaign and hounded them online. Trolls went through social media and found embarrassing photos of Alissa Heinerscheid, who oversaw the partnership between Bud Light and Mulvaney, in college in order to try to paint her as a hypocrite for saying that Bud Light needed to update its “fratty” image. Her face was splashed all over rightwing media sites. She reportedly got death threats. Both Heinerscheid and Group VP Daniel Blake, who oversaw marketing for Anheuser-Busch’s mainstream brands, were put on leaves of absence. Rather than protecting their employees and sticking by a consistent set of principles, Anheuser-Busch, which owns Bud Light, seemed to throw its executives under the bus and kowtow to the bigoted masses. “We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people,” the company’s CEO, Brendan Whitworth, said in a wishy-washy press release titled Our Responsibility To America. “We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer.” It then released a new patriotic ad pandering to conservatives. A similar harassment campaign is now being waged against Sofia Colucci, the chief marketing officer for Molson Coors. Rightwing outlets are publishing hit pieces targeting the executive and Colucci has reportedly deleted multiple social media account pages because of the harassment. Thankfully Molson Coors is reacting with a little more courage than Anheuser-Busch and refusing to pander to bigots. “People can take issue with our ads or our brands, but we won’t stand by as people personally attack our employees – especially given that these are company decisions, and are never made by one single person,” Adam Collins, Molson Coors’ chief communications and corporate affairs officer, told Newsweek on Tuesday. Which is precisely what the people at Bud Light should have said. Indeed, if Anheuser-Busch had reacted with a little more guts, then conservatives might not have felt so emboldened to start attacking executives at Molson Coors. Conservatives, it should be noted, have been getting outraged at adverts since the advent of television. You don’t have to do much to trigger the right, after all; you just have to remind them that they live in the 21st century. In 2013, for example, a Cheerios ad with an interracial family sparked online outrage from the right (yes, you read that right: 2013). Then in 2016, Old Navy was similarly accused of “anti-white propaganda” because there was an interracial family in its ads.So none of this outrage is new. What does feel new, however, are the targeted attacks on marketing executives and the coordinated attempts to get them fired. The right has a history of using online mobs to get journalists it doesn’t like fired, and now it’s using this playbook to target and censor other industries.</body>

    <head>Trump’s allies attempt to undermine prosecutors endangering his 2024 bid</head>
    <body>As Donald Trump’s legal troubles mount at the federal, state and local levels, the ex-president and his lawyers are banking on their political allies in the Republican party to make attacks on a New York prosecutor who has charged Trump with criminal offenses and to also get them to help derail investigations that endanger his 2024 campaign. Former prosecutors and members of both parties have voiced strong criticism about the drives by Trump, his lawyers and Republican House allies to attack prosecutors who have filed charges against Trump, or are investigating him, calling such moves antithetical to democratic principles and the rule of law, as well as fruitless. Related: FBI accused of failures but key report finds no deep-state plot against Trump Such criticism hasn’t deterred Trump, his lawyers or pliable Republicans from trying to discredit prosecutors with political attacks that in part reflect Trump’s lack of success in convincing courts to curb prosecutors. In April, the House judiciary committee chairman, Jim Jordan, a key Trump ally, publicly launched an inquiry into the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, soon after he filed a 34-count indictment of Trump for falsifying business records tied to alleged hush money payments that Trump made in 2016 to Stormy Daniels, the porn star who claimed Trump had an affair with her. In a Fox News interview last month, Jordan echoed Trump’s attacks on Bragg for “interfering” in the coming election charging that “Alvin Bragg used federal tax dollars to go after a former president, to indict a former president for no crime, [which] interferes with the federal election”. Donald Trump and Jim Jordan at a rally for JD Vance in Vandalia, Ohio, in November 2022. Photograph: Michael Conroy/AP The House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, too has supported Trump by calling the Bragg charges “not a real case”, after downplaying the investigation by saying the payments were just “personal money”. For his part, Trump has repeatedly launched his own feverish attacks on several prosecutors including calling Bragg, who is black, an “animal”, a “degenerate psychopath” and a “racist”. Two Trump lawyers also last month wrote to the House intelligence committee chairman, Michael Turner, blasting special counsel Jack Smith for pursuing a criminal inquiry into Trump’s retention of hundreds of classified documents at his Florida home Mar-a-Lago after he left the White House. The letter asked Turner to tell Smith to “stand down”. It came amid signs Smith’s inquiry may be in its closing stages with fresh testimony from Trump insiders and was sent to Turner even though Congress does not have the authority to control justice department (DoJ) criminal investigations. Trump’s own attacks on Smith escalated in mid-May with posts on his Truth Social platform charging Smith with “harassing, terrorizing and threatening people who work for me, probably illegally”. Separately, Trump and his lawyers have mounted harsh attacks on the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, who since early 2021 has been investigating drives by Trump and his allies to block Joe Biden’s win in Georgia including a high-pressure Trump call with the secretary of state, and is expected to file charges this summer against Trump and several others. Trump has labeled Willis, who is black, a “racist”, and his lawyers are trying to have a special grand jury report, which is mostly under seal, but reportedly recommended charges against more than a dozen people “quashed and expunged from the record”, a move Willis is challenging. Taken together, the efforts by Trump and his lawyers to ratchet up House attacks on prosecutors and investigators fuel concerns amid experts. Casting doubt on the legitimacy of investigations is another attack on democracy Barbara McQuade, former US attorney for eastern Michigan “Casting doubt on the legitimacy of investigations is another attack on democracy,” said former US attorney for eastern Michigan Barbara McQuade. “The strategy seems to be to undermine all efforts to hold Trump accountable for misconduct. The logical extension of that practice would be to allow Trump to violate the law with impunity. The rule of law demands that all of us be held to the same standard.” Other ex-prosecutors express similar criticism and stress that politicians seeking to do Trump’s bidding in this regard could be participating in a public cover-up. “The folks who Trump is enlisting to help him with a legislative fix need to be reminded of how easy it is to potentially become part of a cover-up to the American people after the fact,” said former Georgia US attorney Michael Moore. “A prosecutor can easily argue that these continued efforts to generate help are both proof of his guilt and proof that he knows he’s caught.” Moore added: “Given the status of the multiple inquiries involving Trump, I wouldn’t want to be the one getting the call to help. I’d feel like a fireman answering the alarm yet knowing I was the one likely to get burned.” Similarly, current and former House members say moves to undermine prosecutors by Trump, his lawyers and House allies are dangerous to US civic life. “All the attacks on judges, prosecutors and the courts are a thoroughgoing assault on any part of the judicial system that takes up a case related to Trump,” the House Democrat Jamie Raskin told the Guardian. “It’s an astounding violation of our proper federal role. It demonstrates the willingness to use any lever of institutional power over other parts of the government to advance Trump-related objectives.” Former Republican congressman Charlie Dent agreed. “I would never have intervened in a pending federal, state or local criminal matter. At the very least it would have felt inappropriate. The members who are attempting to shield Trump from federal, state or local investigations should stand down.” Such qualms didn’t slow Jordan from aggressively attacking Bragg’s 34-count indictment of Trump and echoing Trump’s claims that the charges were politically driven. Soon after Trump blasted the Bragg charges, Jordan issued a subpoena to Bragg which the prosecutor rejected as improper interference in a pending criminal case. Then Jordan subpoenaed a top ex-prosecutor in the DA’s office, Mark Pomerantz, who penned a book about the long-running inquiry into Trump’s hush money payments. While Pomerantz is expected to comply with the subpoena, Jordan may not be pleased with the results, say critics. Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of the fraud section at the justice department, told the Guardian that Jordan’s move to haul Pomerantz before his committee “is going to boomerang because Mark Pomerantz, as he detailed in his book, is likely to shiv Trump”.

Photograph: Charles Krupa/AP Separately, to help Trump fend off Smith’s investigation into the hundreds of classified documents he took to Mar-a-Lago, other Trump lawyers are prodding Congress to intercede and short-circuit the special counsel’s inquiry. “DoJ should be ordered to stand down, and the intelligence community should instead conduct an appropriate investigation and provide a full report to this committee, as well as your counterparts in the Senate,” the Trump lawyers wrote to Turner. The letter lamely faulted “the staff’s packing processes and not any criminal intent by President Trump”, to explain how the classified documents wound up in Mar-a-Lago. Trump, though, may have undercut his own lawyers during his CNN town hall last week when speaking of the removal of the documents, he boasted: “I had every right to do it, I didn’t make a secret of it.” Some House veterans ridicule the Trump lawyers’ missive. “I think the letter to Turner was stupid,” the former Republican congressman Tom Davis said. “Why they would do that is bonkers.” Trump’s efforts to mobilize House allies to go after the criminal investigations into his conduct set dangerous precedents and will not succeed, say critics. Related: Trump is now a legally defined sexual predator – will it affect his 2024 bid? “Not long ago, a savvy legislator would try hard to keep away from pending criminal or civil enforcement investigations, perhaps out of a sense of propriety, perhaps for fear of scandal,” the Columbia law professor and ex-prosecutor Daniel Richman said. “Maybe this is no longer true, and what otherwise would seem like naked obstruction for partisan gain or out of partisan loyalty can hide behind a claim of fighting the alleged weaponization of the federal government.” Other justice department veterans are adamant that prosecutors won’t be deterred by political pressures on them. “The attempted infusion of political influence into the work of DoJ’s career prosecutors rarely if ever benefits the target of such an investigation. It is viewed by prosecutors as an attempt to corrupt and improperly influence their investigation, and that’s a line DoJ’s prosecutors won’t cross,” said Pelletier.</body>

    <head>World likely to breach 1.5C climate threshold by 2027, scientists warn</head>
    <body>The world is almost certain to experience new record temperatures in the next five years, and temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, scientists have warned. The breaching of the crucial 1.5C threshold, which scientists have warned could have dire consequences, should be only temporary, according to research from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). However, it would represent a marked acceleration of human impacts on the global climate system, and send the world into “uncharted territory”, the UN agency warned. Countries have pledged, under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, to try to hold global temperatures to no higher than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after scientific advice that heating beyond that level would unleash a cascade of increasingly catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts. Prof Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, said: “This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C specified in the Paris agreement, which refers to long-term warming over many years. However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency.” Global average surface temperatures have never before breached the 1.5C threshold. The highest average in previous years was 1.28C above pre-industrial levels. Interactive The report, published on Wednesday, found there was a 66% likelihood of exceeding the 1.5C threshold in at least one year between 2023 and 2027. New record temperatures have been set in many areas around the world in the heatwaves of the past year, but those highs may only be the beginning, according to the report, as climate breakdown and the impact of a developing El Niño weather system combine to create heatwaves across the globe. El Niño is part of an oscillating weather system that develops in the Pacific. For the past three years, the world has been in the opposing phase, known as La Niña, which has had a dampening effect on temperature increases around the world. As La Niña ends and a new El Niño develops, there is a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years will be the hottest on record, the scientists found. Interactive Taalas warned of the effects. “A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory. This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment,” he said. “We need to be prepared.” The Arctic is heating much faster than the rest of the world, and this appears to be having an impact on global weather systems, including the jet stream, which has disrupted weather across the northern hemisphere in recent years. There is likely to be less rainfall this year in the Amazon, Central America, Australia and Indonesia, the report found. This is particularly bad news for the Amazon, where scientists have grown increasingly concerned that a vicious cycle of heating and deforestation could tip the region from rainforest into savannah-like conditions. Related: UN warns heat records could be broken as chance of El Niño rises That could have calamitous consequences for the planet, which relies on rainforests as massive carbon sinks. Over the next five years, there is likely to be above-average rainfall in northern Europe, Alaska and northern Siberia, and the Sahel, according to the report. For each year from 2023 to 2027, the global near-surface temperature is predicted to be between 1.1C and 1.8C above the pre-industrial average, taken from the years 1850 to 1900. The world has warmed considerably in recent years. In 2015, when the Paris agreement was signed, requiring countries to hold global temperature increases to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels while “pursuing efforts” to hold them to 1.5C, it was forecast that the chance of temporarily exceeding the 1.5C threshold within the following five years was zero. This November, governments will meet for the Cop28 UN climate summit, where they will assess progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. Known as the “global stocktake”, this assessment is likely to show that the world is far off track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the 43% this decade that is required to have a good chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C.</body>

    <head>Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret review – Judy Blume’s classic pre-teen tale retold</head>
    <body>Judy Blume’s proto-YA classic from 1970 gets a screen adaptation; it is a sweet-natured, undemanding, oddly inconsequential movie about a lonely, smart 12-year-old anxious about the onset of puberty and adulthood. Blume herself gets a producer credit and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo. The movie is played as a 1970 historical piece rather than being updated to the modern world, which would of course require LGBTQ+ plot additions, though I suspect a completely original drama of this sort set in 1970 would not tacitly consent, as this does, to the invisibility of gay people. Ant-Man’s Abby Rider Fortson is engaging as Margaret, who has to move from New York to New Jersey when her dad Herb (Benny Safdie) gets a big, though unspecified, job and his wife Barbara (Rachel McAdams) agrees to quit her art teaching career to be a stay-at-home mom for Margaret out there in the burbs. Margaret desperately misses her New York-based grandma – that is, her dad’s mother Sylvia, a nice performance from Kathy Bates – and there are other problems. Barbara is bored and unsatisfied (are they living in the same street as Mad Men’s Don and Betsy Draper?). Her mother’s devoutly Christian and bigoted parents objected to her marrying a Jew, which means Margaret has never met them. And then there is Margaret’s black comic embarrassment-ordeal of growing up: the boys, the training bras and the sanitary towels. But what about God, the absent character to whom Margaret occasionally addresses her concerns in private, and whose existence she never doubts for a moment? Does she get an answer? It was the ostensibly serious, religious nature of the novel that no doubt allayed the fears of school librarians and teachers back in 1970, and allowed Blume her admirable candour in addressing sexual themes; I myself kept waiting for God to “reply” with some epiphanic moment of divine revelation, the sun coming out from behind a cloud at a key point. Well, fortunately nothing so crass occurs, and that’s a relief though also perhaps an anticlimax. A sweet, eminently sensible film. • Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret is released on 19 May in UK cinemas.</body>

    <head>Qatar steps up to join bidders for next Rugby League World Cup in 2025</head>
    <body>Qatar is among four nations to have expressed an interest in staging the next Rugby League World Cup after France pulled out as hosts. The organising committee conceded on Monday that they would be unable to stage the tournament in 2025 after failing to meet financial criteria set out by the French government, leaving the event at risk of a deficit. The International Rugby League board held an emergency meeting on Wednesday to set out a strategy for seeking a replacement host, with a decision expected in July. However, the body’s chair, Troy Grant, revealed four nations have already expressed an interest in taking over from France including Qatar, which staged the men’s football World Cup last year. Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for &apos;The Guardian&apos;. If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version. In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications. Turn on sport notifications. New Zealand, South Africa and Fiji have also stepped forward but Grant stressed that no option is off the table, including the prospect of delaying to 2026 or even cancelling altogether and planning for the 2029 tournament. “We’ll be guiding each expression of interest to our committee and all those and any options will be presented, and proper due diligence will be done,” Grant said. “But the reality is the size of the tournament will have a bearing on what we do. Related: 2025 Rugby League World Cup in doubt after France pull out of staging event “There’s potential to move it out of this cycle and create a new cycle … everything is on the table. Everything is a possibility at this stage. All options are on the table as we understand that time is running out and we need to move quickly.” Qatar has ramped up its interest in major sporting events and organisations in recent years. The Arab nation’s hosting of last year’s Fifa World Cup attracted global attention, while the Qatari billionaire, Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, has this week made an improved offer to purchase Manchester United. Elsewhere in football, Paris Saint-Germain, through its shareholding organisation Qatar Sports Investment, is a subsidiary of the Qatari state-owned sovereign wealth fund. The gulf state will also host next year’s under-19s Asian Cup, as well as the 2030 Asian Games. But a Qatar bid to bring rugby league to the middle east would be arguably its most interesting move yet. Grant was hesitant to discuss too much about Qatar’s preliminary expression of interest, though he did concede that the high temperatures around October and November, when the tournament would likely take place, could be a factor in any decision-making process. “I haven’t looked at the temperatures there,” he said. “But ours would be slightly earlier than the football so seasonal conditions would be tough, I’d imagine. They’re the kind of factors we need to consider. We’ve no due diligence to give any expression of interest their due course of credit. We haven’t made any assessment in regards to the viability of them.” Last year’s Rugby League World Cup in England saw the men’s, women’s and wheelchair tournaments run alongside each other to great acclaim. The plan had been for France to do the same but with a youth tournament included too. Grant admitted that if the World Cup is still held in 2025, that multi-tournament format will be difficult to replicate given the tight timescales involved in effectively repackaging and rebuilding an event in a different country within a little over two years. Australia’s James Tedesco holds aloft the trophy as they celebrate winning the men’s World Cup in Manchester in November last year. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images/Reuters “The uniqueness of three World Cups being run at the same time was something that drew record investment,” he said. “We’re the only sport that’s conducted our World Cup format like that and it stood us aside from other sports. It’s a massive selling point, so to abandon that strategy would be disappointing: but we have to be practical in any decisions we make going forward.”</body>

    <head>First Thing: Quad summit cancelled after Joe Biden calls off trip to Australia</head>
    <body>Good morning. Anthony Albanese has confirmed the Sydney Quad meeting will not go ahead, after the US president, Joe Biden, pulled out of his Australian visit to deal with domestic issues. Early this morning Albanese was still hopeful the meeting with the leaders of India and Japan could proceed with a senior representative from the US, but hours later he confirmed the event was off. Instead, the Quad nations are expected to have a sideline meeting at the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend, with all four leaders still attending. Biden has cancelled a planned visit to Australia and Papua New Guinea to focus on debt limit talks as Washington stares into the abyss of a potentially catastrophic default. The move came as the president hosted a fresh round of talks with congressional leaders at the White House in an effort to break the deadlock – and faced criticism from his left flank over rumored concessions to Republicans. When will the trip be rescheduled for? It is not known when Biden will be able to reschedule his Australia trip. The postponement, due to hostile negotiations with the Republican-heavy US Congress over the government’s debt ceiling, comes at a delicate time in the US’s engagement with the Pacific region. The visit was supposed to help cement the US’s renewed interest in the Indo-Pacific and help quell regional concerns over the Aukus agreement. North Carolina bans abortion at 12 weeks, overriding Democratic governor’s veto State representative Tricia Cotham switched parties last month, giving Republicans a supermajority in the house, much to North Carolina abortion rights advocates’ ire. Photograph: Jonathan Drake/Reuters North Carolina has passed legislation banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy after the state’s Republican-controlled general assembly successfully overrode the Democratic governor’s veto yesterday evening. The house completed the second and final part of the override with a vote of 72-48. The move is expected to deal a fresh blow to one of the last bastions of abortion access in the south, which has been significantly curtailed after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, had honored a vow he made to North Carolinians to protect reproductive rights by vetoing SB 20 during a public rally in Raleigh on Saturday, which was attended by thousands. But in separate votes yesterday, the state senate and house cleared the path to put new restrictions into place. Cooper condemned the decision to override his veto and move forward with the ban, and said he would do “everything I can to protect abortion access in North Carolina because women’s lives depend on it”. What does the legislation say? Last week, Republicans had rushed the bill through the house, drawing criticism from other legislators and abortion rights advocates. The 46-page bill, in addition to banning abortion after 12 weeks, extends the waiting period for people seeking abortions to 72 hours, requires providers to send sensitive information to the state department of health and human services, and requires clinics to obtain special licensing that would result in clinic closures throughout the state. Court rules Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes must go to prison while she appeals against sentence Holmes had asked the 9th US circuit court of appeals to pause her sentence. Photograph: Jeff Chiu/AP The Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes must begin serving her prison sentence while she appeals against her conviction on charges of defrauding investors in her failed blood-testing startup and must jointly pay $452m in restitution to the victims of her crimes, a court in San Francisco has ruled. Holmes, who rose to fame after claiming Theranos’s small machines could run an array of diagnostic tests with just a few drops of blood, was convicted at a trial in San Jose, California, in 2022 and sentenced to 11 years and three months in prison. She had asked the ninth US circuit court of appeals to pause her sentence on 25 April, two days before she was to report to prison. The court denied her bail application yesterday. The judge will set a new date for Holmes, 39, to leave her home in the San Diego area and report to prison. In a separate ruling, Judge Edward Davila held Holmes jointly liable for the restitution payments and ordered her to pay the $452m with her former lover and top Theranos lieutenant, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. Is Balwani in prison? Yes, he began a nearly 13-year prison sentence in April after being convicted on 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy last July. He was put in a southern California prison last month after losing a similar effort to remain free on bail while appealing against his conviction.

Photograph: Syed Mahabubul Kader/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock Global plastic pollution could be slashed by 80% by 2040, according to a report from the UN Environment Programme (Unep). The changes needed were major, but were also practical and affordable, the agency said. The first step was to eliminate unnecessary plastics, such as excessive packaging, the report said. Then next steps were to increase the reuse of plastics, such as refillable bottles, boost recycling and replace plastics with greener alternatives. Such a shift, driven by government policies and changes in the plastic industry, would mean plastic pollution would drop to about 40m tons in 2040, rather than 227m tons if no action were taken. The changes would bring benefits worth trillions of dollars between now and 2040, the report said, by reducing the damage caused by plastics to health, the climate and the environment.

Considering medication is the most common US abortion method, it is the most significant reproductive rights case to make its way through the courts since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. The groups suing the Food and Drug Administration over its approval of the drug claim that the drug poses a threat to women and girls – contrary to scientific consensus – and should never have been approved by the FDA more than two decades ago. The FDA vehemently stands by its approval of the pill, with the Biden administration emphasizing the agency’s rigorous safety reviews of the drug.

But for women who take advantage of sundress season, the much-anticipated warm weather can also bring unwanted attention. Not that it should. There is little evidence that harassment or assault is motivated by what a victim wears, and clothing is never a justification for cat-calling. Still, anyone who does not want to risk it may use the subway shirt, which is also known colloquially as an “outfit dampener”. Everyone has a subway shirt in their closet: a baggy, shapeless cover-up meant to divert eyeballs away from the body. “It’s an oversized shirt we wear over cute outfits so strange men don’t bother you on the train,” one creator wrote on TikTok. “Just know if you see me in a white button down, the real fit is underneath,” another woman commented. Climate check: Cop28 host UAE’s approach is ‘dangerous’, says UN’s former climate chief Christiana Figueres was pivotal to the delivery of the Paris climate agreement in 2015. Photograph: Jeffrey Arguedas/EPA The United Arab Emirates’ approach to the Cop28 climate summit it will preside over in November is “very dangerous” and a “direct threat to the survival of vulnerable nations”, according to the UN’s former climate chief. Christiana Figueres, who was pivotal to the delivery of the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015, also said the country holding the presidency of the UN summit could not put forward its own position and had to be neutral. The UAE is a big oil and gas producer, and the designated president of the Cop28 summit is Sultan Al Jaber, who is also the head of the UAE’s national oil and gas company, Adnoc. Figueres was responding to a speech by Al Jaber in which he said: “We must be laser focused on phasing out fossil fuel emissions, while phasing up viable, affordable zero-carbon alternatives.” That was widely interpreted to mean using carbon capture and storage technology to capture CO2 emissions, and not completely phasing out fossil fuels themselves.

    <head>Turkey’s first multi-party elections – archive, 1946</head>
    <body>Editorial: Turkish politics 20 May 1946 The rulers of Turkey have always paid lip-service to Kemal [Atatürk]’s idea of “continuous evolution” towards democracy. At a special congress on 10 May the Republican People’s party, which has been in power since 1923, took positive steps to loosen the political structure of the country in time for the elections, which are technically due next spring. It announced the introduction of direct voting and the cancellation of restrictions which prevent the formulation of parties on a class or professional basis. Continue reading. Quiet election in Turkey 22 July 1946 Istanbul, 21 July Turkey’s first democratic general election to-day passed off quietly. The new National Assembly, chosen by universal suffrage and secret ballot for the first time, will include an opposition to the Republican People’s Party, hitherto the only authorised party. It is certain that the Republican People’s Party, which was formed by Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, will secure a strong majority, but the five opposition parties are expected to win 125 to 150 seats out of a total of 465. The Democrat party, the strongest opposition party, contested 46 of Turkey’s 63 provinces with a list of 272 candidates. In the remaining 17 provinces the Republican People’s Party was not challenged. The main support for the Democrat party is in the trading towns of the Black Sea and Aegean Sea coasts, which want greater economic freedom and more liberal institutions to promote prosperity. The full results will not be known until Wednesday. The sale of alcoholic drinks was prohibited during the polling. Related: Turkish president demands purge of religion from politics - archive, 1924 Editorial: As we were 26 July 1946 The Turkish Republican People’s Party has emerged from the ordeal of a general election with its forces in good order and more or less intact. Not that the ordeal was in any way severe: the government’s radio forecast the result (and its own big majority) with considerable accuracy, and, the prevailing note in all its pre-election broadcasts was the success of the new direct ballot system rather than its results. For this success it was only necessary for the Turkish people to do their duty, and President İnönü and his followers made sure that they knew where their duty lay. Of the five opposition parties only one, Mr Celâl Bayar’s Democrat party, achieved any success, and they have already threatened to resign their 64 seats on the grounds that the elections were rigged. The venerable Marshal Çakmak gained a seat as an independent in Istanbul. Of the National Regeneration party, the Social Democrats, the Liberal Democrats, and the Peasants’ and Workers’ party, little has been said. It may be that some of them, if they were strong enough, might form a more convincing opposition than Mr Bayar’s party. As it is, there is only one home and foreign policy in Turkey, and that is the government’s. The government was determined to carry it out, but felt the need to answer its critics at home and abroad. The elections have provided it with an answer.</body>

    <head>Ofgem orders three energy firms to pay £8m compensation over late bills</head>
    <body>Three energy suppliers have been made to pay compensation totalling £8m for failing to supply a final bill on time to more than 100,000 households that had switched provider. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, said E.ON Next was ordered to pay £5.5m to almost 95,000 customers because it did not provide them with a final bill within six weeks of moving to another supplier, nor did it pay compensation for the delay within 10 days of the missed deadline. Octopus Energy was made to pay approximately £750,000 to 19,000 customers, while almost 350 Good Energy customers received a combined total of £18,000. The three suppliers also paid an additional £1.7m fine towards a redress scheme that supports vulnerable consumers, of which E.ON Next paid £1.3m. This is the first time that the regulator has used its powers to crack down on companies that fail to provide a final bill on time since the requirement was introduced in 2020. A delayed final bill can mean that a customer is incorrectly set up at their new supplier or receives a large, unexpected bill from the previous provider. Under Ofgem’s rules, customers must receive a final bill within six weeks of leaving a supplier or become entitled to compensation of £30. If this is not provided within a further 10 working days, a customer is due an additional payment of £30. Ofgem expects that more customers will switch suppliers in the months ahead as falling energy market prices allow energy firms to cut their tariff rates to compete for customers. Neil Kenward, the regulator’s director for strategy, said: “Our rules mean that where energy companies drag their heels, customers are automatically compensated. We won’t hesitate to hold energy companies to account, as we have done today.” An E.ON spokesperson said it told Ofgem last year that the supplier’s own internal checks had uncovered that its system was not aligned with the regulator’s rules, meaning compensation payment for final bills were sent out after the stipulated six-week timeframe. “At the time, we contacted affected customers to apologise and sent them their missing payments,” the spokesperson said. “We have since taken steps to ensure this error does not happen again.” Octopus and Good Energy declined to comment.</body>

    <head>Inter’s Champions League progress built on depth and defensive resilience</head>
    <body>The semi-final known to Italians as il Euroderby began with an ear-splitting chorus of “Pioli’s on fire” one week ago at San Siro, Milan supporters showing appreciation for their manager, Stefano, but it ended as vindication for the man in the opposing dugout. Simone Inzaghi was supposed to be a dead man walking in early April, national newspapers predicting that one more defeat could lead to his sacking at Internazionale. At which point he simply stopped losing. Eight wins in a row have carried the Nerazzurri from sixth to third in Serie A, and into a pair of cup finals. Defending the Coppa Italia is one thing, fighting for the Champions League another. Few outsiders gave Inter hope of even reaching the knockout phase of this competition when they were drawn with Bayern Munich and Barcelona in the group stage. Related: ‘Anything can happen’: Inter’s Inzaghi urges belief in Champions League final Yet that is what they did, beating the Catalan side at home and drawing 3-3 at the Camp Nou before eliminating Porto, Benfica and now their neighbours Milan. Inzaghi insisted on Tuesday that none of this was a surprise to him, telling Sky Sports: “I believed. I believed from the day of the draw.” It takes more than self-confidence to reach a European final. On Tuesday, Inter won by suffocating any lingering hope out of a Milan side they had beaten 2-0 in the first leg. The Rossoneri mustered only a single shot on target before Lautaro Martínez struck in the 74th minute to put this tie to bed. This was the fifth meeting of the season between these teams, and the fourth in a row that has ended with an Inter clean sheet. Would it be oversimplifying things to trace that statistic back to one player? Would it seem ridiculous if the footballer in question was a 35-year-old centre-back who had played a grand total of 10 Champions League games before this season, playing on loan with an option to buy for €4m? Francesco Acerbi’s neutralisation of Olivier Giroud has been one of the more quietly fascinating subplots of this season in Italy. The Frenchman’s two goals in a derby in February last year changed everything, turning a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 victory that set Milan on a path to winning the Scudetto off their neighbours. Francesco Acerbi wins an aerial battle against Olivier Giroud during a commanding display in the second leg. Photograph: Alessio Morgese/NurPhoto/Shutterstock Giroud scored again as Milan beat Inter at the start of this campaign, with a newly arrived Acerbi watching from the bench. Since then, the defender has been assigned to mark him in all four derbies, and the striker has not had a sniff. Inter were champions of Italy when Inzaghi succeeded Antonio Conte in 2021 but the process of dismantling a title-winning side was already under way. The club’s owners, Suning, needed to cut costs after years of heavy losses, raising more than €200m (£174m) in that first summer from the sales of Romelu Lukaku, Achraf Hakimi and Matteo Politano. Less than a quarter was reinvested in the squad. Inzaghi accepted the situation without complaint, not lamenting a lack of transfer spend, but Acerbi was one player he lobbied for. They worked together for three years at Lazio, and the manager recognised what he still had to offer as a player and a leader: someone who has survived testicular cancer and overcome a messy relationship with alcohol that threatened to derail him early in his career. It was Acerbi who laid out the significance of this derby most bluntly before the second leg, saying that “if we lose this becomes a shit season. Very little separates a great season from a failure”. Inter took the path towards glory on Tuesday, and while they will certainly be underdogs against either Manchester City or Real Madrid in the final, neither Inzaghi nor his players believe they are going to Istanbul to make up the numbers. “We are in the final of the Champions League on merit,” said Robin Gosens. “When you are in the final of the Champions League you step out on to the pitch to win.” This Inter team might not have an Erling Haaland or Karim Benzema, but they are hardly average Joes. Martínez is a World Cup winner whom Inzaghi has backed to one day challenge for the Ballon d’Or. Nicolò Barella is the most well-rounded midfielder Italy has produced in a generation. Hakan Çalhanoglu is on a mission to prove his stated belief that he is one of the best five playmaking midfielders in the world. Their depth has been essential. Where Ismaël Bennacer’s injury in the first leg of this semi-final was a hammer blow to Milan, Inter could lose Henrikh Mkhitaryan on Tuesday and call on Marcelo Brozovic, a medalist at the past two World Cups, off the bench. Lukaku, back at the club on loan, has collected five goals and three assists in his past four league games but Inzaghi had the luxury of deploying him here as an impact sub in relief of Edin Dzeko. Federico Dimarco salutes the Curva Nord. The wing-back attended Inter’s previous Champions League semi against Milan, in 2003. Photograph: Daniela Porcelli/SPP/Shutterstock Then there is the defence that has conceded only three times in this eight-game winning streak. An all-Italian back three of Acerbi, Alessandro Bastoni and Matteo Darmian has impressed but Inzaghi’s greatest coaching triumph at Inter has perhaps been Federico Dimarco, the 25-year-old wing-back who graduated from the club’s academy but who had spent most of his career bouncing between short-term moves to other clubs – Ascoli, Empoli, Sion, Parma and Verona. Dimarco, who set up Mkhitaryan’s goal in the first leg, has the joint-most assists of any player in this season’s Champions League, level on five with Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior. He grew up an Inter fan and was present at San Siro when they lost to Milan the last time these teams met in a Champions League semi-final, in 2003. After the final whistle went on Tuesday, he grabbed a microphone and led supporters in a chant of “we’re all off to Istanbul”. In the Curva Nord a banner was raised, taunting Milan with the message “Pioli’s on ferie”. No longer on fire, but off on his holidays instead.</body>

    <head>Ann Widdecombe: don’t have cheese sandwiches if you can’t afford them</head>
    <body>Families should go without cheese sandwiches if they cannot afford the ingredients, Ann Widdecombe has said. The former Brexit party MEP said there was no “given right” for low food prices, despite being told families “cannot afford to feed their children” and were having to make huge sacrifices as the cost of living crisis deepens. Widdecombe, who joined the Reform UK party this year, was on BBC’s Politics Live programme when she was asked what she would say to consumers who could not afford to pay for basics such as the ingredients of a cheese sandwich. “Well then you don’t do the cheese sandwich,” Widdecombe replied. “None of it’s new. We’ve been through this before. The problem is we’ve been decades now without inflation, we’ve come to regard it as some kind of given right.” The government has been urged to intervene in the deepening crisis as research has found some meat and vegetable items at supermarkets have almost doubled in price over the past year. According to the consumer group Which?, annual inflation on supermarket own-label budget items rose to 25% in April. Before Widdecombe made the comments on Politics Live, she had heard of BBC research that showed the cost of a homemade cheese sandwich had risen by a third to 40p a serving. She claimed farmers had “constantly” complained to her about supermarket pricing when she was the MP for Maidstone. “The only way this is going to be tackled is if inflation is going to come down,” Widdecombe said. “You will not get inflation coming down if you continue to have inflationary wage rises.” The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney, said: “How out of touch can you get? Ann Widdecombe joins a long line of rightwing politicians who pin the blame on hard-working families for this government’s failures. “Families are struggling to afford the weekly shop, but Rishi Sunak is refusing to act. We need a proper plan to bring food prices down now including tackling profiteering and boosting support for our farmers.” As the Conservatives’ devastating local election losses set in, one of Sunak’s ministers admitted the party had to improve its response to the cost of living crisis. Johnny Mercer, the MP for Plymouth Moor View, said after Labour took control of the local council: “We’ve got to do better and we’ve got to learn from tonight.” The culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, also said the Tories’ losses of more than 1,000 local councillors reflected concerns among voters about the high cost of living. “It’s really important that we listen to people,” Frazer told Sky News. “I know people are frustrated and angry.”</body>

    <head>Norway under pressure to scale back fossil fuel expansion plans</head>
    <body>The Norwegian government is facing growing pressure to scale back its huge global fossil fuel expansion plans – including the development of a controversial new oilfield in the North Sea. Climate activists from around the world descended on Stavanger in Norway last week to attend the AGM of the state-owned oil and gas giant Equinor. They warned that its plans to develop the huge Rosebank field in the North Sea, as well as other mega-projects in Canada, Brazil and Suriname, would drive climate breakdown with devastating consequences for humanity. “You have been warned that we cannot have any new oil and gas fields if we are to have a shot at limiting the absolute worst of climate breakdown,” Lauren MacDonald, 22, from Scotland, told the Equinor board during a speech at the AGM. “[But] you continue to expand fossil fuel operations despite desperate warnings from climate scientists and are spending next to nothing on the transition that is our only hope of survival.” Climate campaigners accuse the Norwegian government, which owns 67% of Equinor, of hypocrisy. They argue that at the same time as portraying itself as a climate leader on the world stage, the Norwegian state is ploughing ahead with new oil and gas developments around the world. Recent analysis by Oil Change International found Norway is Europe’s “most aggressive” explorer of new oil and gas fields, awarding 700 new exploration licences in the past decade as well as Equinor’s specific plans. In addition, it found the oil and gas within fields that are already licensed but not yet developed could lead to an additional 3 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions – 60 times Norway’s annual domestic emissions. Frode Pleym, the head of Greenpeace Norway, said: “Norway is rightly praised for its success of its electric vehicles, it was one of the first countries to ratify the Paris accords but at the same time it is planning to lock in oil and gas production for decades to come – not just for Norway but, because of the scale of its involvement, for the whole of Europe. It is taking climate hypocrisy to a whole new level and it has to stop.” The Rosebank project is one of Equinor’s most controversial schemes and is facing widespread opposition in the UK. A massive North Sea development, three times bigger than the Cambo field that was put on hold more than a year ago, it has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil, which when burned would emit as much carbon dioxide as running 56 coal-fired power stations for a year. Last month it was revealed that Rosebank would effectively blow the UK’s carbon budget in the next decade, as greenhouse gas emissions from its operations alone – not counting emissions from any oil produced – would exceed the guideline amounts for the oil and gas sector.

Photograph: Carina Johansen/NTB Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images The campaign group Uplift has also calculated that Equinor could receive an estimated £3.75bn of tax breaks and tax-funded incentives towards the estimated £4.1bn cost of the development, owing to loopholes in the government’s windfall tax on North Sea fossil fuels. About 80% of the fossil fuels produced by Rosebank are likely to be exploited, and the development could turn into a net loss of £100m to the UK taxpayer. A spokesperson for Equinor denied it was in line for any tax breaks or that UK taxpayers would lose out. They added: “Oil and gas will be needed in the decades ahead. As long as there is a need for oil and gas, we think it is important that we continue to invest in fields that can contribute to energy security with a low carbon footprint, while creating jobs and value for society.” The International Energy Agency warned before the UK-hosted Cop26 climate summit in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration should take place if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. This year, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called on governments to halt new licences for oil and gas exploration and development. A decision on whether Rosebank can go ahead is believed to be imminent, and the UK government could stop it, though the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, has said repeatedly the decision is not up to him. Opponents of the project are working with climate activists from Norway, Brazil, Canada and Argentina to try to stop Equinor’s wider expansion plans. Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, said the Norwegian government was under increasing pressure to act. “Norway claims to be a climate leader, but there is no way that it can show its face in the next round of climate talks while its state-backed energy firm is bent on massive oil and gas expansion … Norway can and must force Equinor to align its plans with the climate science and massively ramp up its transition to clean power, it must side with those countries that are already experiencing the climate crisis, that are demanding action now because they are running out of time.” Earlier this year, the Norwegian government passed a white paper saying all state-owned companies should set targets and implement measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement. At the AGM, campaigners from Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature put forward a similar motion. The motion failed, with the Norwegian government voting against it – although it did add a statement to the minutes saying it expected “the board and administration to work actively with the state’s expectations” in relation to climate change. Ragnhild Elisabeth Waagaard, the head of the climate and energy team at World Wide Fund for Nature Norway, said the Norwegian government’s statement was a positive step and had increased the pressure on Equinor’s board of directors. “We now expect the company to set targets and take measures to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. This means that there is no room for new development of oil and gas fields”. In a statement, Halvard Ingebrigtsen, the secretary of state at Norway’s ministry of trade, industry and fisheries, said: “In the new white paper on the state’s direct ownership, the government states that our goal as an owner is the highest possible return over time in a sustainable manner. We also state that this requires the companies to balance economic, social and environmental factors. “Norway is the first country to expect companies with state ownership to have short- and long-term climate targets in line with the Paris agreement, which implies net zero emissions by 2050.”</body>

    <head>Ed Sheeran beats second lawsuit over Thinking Out Loud and Let’s Get It On</head>
    <body>Ed Sheeran has defeated a second lawsuit that alleged he imitated Marvin Gaye’s Let’s Get It On for his song Thinking Out Loud, two weeks after he prevailed in another high-profile copyright case regarding the two songs. A district judge in Manhattan, Louis Stanton, dismissed the case that had been brought against Sheeran by Structured Asset Sales (SAS), a company owned by an investment banker David Pullman. Pullman essentially owns a portion of Let’s Get It On, namely part of the song’s copyright originally belonging to Ed Townsend, who wrote the song with Gaye in 1973. SAS had alleged “the combination of the chord progression and the harmonic rhythm used in Thinking Out Loud is substantially similar to that in Let’s Get It On, and thus infringes the work”. But the judgment against SAS found that the chord progression that Sheeran was alleged to have copied for Thinking Out Loud wasn’t unique enough to merit a copyright claim. “That is especially true here where the chord progression and the harmonic rhythm (how the chord progression is played) in Let’s Get It On do not form a pattern, but instead essentially merge into one element,” the judgment reads. SAS’s case specifically alleged copyright infringement against the sheet music of Let’s Get It On. Sheeran faces another pending lawsuit from SAS, related to the finished recorded version of Let’s Get It On, which Pullman hopes will reach a jury trial. Sheeran’s earlier victory, in a case that did reach a trial, was brought by Townsend’s heirs who also share in the copyright to Let’s Get It On. Again, the chord progression was not found to be unique enough to warrant a copyright claim, and Sheeran prevailed. Related: New Ed Sheeran album, Subtract, informed by ‘fear, depression and anxiety’ During the trial, he had threatened to quit music if he lost the case, saying: “I find it really insulting to devote my whole life to being a performer and a songwriter and have someone diminish it.” After winning, he said: “I am obviously very happy with the outcome of the case and it looks like I am not having to retire from my day job after all. But at the same time I’m unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all.” Sheeran is currently top of the UK album chart with his new album –, or Subtract, which was the fastest-selling album of the year so far.</body>

    <head>WNBA power lies with two superteams. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing</head>
    <body>Over the course of its 27 year history, the WNBA has come to be defined by dynastic superteams and fierce rivalries. It dates back to the league’s humble beginnings in the late 1990s, when the now-defunct Houston Comets won the first four WNBA finals, defeating the New York Liberty in three of them. The Minnesota Lynx were next, appearing in six finals between 2011 and 2017, winning four titles. But those teams were built in very particular ways. The Comets became the WNBA’s first dynasty because the league distributed players to each team ahead of its inaugural season and had no idea how good four-time WNBA finals MVP Cynthia Cooper would be. Whereas the Lynx were built primarily through the draft, being fortunate enough to select Maya Moore and Seimone Augustus No 1 overall, and later trading for Sylvia Fowles. The WNBA’s new superteam era is fundamentally different, because the rising tides in Las Vegas and New York were not born out of the league’s mistakes or chance in the draft, but through free agency. A new collective bargaining agreement ratified in 2020 gave players the freedom to choose their destinations for the first time in league history. It came to a head this winter when two of the greatest players of all time headed for opposite sides of the US for two of the league’s biggest markets, with Candace Parker joining the reigning champion Las Vegas Aces and Breanna Stewart going to the New York Liberty. As a result of an unprecedented level of player movement, the WNBA’s next era is going to look fundamentally different. But it could also be a whole lot better for everyone involved. “I’m a big rivalry [person],” Parker said after a recent Aces practice. “You think about the foundation of every single thing and every single person that tunes into anything: college basketball has UConn and Tennessee, right? Put it on the map … You think about the NBA with the Celtics and the Lakers and their rivalry, right? And I think in order to [succeed], you need those types of rivalries.” The Aces signed two-time MVP Parker this offseason after running away with the 2022 WNBA championship behind an MVP season from center A’ja Wilson. Parker will join a star-studded starting five of Wilson, finals MVP Chelsea Gray, MVP-finalist Kelsey Plum, and All-Star starter Jackie Young, giving them four former No 1 overall draft picks and four MVP trophies. There have been hiccups though: this week the team were docked a 2025 first-round draft pick and head coach Becky Hammon was given a two-game ban for “impermissible player benefits and Respect in the Workplace policies”. Related: South Carolina’s Aliyah Boston: ‘Every time we step on that floor, everybody wants to beat us’ Meanwhile, after selecting star guard Sabrina Ionescu first overall in 2020 and losing in the first round of the playoffs in each of the past two seasons, the Liberty have joined the Aces as the clear betting favorites to win the 2023 WNBA championship after remaking their starting five. The Liberty traded for center Jonquel Jones before signing last year’s scoring leader and MVP runner-up, Stewart, adding two former MVPs. Courtney Vandersloot, the league’s active all-time assists leader and a former overseas teammate of Jones and Stewart, joined the picture too. The WNBA was already seeing immense growth without any high-profile superteams or rivalries, with the 2022 WNBA season being the most viewed since 2006. Meanwhile, the WNBA is in the process of making games more accessible to viewers, signing a new TV deal with Scripps to televise Friday night games this season. And women’s basketball is growing, with this year’s women’s NCAA Tournament having its highest viewership ever, with the title game between Iowa and LSU drawing 9.9 million viewers. But sports leagues are top-down structures. As much as the WNBA was growing organically, it needed a push to reach its full potential. After all, fans are often drawn by the biggest markets and best teams and go from there. In fact, it’s not a stretch to say that the rivalry between Larry Bird’s Boston Celtics and Magic Johnson’s Los Angeles Lakers saved the NBA in the 1980s. While the four-year stretch between 2015-18 when LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers and Steph Curry’s Golden State Warriors met in the NBA finals featured the highest NBA viewership of any span since Michael Jordan’s run in the late 1990s. The WNBA has all the momentum in the world right now, and its new superteam era should bring in more casual fans. “We’re trying to elevate the level,” Liberty head coach Sandy Brondello said. “We’re trying to promote our game and create those rivalries. I think that’s great for the WNBA. Hopefully more fans can come and watch us, and we’re selling it... We think we got some pretty special players, but you know Vegas got some special players [too].” “I think that’s what it was going to make us work really hard and get up in the morning,” Liberty co-owner Clara Wu Tsai added. “Is to be able to beat that team in the West.” But superteams don’t only help bring in casual fans to a league that has struggled with attendance and needs extra revenue if it is going to expand beyond 12 teams by its stated goal of 2025 – they also help elevate the standard of play. And there is no better proof of this than the fact that both Parker and Stewart are the MVP-caliber players they are today because they were inspired by past superteams. “I would say watching the Houston Comets play [inspired me] for sure,” Gray recently told the Guardian. “It was a first of its kind, and you’re always looking to see the first one to do something … we were watching it, kind of aspiring to be in that position.” “Yeah, I raised the roof for sure,” Parker added, referring to Comet’s guard Cynthia Cooper’s famous celebration. “And I definitely tried to go out and shoot like Tina Thompson. You know, shoot a runner and Euro [step] like Cynthia Cooper.” Stewart was busy winning four straight national championships at the University of Connecticut during the height of the Lynx and Los Angeles Sparks rivalry, saying: “It was intense. That’s what I think of. And especially the players on both teams, the way that they had so much talent and they were able to play well together, I think that that’s what I remember about those two … When you’re a basketball player, you want to play with other great players.” But players like Parker and Stewart never really had the opportunity to be “surrounded by greatness,” as Stewart put it, until now. By limiting the amount of times a franchise can “core” a player and lock them up from as many as four one-year periods down to just two with the new CBA, the WNBA has empowered players to make their own decisions. “I think what you’re seeing is the player empowerment era, if you want to call it that, where players are getting to choose the location of their legacy, and I think that’s really important,” Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said. Stewart is the vice president of the WNBA Players Association and has used her platform to push the league forward. “I think that as far as player movement, it’s something that the league needs,” Stewart said during Liberty media day. “And you’re gonna see it happening a lot more and that means just player movement, fan engagement is going to go from one team to another team. It’s just gonna make it more exciting, make things more spicy,” Stewart added, admitting that she used emojis on Twitter to create a buzz around her own free agency, helping the WNBA become a 12-month a year league like the NBA. “But it’s what the league needs to continue to kind of grow the way that we want it to and the way that it should.” Despite being at different stages of their careers, 37-year-old Parker and 28-year-old Stewart made their free agency moves for ostensibly the same reasons: In addition to having familial ties to the regions and wanting to play with other great players – both taking pay cuts to do so – Parker and Stewart were tired of sacrificing their own desires and well-being for the betterment of the league. It was time to prioritize themselves, and specifically their health and their bodies. In fact, Parker and Stewart both spoke about their desire to maximize the rest of their careers and to be treated well by franchises with ownership groups that have shown a willingness to go above and beyond for their players. So they each left smaller markets for the richest ownership groups and biggest markets in the league. Given the WNBA’s historically lackluster treatment of athletes, it makes sense. Parker has never had her own locker in her 15 year career. She came into the league during a time when teams had to work around NBA schedules and switch facilities constantly, and she has never had the ability to get up shots at a dedicated practice facility whenever she wanted to because it was always shared with other teams. Plus, like most WNBA players, she has also had to play overseas to supplement her salary until a recent media gig with Turner Sports has kept her in the States. And, again, we are talking about one of the greatest players of all time. We got you, @Candace_Parker. [ 🎥 @Money23Green, @TheVolumeSports ] pic.twitter.com/iy0dd3Pyzx — Las Vegas Aces (@LVAces) April 28, 2023 “That’s just a part of the grind. That’s a part of growing it,” Parker said about her past experiences in Los Angeles and Chicago. “But at the end of the day, I think the reason why I’m here is because I feel like we deserve this at some point.” Parker joins an Aces team with a brand new, 64,000 square foot, state-of-the-art practice facility – the first of its kind in the WNBA. It’s complete with a weight room, training room, hydro tread, infrared sauna, nutrition bar, a hyperbaric chamber that Parker has already napped in, and a hot and cold tub she uses every day. The Aces are owned by Mark Davis (who also owns the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders and is worth a reported $2bn) and Tom Brady. They play at the Michelob Ultra Arena, a 12,000-seat arena on the Las Vegas Strip, where they had average crowds of 5,607 last season and will have seven nationally televised games in 2023. “I think it factored into my decision a lot,” Parker told the Guardian about ownership’s willingness to spend money and treat players right. “I think as a 37-year-old player, as a vet, taking care of my body is first and foremost. So to be able to have access to not just a locker but a facility that you can go and rehab and have the latest machines ... that can help my body be as prepared as it can be going into year 16.” Stewart still plays overseas each offseason because that is where she makes the majority of her salary. She does so despite what happened with former overseas teammate Brittney Griner, who was detained in a Russian prison for 10 months after bringing hashish oil into the country. Griner’s ordeal has forced other WNBA players to reconcile with their decisions to play overseas and to push the WNBA for a more livable salary. Considering that Stewart plays basketball year-round and returned to the United States just days before the start of Liberty training camp, her body and health were top of her mind when making a decision to leave the Seattle Storm for the Liberty this offseason. Like the Aces, the Liberty have invested in their facilities in recent years. The team’s owners, Joe and Clara Tsai, are estimated to be worth over $8bn, significantly more than any other WNBA team owners. That has allowed them to move the team to the Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn, a 17,732 capacity arena that they own and that is also home to the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets. There the Liberty have created their own modern practice facility. They have also heavily invested in their performance team in order to improve their athletes’ mental health and wellness, as well as recovery. “I think one of the most neglected areas in this league for a long time is player health,” Kolb said. “Especially when you have players going overseas, they’re coming back, we have a camp, and they’re all in various states of condition… We want to have the best performance team period. And that’s what we’re committed to doing because that’s what these players deserve.” Stewart told the Guardian that those investments were “very important” in her free agency decision. Adding: “They want to make sure that this team is getting everything that they need. And you realize that the moment that you walk in: You walk in, there’s breakfast, and then there’s treatment, and then there’s the weight room, and then there’s the court, and there’s all these people around who are trying to help you. “The WNBA should have teams that have a one-stop shop. I shouldn’t have to travel all over the place to get everything I need. And here in New York, you can get that right here. So, to be able to come in and have that is amazing because what I just touched on before is: I want to be my best and I want to be able to do everything I can to get that and that means the resources, and here we have all the resources.” What has become clear during the 2023 offseason is that the best players in the world are tired of sacrificing their bodies and well-being for the betterment of the league, and that it is the WNBA’s turn to meet them where they deserve to be met. The hope is that Parker and Stewart’s decisions will reverberate throughout the league and accelerate growth, pressuring the other 10 ownership groups to invest in similar resources so that the biggest markets don’t always have a competitive advantage, and so that the standard of the entire league is elevated. “Pressure might be a strong word. I’m sure everybody’s aware, at least on some level, of what everybody’s doing,” vice president of basketball operations and assistant general manager of the Dallas Wings, Travis Charles, said over the phone. “...I think new things like a practice facility and all of that stuff, I think will be the norm sooner than later. “I believe the majority of the teams were heading in the direction of enhanced player care regardless of whether it was forced by the CBA or not. I think just time and commitment and the new wave of owners has vowed to do things specifically here for our players that we weren’t able to before … So I think it might hasten or quicken what was already going to happen.” After all, the WNBA is still relatively young, with practice facilities, bigger arenas, expansion, and charter flights the most likely next dominoes to fall as the league continues to grow and improve. “I hope that this has inspired others to kind of step up the game because I know that’s how it is with ownership: It’s a competition,” Parker said. “So now, who’s going to be next?”</body>

    <head>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker at 20 – this under-appreciated Zelda game is also one of the best</head>
    <body>When people ask what my favourite video game of all time is and I tell them, they inevitably wrinkle their nose and say: “What, the one with all the sailing?” To many, that’s all The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is: a 20-year-old GameCube release in which toon Link endlessly sails the vast sea on his trusty talking boat. In 2013, when the game was re-released on Wii U a decade after its debut, Nintendo took the criticisms on board (the talking boat) and added a “swift sail”, allowing players to bypass hours of sluggish seafaring. For shame. The seafaring was the point. It has now been two decades since the original Wind Waker was released in Europe in May 2003 and it’s time that landlubber critics accepted they were wrong. The game’s expansive ocean was not only soundtracked stunningly, but filled with endless side quests and mini-games, emphasising exploration in a way not seen again in a Zelda game until 2017’s Breath of the Wild. As an 11-year-old girl clicking the little gold disc into place inside her (sister’s) first GameCube, I realised just how engrossing video game worlds can be. ‘I realised just how engrossing video game worlds can be’ Photograph: Nintendo The story begins on Link’s birthday, the very best place for any story to start. A plucky, pleasant musical theme welcomes you to his home island, but the music – and his destiny – changes forever when Link’s little sister Aryll is kidnapped by a big bird whom you later discover was sent by your evil archenemy Ganon. Pirates, dragons, and the discovery of a sunken Hyrule follow. I’ve completed Wind Waker about seven times and picked it up to play here and there many, many more times than that. I fondly recall school holidays plonked in front of my fat little telly in my bedroom, the game filling an empty summer that stretched farther ahead of me than any animated ocean ever could. I paused only to eat and drink – but I was so desperate to return to the sea that I fortuitously discovered that you don’t actually have to bake flapjacks. It’s far better to take the bowl to your bedroom and eat the raw mixture with a wooden spoon. As I’d only played Ocarina of Time before this point (badly, as my enduring fear of Skulltulas lasted longer than my time with the game), I was unaware of the controversy that surrounded Wind Waker prior to its release. Forums were flooded with hate after a demo was played at Nintendo’s 2001’s Space World trade show. Long-time Zelda fans lamented the “childish” cel-shaded art style and even Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto “cringed” on first seeing early footage. “It ticks me off that they have to make it so kiddy,” complained one gamer on an “Official Zelda Bitch Thread” hosted on IGN’s forums. Another user simply said: “I think I’m going to cry.” Specialist Nintendo publication NGC Magazine made a (then topical) Anne Robinson gag: “You are the strangest Link. Hello!” Two decades later, this once-maligned art style has proved timeless, meaning the game has aged far better than its contemporaries. You can play it today and not feel its age; I should know, because I do. Last September, frustrated by Nintendo’s seeming unwillingness to re-release the game on Switch, I frivolously spent £70 on an adapter that would allow me to plug my (sister’s) GameCube into my modern telly without resulting in a load of fuzz. Timeless … fighting a boss. Photograph: Nintendo It makes me feel slightly unserious to not praise Wind Waker’s dungeons, puzzles, and fluid fighting, but truthfully it’s the game’s side quests that I’ve always been enamoured with. For me, no other Zelda game has really lived up to it in that regard. I mean: a school teacher asks you to collect 20 necklaces for her and in exchange she gives you a deed to your very own island cabana! Inside your private oasis, there are multiple sliding picture puzzles via which you can win almost 1,000 rupees! Elsewhere, you can sort letters, collect feathers, and set up two young people on a date by taking two well-timed photographs. You can play a game of battleships with a bored-looking shop owner who shouts the words “SPLOOSH” and “KA-BOOM”! There’s an entire morality tale about a rich man and a poor man swapping places and within this, there is one of the greatest bits of Zelda meta humour. “Do you think you can just break someone’s vases and leave without paying for them?” the rich man asks, when you do what Link does best and enter someone’s dwelling uninvited before smashing up their pots. You’re forced to pay 10 rupees for each broken vase. Thanks to the art style, the characters in Wind Waker are almost all unforgettable. We meet Zelda as a punchy, un-princess-y pirate named Tetra. She loves to wink. Meanwhile, Link’s stooped and soup-making grandmother reminds me so much of my own that it moves me to interact with her. And then there’s a kid named Zill that my siblings and I have only ever known as “snotty kid” thanks to the huge glob of mucus that hangs from his nose. Of course, the game had its fair share of heart-pumping moments too. Zombie-like ReDeads paralyse you, let out a bone-chilling scream and then chomp on your head. When you slash at a big friendly pig on your home island, its snout turns red and it chases you around town until it murders you. I’ve rarely felt adrenaline like it. Wonderfully expressive … toon Link. Photograph: Nintendo Wind Waker began life as an underestimated underdog, but multiple publications named it game of the year after its release. Twenty years on, no one would dare criticise its graphics (even if people still grumble about the slow sailing). “I feel like we did a really great job of creating an animated world that you can live in, that you can explore,” Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said a decade after the game’s release. Once Shigeru Miyamoto stopped cringing, he too praised the impact of Wind Waker’s bold new direction: “It’s when you’re really able to do something revolutionary within a medi[um] that’s existed for some time that I think you’re able to shock and startle people.” Wind Waker may have shocked and startled initially, but it is pure comfort to me today. Early armchair critics may have condemned it as “kiddy” – but I was a kid, and I (mostly) fondly recall introducing the game to other kids (it was only mildly frustrating when the younger girl my mum looked after once a week refused to do anything other than cut grass). Today, the game is just as delightful as ever. When I click the top left button on my GameCube and am greeted by the blazing sun and crisp blue sea of Wind Waker’s title screen, I can confidently say that the only thing that has aged is me.</body>

    <head>The arts in Britain are teetering on the brink. Here is my plan to save them</head>
    <body>The great conductor Simon Rattle hit a nerve when he talked about the recent cuts to the “flesh of our culture”. Three years after the pandemic started, audiences might be back, but confidence that the arts can withstand waning government support isn’t, and classical music isn’t alone in feeling beleaguered. When I became director of the National Theatre in 2003, things could not have been more different. Government investment was flowing into the arts and the Arts Council had the resources to fund a renaissance in regional theatre. Between 1997 and 2007 arts spending doubled; dance, opera and classical music all flourished. The optimism and financial security that made the first years of my stint at the National so fruitful now seem like a distant memory. Today, I don’t know a single subsidised arts organisation in the country that feels financially secure. Many freelance artists have given up, battered by the pandemic and the disastrous removal of their right to work freely in the EU. During the pandemic, the unexpected generosity of the government’s £1.6bn Culture Recovery Fund prevented a collapse of the entire sector. But I despair at the bizarre decision to invest heavily in a fund to help the arts outlive Covid, only to starve them of the support they need to return to health. An admirable commitment to boost spending outside of London as part of the levelling-up agenda turned out to be a textbook example of levelling down. In February 2022, the then culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, instructed the Arts Council to take £24m from London and distribute it elsewhere in England: nowhere near enough to transform the picture in the rest of the country, but enough to devastate English National Opera, and many others. The Arts Council was established to distribute state funding at arm’s length without government interference, so you might have expected it to resist the government’s assault on its independence. Maybe it tried, but the suspicion is that the Dorries agenda dovetailed neatly with its own. In its latest strategy document, the Arts Council laid out plans for England to be a country “in which the creativity of each of us is valued and given the chance to flourish. A country where every one of us has access to a remarkable range of high-quality cultural experiences.” Nobody could argue with either of these ambitions. The problem is that “the creativity of each of us” must these days be nurtured without the help of schools from which the arts have been ruthlessly stripped. Even more of the Arts Council’s reduced resources must be ploughed into papering over the cracks of an education system that has turned its back on music, drama and the visual arts. And that’s even before it addresses the goal of unlimited adult creativity. This vast remit is in addition to what used to be the Arts Council’s sole purpose, but now comes second: the support of what it coyly calls “high-quality cultural experiences”. In other words: funding and giving access to the work of writers, composers, actors, musicians and dancers who have trained and devoted their professional lives to making art. There isn’t enough money to do any of it, so it’s no surprise that my colleagues have given up on trying to make their case with the current government and are looking to what will presumably be the next one. In their approach, I hope they will be bold. After 13 years under attack, it’s too easy to adopt the cringe of a whipped dog. Even the great Simon Rattle, though he was on the warpath, felt he had to “understand this is a time of belt-tightening”. The total Arts Council England grant is £458.5m: less than 0.05% of all government spending. Even doubling it would make barely a dent in the national finances. But a significant increase would be transformational out of proportion to the relatively modest sums involved: on the confidence and productivity of artists, the size and enthusiasm of audiences, the wellbeing of communities,our town and city centres and our international reputation. But funding is only part of the problem for an Arts Council that is being pulled in several different directions. Maybe the way forward is for the arts to use sport as a model. There are two distinct funding bodies for sport. UK Sport has, in its own words, “a very clear remit at the ‘top end’ of Britain’s sporting pathway, with no direct involvement in community or school sport”. And it wins us medals. The other, Sport England (which has equivalents in the other home nations) invests in sport and physical activity to make it a normal part of life for everyone and gets us out on the track at the weekend. Both functions are vital. My proposal, then, for a Labour government, is to fund, in addition to the Arts Council, a new body as expert in its field as Sport England. In doing so, recognise the importance of participation in the arts with its own funding stream, to which new community-based initiatives as well as established education and outreach programmes can apply. And re-establish the arts in schools. Meanwhile, focus the Arts Council’s existing grant on making the best possible art by professional artists for the most diverse possible audience. There is more than enough talent and more than enough enthusiasm to rebuild the creative powerhouse that has been so battered by the last 13 years.

    <head>MP questions referendum wording – as it happened</head>
    <body>9.22am BST What we learned; Wednesday 17 May That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today – thanks so much for joining us. Here is a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said in a speech today that the full ambition of Aukus will only be realised if the transfer of technology and information between Australia and the US is “seamless”. Wages increased at annual rate of 3.7% in the March quarter, topping expectations. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has revealed the Quad meeting will not be going ahead after US President Joe Biden’s withdrawal. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, is still expected to come to Australia this year. Anthony Albanese criticised Liberal MP Stuart Robert’s no-show at parliament as “completely unacceptable”. Some of the injured children involved in yesterday’s collision between a school bus and a truck will have to undergo amputations. The truck driver was charged earlier today. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, was at the National Press Club and rejected suggestions the opposition rhetoric on migrants had emboldened fascists. The former Liberal shadow attorney general Julian Leeser said the voice referendum wording was “a stumbling block” for some to vote yes. Sydney recorded a new low in rental listings, with the number of new listings falling 17% month-on-month in April on realestate.com.au – the lowest it has been in a decade. The Falls festival will not ring in 2024, with organisers announcing the national New Year’s event will take a year off to recalibrate. The AFL has decided against a twilight grand final, confirming the 2023 decider will be held at the traditional time of 2.30pm AEST on 30 September at the MCG. The Miles Franklin long-list was announced, and included 11 Australian novelists. Updated at 9.27am BST 9.10am BST Mark Latham likely to have to defend controversial tweet insulting Alex Greenwich in court AAP is reporting that the controversial NSW One Nation MP Mark Latham is set to defend a graphic and homophobic tweet in court as his window to apologise closes. The One Nation state leader was widely condemned from across the political spectrum after posting the tweet directed at openly gay Sydney MP Alex Greenwich last month. Greenwich earlier this month said the tweet was “extremely defamatory” and he was prepared to sue Latham if the One Nation MP did not apologise, retract the comment and commit not to make similar statements again. A deadline for Latham to apologise for the tweet passed at 5pm on Wednesday, and it is expected a claim will be filed in the federal court in the coming days. Updated at 9.13am BST 9.02am BST Victorian minister for equality hosts drag storytime event in Parliament House The Victorian minister for equality, Harriet Shing, hosted a drag storytime at the state’s Parliament House today, attended by the premier, Dan Andrews, Labor MP Vicki Ward and families. In the past six months, at least 11 queer events across the state have been cancelled. Shing said it was important to remember increasing intimidation from members of far-right groups was not enough to stop every council around Victoria from raising a rainbow flag: Nor could it stop us from hosting a drag queen storytime event right here in Parliament. I was so proud to be joined by so many colleagues, rainbow families, allies, and members of our LGBTQI+ communities. It was a colourful, fun and inclusive celebration of LGBTQI+ visibility, and sent a really strong and positive message that LGBTQI+ safety, connection and pride have never been more important than now. The Victorian Government is hosting a drag story time event at parliament today to mark IDAHOBIT day. It also announced $1.8M for Rainbow Health Australia to deliver inclusion training to make sure organisations are safe for the LGBTIQ+ community #springst pic.twitter.com/Ov8pHZnwqY — Bridget Rollason (@bridgerollo) May 17, 2023 After successfully protecting a drag storytime outside Eltham library today, a group of LGBTQ+ defenders, the Rainbow Community Angels, have promised to protect future queer events. The group’s co-founder, Felicity Marlowe: It’s been fantastic ... But we’d really like a world where we didn’t need to be there. People should really be able to leave work and study and go to the local library. Whether you’re a young kid, a rainbow family [or] an older trans person. These are our beautiful public institutions. We are sick of the systemic discrimination and vilification. Our families and children are under and it’s got to stop. Co-founder of the Rainbow Angels Felicity Marlowe has promised the group will be at more events in the future after they successfully stopped protestors from cancelling today&apos;s drag storytime in Eltham. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/kDo6FfhSC9 — Cait Kelly (@cait__kelly) May 17, 2023 Updated at 9.08am BST 8.46am BST Maribyrnong city council declares pollution health emergency A “health emergency” has been declared by a Melbourne council, which claims residents are suffering above-average rates of hospitalisations for certain conditions partly due to a surge in road trains on its suburban streets. Maribyrnong city council, which takes in Footscray in the city’s inner western suburbs, announced the declaration on Wednesday, claiming rates of illness in the municipality due to pollution “considerably exceed the Australian average”. “Council believes this is in part due to the exhaust from heavy trucks, which contains particulate matter, being blown directly into resident’s homes day in and day out from morning to night,” it said in a statement. The health emergency declaration follows long-term frustration about heavy trucks driving through suburban streets around Footscray, even after a curfew was introduced in 2015. Adolescent asthma rates in the City of Maribyrnong are 50% higher than the state average, and the hospital admission rate is 70% higher than the Australian average for those aged between three and 19.

Outgoing boss Gillon McLachlan said the time of the grand final would continue to be reviewed to “deliver the best possible game experience, both for fans at the ground and for the millions watching the broadcast”. The incoming chief executive, Andrew Dill, had indicated his support for a day grand final. There had been speculation this year’s grand final could move to a twilight slot of around 4pm but fans and senior AFL figures kept their support behind a day final. In 2020 Covid restrictions forced the grand final to move to an evening time slot at the Gabba in Brisbane, and then a twilight time slot in 2021 at Perth’s Optus Stadium. Last year’s fixture between Geelong and Sydney was held in the afternoon in front of more than 100,000 people at the MCG. Proponents of a later grand final start time argue the potential TV ratings spike is worth breaking tradition for. The AFL is also expected to announce its support for a yes vote on the Indigenous voice to parliament in the coming days. Updated at 8.54am BST 8.12am BST PM cautions accepting Coalition ‘scare campaign’ rhetoric on migration levels The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, also took aim “a low-rent attempt by the Coalition” to whip up a scare campaign about migration, during his interview with ABC Radio Brisbane this afternoon. Albanese was asked what his plan was for housing for arriving migrants. Albanese cautioned the interviewer, Steve Austin, not to accept the Coalition’s rhetoric on the topic: It’s important to not be sucked into a scare campaign about what the migration levels are. Albanese pointed to pandemic-related factors when explaining the budget projections for net overseas migration. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and his senior Coalition colleagues have focused on migration in the wake of the budget. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, said on Monday that “this budget does add 1.5 million immigrants … most importantly without a plan”. But the budget doesn’t set this as a target or a policy as such – it outlines forecasts for “net overseas migration”. Net overseas migration is forecast to be 400,000 in 2022-23, followed by 315,000 the next year and 260,000 in each of the following three years. The Coalition has added these together to come up with the “1.5 million immigrants” figure. Updated at 8.16am BST 7.54am BST PM confirms Indian leader Narendra Modi will still visit Australia despite Quad meeting cancellation The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has confirmed that the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will still visit Australia for a bilateral meeting next week, despite the cancellation of the Sydney Quad leaders’ summit after Joe Biden pulled out. During an interview with ABC Radio Brisbane this afternoon, Albanese confirmed that Modi would meet with Albanese and also hold business meetings and make an address at Homebush in Sydney: I look forward to welcoming him to Sydney. He made me a very welcome guest in March and he is the host of the G20 this year. As for the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, Albanese said a bilateral program wasn’t planned in Australia. He said Kishida had visited Perth late last year, and Albanese would attend the G7 summit hosted by Kishida this weekend. Albanese reiterated that there were now plans “for the four Quad leaders indeed to have discussions when we are at Hiroshima at the G7 meeting”. Updated at 8.05am BST 7.36am BST Light plane crashes at Melbourne Essendon airport AAP is reporting that a light plane has crashed onto its roof at Melbourne’s Essendon airport. Television footage from the scene shows the small plane lying on its roof on the grass with firefighters nearby. Nine emergency vehicles responded to the crash, which was reported at 4pm. Paramedics were called to the incident but were not treating any patients, an Ambulance Victoria spokesperson said. Fire crews are working to isolate any potential fuel leak before the scene can be declared safe. Emergency services at the scene of a plane crash at Essendon Airport in Melbourne, Wednesday. Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP Updated at 8.43am BST 7.29am BST Julian Leeser: voice referendum wording ‘a stumbling block’ for some to vote yes The former Liberal shadow attorney general Julian Leeser has said that the wording of the voice referendum question is a “stumbling block” for some Australians to vote yes. Leeser was on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, and addressed reports that the yes vote had been declining in support, reflected in some recent polls, and said the referendum was in “real difficulty”: I think referenda always start out or tend to start out with high support for the yes case and as time goes on, and people hear the campaign, and doubts are created, the support is whittled away. Unfortunately, the legislation has not even been settled and yet we are already in a position where the referendum is in real difficulty. I still think there is a lot of goodwill in the community for it. But … I have been critical of the government’s handling of this: not releasing detail, not answering some of the questions that Peter Dutton put in early January, I think, has been problematic for the success of this. You cannot change the past but we can change the future. And that is what I’m focused on. I’m not arguing here about the legal technicalities. I am arguing that these words that are in the referendum are a stumbling block for some Australians to vote yes, I want to remove the stumbling block and encourage more Australians to vote yes to the referendum. Updated at 7.36am BST 7.23am BST Queensland cabinet reshuffle predicted tomorrow Queensland’s environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, will be promoted to housing minister in a cabinet reshuffle aimed to revitalise three critical portfolios ahead of next year’s state election. Senior government sources told Guardian Australia that Scanlon will replace Leeanne Enoch as housing minister. Scanlon has been the state member for Gaven since 2017 and has been described as a rising star in the Labor caucus. Health and youth justice will also be targeted in the cabinet shake-up, with reports the state’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, will swap portfolios with the attorney general, Shannon Fentiman. Guardian Australia understands no backbenchers will be promoted, with further announcements on the cabinet changes expected tomorrow. Updated at 7.26am BST 7.09am BST At least 11 queer events called off in last six months after right-wing action Drag performer Spencer Street is performing at the online Storytime is for Everyone event. The performer revealed they had an event cancelled leading up to Idahobit day - making it at least 11 queer events that have been called off in the past six months. Street said continuing to hold events, even virtually, sent an important message to the community. There are about nine different drag artists that are a part of it. We’re just going to come out and look fabulous. We’ve all got a little competition going, who’s got the best backgrounds. And just having fun with it, because at the end of the day, we need a little bit of fun, a bit of love. Over 500 people are registered to attend the event. Updated at 7.15am BST 6.53am BST Richard Marles calls for ‘seamless’ transfer of technology and information between Australia and US Sticking with American relations, the defence minister, Richard Marles, has told the American Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide of the importance of Australia’s alliance with the United States. Marles was giving a keynote speech to the chamber and said the Aukus alliance must also cut red tape around arms and technology exports. He said the regulations around transfers of information, technology and defence material were understandable, but it was necessary to change them to “help us hold potential adversaries’ forces at risk at a greater distance and increase the cost of aggression against Australia”. What is really clear is that if we are to realise the ambition of Aukus, the transfer of technology and information between Australia and the US needs to be seamless. Marles went on to advocate for changes to the culture at the Australian Defence Force, saying it needed to embrace failure as part of developing an “innovative mindset”: Defence no longer has the luxury of taking the time to get a capability perfect. We must also change our relationship to risk and celebrate the learning that comes from failure. Updated at 7.07am BST 6.29am BST Bob Carr warns of Biden’s ‘cognitive decline’ and against Australia acting like American ‘client-state’ The former foreign minister Bob Carr has taken to Twitter to warn of the “frailty and cognitive decline” of the US president, Joe Biden, adding that attendance at major forums and conferences have been left to the “unsteady hand of the vice-president, [Kamala] Harris.” Carr, who is also a former premier of NSW, also said that the Republican base was “loyal to Trump” and to “any heir of Trump”. Prepare for Biden’s next term when frailty and cognitive decline may prevent president’s attendances at any forums leaving things to the unsteady hand of Harris. Republican base is loyal to Trump and beyond 2024 partial to any heir of Trump: — Bob Carr (@bobjcarr) May 17, 2023 Trumpian instincts are unfriendly to NATO and fond of Putin. — Bob Carr (@bobjcarr) May 17, 2023 It comes after the US president informed the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, that the Quad meeting was cancelled because Biden had to be back in the US to negotiate Congress’s debt ceiling deadlock. Carr also told the Australian newspaper that Australia needed to rethink its relationship with the United States and that policy makers needed to “factor in a serious uncertainty about projected American behaviour”: Australia is suffering from being too compliant, too un-pushy, too like a client state. Biden won’t come here, and apparently flicks off our prime minister’s submission about Assange. We were encouraged by the White House to talk-up the Quad and invest it with more substance that it has. It hasn’t even delivered on its promise for an Asian vaccine. Act like a client state, get treated like one. We’ve got out of the habit of fruitful arguments with our coalition partner. Updated at 6.42am BST 6.15am BST Thanks Natasha, Mostafa Rachwani with you to take you through the rest of the day’s news. 6.09am BST Thanks for following along today, that’s it from me this hump day. See you back here tomorrow morning! 6.04am BST Anthony Albanese colouring in rabbits – in pictures You might have noticed the PM’s press conferences are pretty regularly coming from different childcare centres around the country. That’s because these visits are part of a tour spruiking his subsidies to help more women get back into the workforce. This morning’s press conference came from Goodstart in Tweed Heads. If you were wondering how Anthony Albanese helped ease the blow of the US president, Jo Biden, cancelling his big visit down under and then the whole Sydney Quad leaders’ meeting falling to pieces as a result … the answer is some colouring in. I do not have confirmation whether Albanese brought along the Rabbitohs print offs himself or whether the centre provided the PM the opportunity to colour his favourite team’s emblem.

The ABC is reporting that the beach steps at Loch Ard Gorge have been closed to the public following a rock fall at a cliff which overlooks the stairs. A crack was discovered in the cliff face following the rock fall, just three kilometres north-west of the famous Twelve Apostles. Parks Victoria has engaged specialists to assess the geotechnical risk at the site.

Vanessa Muradian bought her new baby, along with a group of friends. She said it was more important than ever to come out and show support for queer families: I think more than ever there seems to be a rise of transphobia particularly, but queerphobia in general. In my adulthood, it felt we were coming to a beautiful place in the community. I think post-Covid a lot of hate is rising. I’m raising a baby in a queer family, it’s important she feels love in the world. Now more than ever we need love. When the hate is there we need to stand up against it. The event at Eltham is wrapping up, with families being escorted out by marshals. The angels are calling it a massive success and promising to be at more queer events. pic.twitter.com/vLaSQgSUUa — Cait Kelly (@cait__kelly) May 17, 2023 Related: Victorian councils to hold emergency meeting on far-right targeting of drag queen storytime events Updated at 5.33am BST 5.20am BST Campo finished the press conference confirming students attended school today: We’re just taking it really easy today and surrounding our kids with love and support. … there’s some children still being cared for and others having a school-approved pyjama day. Updated at 5.22am BST 5.16am BST Campo: It is just distressing knowing what our kids have been through and I can only just imagine their fear in being confronted with that scene. As I said, myself and assistant principal and our staff wrapped our arms around the kids. I know that we’re not supposed to hug kids but that is what they needed. 5.14am BST Principal says staff only expected to find a ‘minor collision’ Campo confirms that she was one of the staff members who were first on the scene. She thought she was heading to the scene of a “minor collision.” She did not expect what they found: A community member gave us a call to say the bus had been in an accident and we were about to start a staff meeting and I said I had to go and they all followed me down. We just flooded the kids. I didn’t know what I was going to see. I honestly thought I would just be there comforting some distressed kids who’d been in a minor collision. Didn’t ever expect to see that and I hope I never see that again. Updated at 5.19am BST 5.10am BST Campo thanks the bystanders who stopped to help, the emergency services, police, the department of education and the local community for providing support. To our amazing local community, we have been inundated with messages of love and support and food and flowers. 5.09am BST Exford primary school principal thanks staff for assistance in wake of Melbourne bus crash Campo acknowledges the school staff: I just want to actually acknowledge our amazing staff. Almost the entirety of our teaching staff, some were here managing the situation at school in terms of family calls. The majority were down at the site with us and that was really confronting. We were expecting a fender bender, not anything more than that. Our staff just extensively wrapped their arms around the kids and provided love and support and comfort in a really difficult situation. Updated at 5.14am BST 5.07am BST Lisa Campo, the principal of Exford primary school, follows Superintendent Cruse. I want to start by sending all the children and families are a love and our support and our thoughts are with them. I have been in contact with as many as I could reach and I will be ringing them all again later on. Updated at 5.13am BST 5.04am BST Cruse said police have just had a meeting with the parents of some of the children in the school as well as the staff that were there. It is unimaginable to imagine that children were in their classrooms and such a short time later so seriously injured so close to school. And for teachers have turned out, that is going to be really impactful for them. 5.01am BST Asked about what is known about seatbelts, Cruse says: I know the bus was fitted with seatbelts but I am unaware of the children that were or were not wearing seatbelts. 4.59am BST Cruse says as the investigation continues, it is likely there will be more charges. 4.59am BST Police say emergency response time to Melbourne bus collision ‘quite quick’ Cruse says “when I heard the job, your heart really sinks. It is really confronting.” He says the response time from emergency services’ response was “quite quick” in his opinion. We got down there. They were able to stabilise the bus and then start to remove the children from the bus and triage. It is a difficult environment to work in. The intersection is surrounded by paddocks. We had to set up just temporary triage areas. Those who are most seriously injured were conveyed to hospital really quickly. Updated at 5.02am BST 4.55am BST Police looking at ‘inattention’ as part of investigation into Melbourne bus crash As we mentioned earlier, the driver of the truck – a 49-year-old man – has been charged with dangerous driving causing serious injuries. Cruse says there are multiple counts in regards to the charge and he will front the Melbourne magistrates court later today. Asked about the possible factors around those charges, Cruse says: Inattention is something that we are actively looking at as part of the investigation. Updated at 4.59am BST 4.52am BST Cruse said many of the first responders would have known people involved in the collision: Some of the teachers went down to the scene and assisted in triaging the children before they went to hospital. 4.50am BST Police provide details on ‘horrific’ and ‘chaotic’ scene of Melbourne bus crash Cruse is providing some more details about what he described as a horrific and chaotic scene after the collision: The bus driver, despite being injured, I understand that he helped some of the children out of the bus. Then we had passers-by who have heroically stopped immediately and assisted in assisting the children who could be removed from the bus. Then we obviously had the emergency service response, some of the children were trapped and it was a horrific scene. It was chaotic. It would have been very confronting for those passers-by. I think a special mention to those people. Some of the people who also assisted up from the school here. Updated at 4.53am BST 4.48am BST Superintendent Cruse says police will allege the collision was avoidable. Updated at 5.48am BST 4.48am BST Cruse is reminding the community about road safety messaging: We want all road users to remain vigilant, concentrate, obey the speed limits, be really courteous to other road users, and stay completely in attention at all times, not use their mobile phone to make sure we do not see any incidences of this nature. 4.46am BST Superintendent Michael Cruse is describing the incident which he says has given children on the school bus “life changing injuries.” [The school bus] has been struck from behind by the by the truck. That collision has caused the bus to flip onto its side and enter the intersection with Murphy’s Lane. As a result of that collision several children in the in the bus have received life changing injuries. 4.43am BST Seven children confirmed seriously injured in Melbourne bus crash Victoria police have revised the number of children seriously injured in the bus crash to seven. Police are now addressing the media about the incident – we’ll bring you those updates.

It of course comes as Taylor and members of the opposition have criticised increased rates of immigration, with the shadow treasurer repeating often this afternoon the number of migrants expected to arrive in the coming years. But when asked about emboldening fascists, Taylor rejected the association: I just reject neo-Nazism, I can’t reject it strongly enough, and I think Peter Dutton has been very clear about that. And any association of our agenda with that, I think, is just wrong. … Look, we want the right thing for all Australians. We don’t take responsibility for the behaviour of nutters in Melbourne. I mean, if they’re going to go and do that sort of stuff, we can’t take responsibility for their heinous behaviour and we certainly don’t condone it. But we will argue the case for what’s right for Australia every day of the week, and, of course, that’s what we’re doing here.

Anti-queer protestors have signs like “kids should be protected” and are yelling at people entering the area. Frock Hudson, aka Dean Arcuri, was here earlier reading to a group of children outside the library while “angels” stood in a big circle. We spoke to him just before. He said he started crying when he rocked up seeing the big community turnout: It was beautiful to come and see all these community members and families who want to support storytime. Seeing that, I started crying straight away. Honestly it’s a really beautiful thing to see. I couldn’t be prouder of the community. This is the scene at Eltham library right now where anti-LGBT protestors are being drowned out by tunes and bangers on the other side of the road. pic.twitter.com/5xs7nIMvMM — Cait Kelly (@cait__kelly) May 17, 2023 Updated at 4.20am BST 4.05am BST Truck driver charged A truck driver has been charged after the vehicle he was driving allegedly crashed into a school bus in Melbourne’s west on Tuesday, seriously injuring 10 children. Police on Wednesday interviewed and charged the truck driver, a 49-year-old Balliang man, with four counts of dangerous driving causing serious injury after he spent the night in police custody.

Now, the budget has the Australian population growing by substantially more than Adelaide over the next five years, but with no plan to address housing supply, infrastructure needs, and other services required to make that growth successful. We all support … a well-planned migration program, and that’s the history of Coalition governments. But over five years, net overseas migration will see our population increase by over 1.5 million people. It’s the biggest migration surge in our country’s history and it’s occurring amidst a housing and rental crisis. Migration is an enormous part of our history and it’s been critical to our economic success, our culture, our lifestyles, and who we are … whilst migration will continue to serve us well into the future, it only works if you have a complementary plan around the infrastructure, the housing, and the services that are required. Instead, the government is cutting infrastructure spending in real terms and reallocating it to their pet projects. As Guardian Australia has previously reported, the picture when it comes to immigration is a bit more complicated, with Australia still catching up to pre-pandemic levels.

A string of universities including ANU, UNSW, the University of Wollongong, Swinburne and Curtin University have pledged public support for the Voice this year, with others remaining in negotiation over their institutional positions. CDU’s decision was made by the university’s council and has been backed by deputy vice-chancellor professor Reuben Bolt. It is imperative that the university ‘of’ and ‘for’ the Northern Territory, publicly endorses and supports First Nations advancement in Australia. It is critical, because the Territory has a strong history of advocacy for First Nations advancement, including the Larrakia petitions, the Barunga Statement, the Yirrkala Bark Petition, and the Walk off at Wave Hill. Advocate for the Uluru Statement from the Heart and author Thomas Mayo signed the university’s statement on Monday. The decision for CDU to unequivocally support the Yes campaign is very welcome, especially with its expertise, knowledge and connection to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their understanding of the challenges we face here in the Northern Territory. Support for the Yes vote is an acknowledgement that the best outcomes for First Nations Australians is when they are involved in the design and implementation of policy and legislation that affects them. 3.56am BST Leeser says amendments to voice will limit arguments made by no campaign But Leeser, the former spokesperson for Indigenous Australians who quit the shadow cabinet to campaign for the voice, said he was concerned about the polling. He said in a statement: Today’s Resolve Poll confirms a trend, the electoral prospects for the Voice are not tracking as they should. The best way to improve the prospects is to limit the arguments of the No case. That’s why I will be moving two amendments to the Voice constitutional alteration when Parliament returns next week. Leeser is continuing to push his so-called “Press Club model”, which he outlined at (you guessed it) the National Press Club earlier this year. His idea would remove entirely the second section of the proposed constitutional alteration, which explicitly gives the voice power to make representations to executive government – which has been a key criticism of No campaigners. Leeser said the voice needed to advise the executive, but believed it would be better to set up that power through legislation, not the constitution. I am a supporter of the Voice, I will be voting YES at the referendum, the amendments I am proposing will improve the electoral prospects of the Voice. Updated at 4.05am BST 3.53am BST Julian Leeser to move his own amendments on the Indigenous voice referendum Liberal MP Julian Leeser will move his own amendments to the constitutional alteration bill setting up the Indigenous voice referendum, claiming new poll results showed supporters needed to change tack. A poll in the Nine newspapers reported support for the voice has dropped from 58 to 53% over the past month. The Resolve poll found 44% of voters backed the change, 39% were against, and 18% undecided; but when asked a yes/no question, as the referendum will require, yes was supported 53-47. That’s still a likely victory for yes, but the Resolve poll trend shows slipping support for yes. The latest Guardian Essential poll, by the way, shows support for the Indigenous voice was high and remaining steady, with yes supported 59-41. Other published polls have shown voice support in the mid to high 50s. Related: Guardian Essential poll: Labor maintains large lead over Coalition despite budget failing to impress voters Sources in the yes organisation said they expected polls to bounce around during the campaign, noting there was likely still five months until the referendum – and that there was a wide variety of results in various polls.

Far from returning 99% of the revenue windfalls to the bottom line, as promised in October, the government has banked just 40% of improvements in the bottom line since PIFO and spent 60% or more from the massive windfall from strong commodities and job markets. No one wins from a big-spending government in an inflation crisis. At best, the budget fails to address inflation. At worst, it adds fuel to the fire.

Guardian Australia understands Annastacia Palaszczuk told Yvette D’Ath on Tuesday afternoon she would be removed from the health portfolio, just minutes before D’Ath fronted a press conference about the state’s troubled DNA laboratory. There is speculation among government officials that D’Ath will swap roles with attorney-general Shannon Fentiman, a position D’Ath held from 2017 to 2020. The cabinet reshuffles come amid polling showing support for the Palaszczuk government has fallen, as issues in health, youth crime and the housing crisis dominate the local news agenda. A senior government source has told Guardian Australia the reshuffle will target those three key areas. No backbenchers will be promoted, with government advisers expected to keep their jobs. The cabinet overhaul comes 16 months ahead of the election and days after speaker Curtis Pitt announced he would take leave for his mental and physical health. Pitt was absent for most of last week’s regional sitting week in his home town of Cairns. After showing up half an hour late to the first day of sitting week, he told reporters he was unwell and did not return. Palaszczuk first came to power in 2015 and has won three elections.

We applaud the government’s front-foot approach. Universities recognise the pressures students sometimes find themselves under, but cheating is never the answer, no matter how challenging the circumstances. Updated at 3.46am BST 3.25am BST More academic cheating websites blocked at universities The higher education regulator has blocked a further 100 academic cheating websites as the sector aims to crack down on student malpractice at universities. It’s the third time the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency has used protocols with Australia’s major internet service providers to disrupt access to websites targeting students. It brings the number of blocked illegal cheating websites, which sell essays, assignments or accept payment to sit student exams, to 250 in the past year. The Department of Education said illegal cheating websites exposed students to criminals, who often attempt to blackmail students into paying large sums of money. Since using the protocols in August 2022, web traffic from Australia to illegal cheating services have halved compared with the same time in 2021. Under Australia’s anti-cheating laws, individuals face up to two years in prison and fines in excess of $100,000 for providing or promoting academic cheating services. Students are subject to their institution’s disciplinary penalties. It comes as universities remain split over the policing of new chatbot technology including ChatGPT, with concern mounting over the use of artificial technology in assessments and exams.

Those eking out increases of less than 2% are down to about 18.6%, down from more than 50% about two years ago. As for whether the market interpreted these numbers as good or bad for inflation (and hence RBA action soon), the first impression is a bit like the budget. The dollar and stocks have barely budged on the news so it’s a bit “as you were” as far as the prospect of another rate rise goes. Tomorrow’s release of April jobs numbers will be the last set of important stats before the RBA meets again on 6 June (when we might know if the US debt ceiling has caved in).

Now things sound a bit more uncertain as Albanese says discussions are still taking place: Prime Minister Modi had, as well, a bilateral meeting scheduled for Sydney as well. We are in discussions with the Quad leaders over today. We’ll make further announcements about that, but Prime Minister Modi would certainly be a very welcome guest here next week. Prime Minister Kishida, of course, we had bilateral meetings last year, at the end of last year, just a few months ago, in Perth that was very successful. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, would ‘certainly be a very welcome guest’ despite the cancellation of the Quad meeting, Anthony Albanese has said.

Albanese says it’s being reviewed, as are all projects that weren’t Labor commitments. He goes on to recall that the federal and Queensland LNP opposed the project at the time the funding was proposed by Labor. The Gold Coast has been taken for granted by the LNP and the Coalition for a very long period of time. He goes on to flag the resignations of two Liberal MPs from the area but distinguishes Karen Andrews is turning up to parliament unlike the aforementioned Stuart Robert.

Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP Updated at 3.10am BST 2.45am BST Albanese furious that Stuart Robert still receiving ‘pay as a member for Fadden’ The PM also called out the opposition leader Peter Dutton’s nonplussed attitude on the issue, saying the people of Robert’s electorate deserve better: And Peter Dutton seems to think anything goes with regard to members of his team. If you’re a member of parliament, your basic duty – unless there’s a good reason why you’re not in parliament, with other duties or ill health – you have to turn up. And he continues to be paid as the representative of the people of Fadden and they deserve better. To give Alan Tudge credit, at least when he said he was resigning, he stood up in parliament, gave a speech, and was off a week later. So I find it incomprehensible that Peter Dutton finds this behaviour acceptable, that he can continue to get the pay as a member for Fadden and not think that you have to turn up to work.

Just before he just made that big announcement on the Quad leaders meeting not going ahead, Albanese criticised Liberal MP Stuart Robert’s no-show at parliament as “completely unacceptable”. The chaos that I see is the chaos in the LNP. Peter Dutton has lost four shadow cabinet ministers this year. We’re only five months into the year. And yesterday he was out there saying that it’s business as usual for Stuart Robert to be collecting his pay as a member of parliament and as a shadow minister. He said that he’s resigning but he hasn’t resigned, so no date can be set for the byelection, but he’s not turning up to parliament. That is not business as usual. Scott Morrison has foreshadowed leaving at some stage, but he turns up to parliament most of the time. So this is completely unacceptable.

The eleven long-listed novels define Australian literature as a transformative space where writers are singing the songs of the nation today. They reverberate with the cadences of this land where Indigenous sovereignty was never ceded, but also bring to us mellifluous sounds from far-away lands, weaving together literary traditions from around the world. The words of our novelists, grounded in personal experience, poetry and philosophy, are heralds of the new dawn of Australian fiction: they hum and hiss with language that is newly potent and styles that are imaginative and fresh.

We’ll shortly get the WPI for the March quarter, and economists are tipping the number will land at about 3.6% at an annual rate. That would be up from the 3.3% pace in the December quarter but well shy of the consumer prices increase of 7% that we already know about for the March quarter. In the pre-Covid period (if we can remember that time), WPI continually fell short of expectations, and arguably the Reserve Bank should have been lowering interest rates more to help nudge employment and the economy to grow faster. That was then. Now the RBA is worried that wages will pick up too fast although they don’t seem to be talking about a wage price spiral of late (because there hasn’t been one). Still, a number close to 4% for the March quarter will no doubt be viewed as adding to the inflationary concerns that the RBA is trying to quell, and hence another interest rate hike will be in the offing.

The proposed zone in New England will be just 1km wide, likely housing solar and wind farms as well as battery storage. Establishing the site is crucial to NSW plans to transform its system and community input is being encouraged, energy minister Penny Sharpe said today: We need to make sure that the community understands and has input into its development.

NSW premier Chris Minns has this morning hailed the beginning of whale-watching season, sharing the images captured by Jason Sutcliffe (AKA Bondi Ripper) three days ago. The first whales of the season just hit Sydney. You never know, spotting a humpback could help you get through this hump day! 📸 Bondi Ripper pic.twitter.com/13mmWqGbi0 — Chris Minns (@ChrisMinnsMP) May 16, 2023 Whales off Sydney coast Updated at 11.51pm BST 11.30pm BST Minister looking to lift gas price caps Ed Husic says the government will be looking to lift gas price caps if the energy prices return to normal levels: If the gas market and our reforms through the mandatory code work, and we see that stabilisation, then we absolutely would be looking to do that. But we do need to ensure that the way in which these contracts get negotiated, that they get negotiated in a much better way than what we’ve experienced … My preference is certainly as an industry minister, we get rid of the caps as soon as we can – and the best way to do that is to have a stabilised environment and a better bargaining framework. Updated at 11.42pm BST 11.22pm BST Gas has role to play in transition to green energy, Husic says Circling back to the industry minister, Ed Husic, who acknowledges new gas supply might not be “everyone’s cup of tea” but insists gas has a role to play as Australia transitions to green energy: You’ve seen some fairly big announcements in terms of what might happen with Narrabri and Beetaloo. I know that that’s not everyone’s cup of tea but I imagine that, in the interim, those those fields will meet domestic needs. While we work very hard on attending to boost mobile energy generation. Updated at 2.23am BST 11.16pm BST Quad still a priority, White House says Despite the postponement of Joe Biden’s visit, the White House says that partnerships like the Quad remain a priority. The official statement by White House Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says: Revitalizing and reinvigorating our alliances and advancing partnerships like the Quad remains a key priority for the President. This is vital to our ability to advance our foreign policy goals and better promote global stability and prosperity. We look forward to finding other ways to engage with Australia, the Quad, Papua New Guinea and the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum in the coming year. Updated at 11.41pm BST 11.10pm BST Biden cancellation ‘regrettable but understandable’ The industry minister, Ed Husic, says it’s “regrettable but understandable” Joe Biden has had to cancel his visit to Australia. Speaking to ABC Radio, Husic brushed off any concern that if Biden failed in his debt ceiling negotiations and the US defaulted it could be felt in the Australian economy: I think he will obviously be working very hard for this not to happen. We’ve danced this dance before, as the phrase goes … I think we’ll get to a good place and I think that’s why he’s wanting to stay there, to focus on just that. Updated at 11.18pm BST 11.02pm BST Praise for hospital staff Bernadette McDonald also hailed first responders and hospital staff she said responded “beautifully”: I couldn’t get people to go home last night. They were all wanting to stay and actually help in any way possible. It was very calm and very well-controlled and very well responded to last night. Updated at 11.16pm BST 11.00pm BST ‘We have some very traumatised families and children in the hospital’ Bernadette McDonald of the Royal Children’s hospital in Melbourne says she is “extremely surprised” a fatality did not occur from the school bus collision with a truck: Having said that, the children –- I would never say they were lucky. We have to acknowledge that, you know, this was traumatic for every single person that was involved. We have some very traumatised families and children in the hospital at the moment and we’re working extremely hard to provide that trauma support and care that they will need not just now but in the coming weeks and months as well. Updated at 11.13pm BST 10.55pm BST Children to undergo amputations after school bus crash Bernadette McDonald, the chief executive of the Royal Children’s hospital in Melbourne, has given an update on the children seriously injured in yesterday’s collision between a school bus and a truck. At least 10 children aged five to 11 sustained traumatic injuries when the school bus carrying 45 kids collided with a truck and rolled on to its side about 3.40pm yesterday. Just a warning before you read on, these details might distress you. McDonald said one child had complete amputation and number of children were awaiting partial amputation. Children have suffered multiple and traumatic injuries including partial and complete amputations of arms, multiple crushed limb injuries, severe lacerations to head and body, head injuries, glass shard injuries and three patients are receiving spinal support and being monitored carefully in terms of spinal injuries. She said one child was still in intensive care but was likely to come out of intensive care today, and seven remained in hospital. Specialist doctors have been called in to perform emergency surgeries. A code brown was declared after the accident and ended about 8pm. Related: Children seriously injured after school bus collides with truck in Melbourne Updated at 5.27am BST 10.48pm BST PM invited to US for state visit Anthony Albanese says he has been invited to the US for a state visit and will be attending later this year. But there are no firm dates as yet. There is also the possibility that the Quad leaders will get together when they are all in Japan for the G7. So there will be a bilateral between Joe Biden and Anthony Albanese in Japan. There may be a Quad meeting in Japan. Albanese will travel to the US for a state visit but there are no set dates beyond “later this year”. And the Quad meeting in Sydney may progress next week but with a representative of the US instead of Biden, who is dealing with a pesky Congress and Senate. Updated at 11.11pm BST 10.45pm BST Albanese explains why Biden cancelled trip Hello from Canberra, where we are listening to a very tired Anthony Albanese explain why US president Joe Biden can’t make it to Australia next week for the Quad meeting. Albanese says he was up from 4.30am preparing for the phone call. So the US is out of the Quad meeting but there is a bilateral in Japan coming up. The prime minister told ABC radio Sydney that Biden just couldn’t get away because of the latest fight over the US debt ceiling: As the president put to me that week before June 1 will be absolutely critical, which of course is the coming week, and so he would be postponing his visit to Australia. We will have bilateral meeting in Hiroshima. We will both be in Japan over the weekend for the G7 meeting. We had a very good discussion this morning between myself and President Biden and confirmed that he he would be postponing his visit [but] that we would be meeting in Japan. Albanese says he is still talking with India and Japan about meeting next week – a triangle, if you will, with a representative of the US. Updated at 11.10pm BST 10.40pm BST Aukus depends on ‘seamless’ technology transfer, Marles says The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, will say in a speech today that the full ambition of Aukus will only be realised if the transfer of technology and information between Australia and the US is “seamless”. In a keynote address to the American Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide, Marles will say the government is “focused on developing asymmetric technologies that will help deter future conflicts”. But Marles will say that technology transfer barriers in the US and Australia “are vast and complex”. That includes export controls in the US known as international trafficking in arms regulations. He will say Australia has been having “productive” conversations with the US, including the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, about the export controls “and how we can translate that shared understanding and positive intent into action”. Marles will say, according to speech extracts released by his office: We are encouraged by the momentum we’re seeing at all levels across the Australian and US to overcome these hurdles. But we need supportive voices in business to keep this momentum going. Your role in building the seamless defence industrial base between our countries is pivotal, because improving technology transfer and information sharing between the US, the UK and Australia is at the heart of maximising the full potential of the Aukus agreement. Updated at 11.03pm BST 10.37pm BST New rental listings in Sydney lowest in a decade Sydney has recorded a new low in rental listings, with the number of new listings falling 17% month-on-month in April on realestate.com.au – the lowest it has been in a decade. According to the new PropTrack Market Insight, this was the fewest new listings since April 2012. The report goes on to say supply will continue to be a problem for capitals, “exacerbating the competitive conditions renters currently face”. The report adds that while rental listings typically decline in April, the 18.9% month-on-month fall in new listings across the country was the largest decline since 2017. Total listings also fell in the past year, with falls particularly acute in capital cities such as Melbourne (-31.3%), Sydney (-15.7%) and Perth (-19.2%). PropTrack director economic research and report author Cameron Kusher said the results reflected a deepening of the rental crisis across the country: I think in Sydney and Melbourne, there’s potentially more that it could drop. Just because we know that migration to Australia is really strong and we know that most migrants tend to settle in Sydney and Melbourne. I think it’s going to continue to be a problem and the main reason for that is supply takes time. There’s a lot of stock under construction, but most of it has been sold to owner occupiers rather than investors. So that doesn’t really help the rental market. Updated at 11.00pm BST 10.37pm BST Good morning! The defence minister, Richard Marles, is today warning that the full ambition of Aukus will only be realised if the transfer of technology and information between Australia and the US is “seamless”. Marles will be speaking about cutting red tape to work more efficiently with the US and Britain when he delivers a keynote speech to the American Chamber of Commerce today. His speech comes off the back of the breaking news this morning that US President Joe Biden’s visit to Australia as part of the Quad meeting has been cancelled. Biden will return from his international tour early as a result of the deadlock in negotiations with Congress to raise the US debt ceiling. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he and Biden had agreed to reschedule Biden’s first visit to Australia as president at the earliest opportunity. Back home, the housing crisis continues to hit new lows, with Sydney’s new rental listings falling to the lowest they have been in a decade. And the annual wage review will get under way at the Fair Work Commission today, which will consider the pay awards for Australia’s lowest-paid workers. The Australian Council of Trade Union Secretary, Sally McManus, wants to see minimum wage brought into line with CPI at 7%. Let’s get into it! Updated at 1.49am BST</body>

    <head>Snowy 2.0 project making no progress on a number of environmental requirements, report says</head>
    <body>Snowy Hydro’s giant pumped hydro project is in breach of its conditions of approval, with many of its management plans overdue and no progress on its threatened fish and biosecurity programs, the National Parks Association has said. The multibillion-dollar Snowy 2.0 project, already delayed until possibly 2029 with one of its tunnel borers stuck for months, was found to be non-compliant in 15 instances by the third independent audit, completed last year. It also cited 11 additional “opportunities for improvement”. As of 11 May, seven of 16 required management plans had yet to be approved, the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment told the NPA. However, just six of the plans had been posted on Snowy Hydro’s website, leaving the remaining 10 overdue by as much as 31 months, the group said. Related: Snowy Hydro 2.0 project hit by delay of up to two years and another cost blowout The department told the NPA this month it had “taken informal enforcement action (warning letter) against Snowy Hydro on 10 August 2022 for the failure at the time to have a number of management plans approved within the required timeframe”. It would “assess the continued non-compliance”. Ted Woodley, a former energy executive and a co-author of the NPA report, said the whole project – inside the Kosciuszko national park – had been approved subject to a total of 125 environmental conditions being met. “Clearly, almost three years down the track, they’re not being met, and wherever you look, there are plans that haven’t been prepared,” Woodley said. Of concern was the lack of plans to deal with biosecurity risks from the huge project to drill tunnels as long as 27km and build an underground power station. At particular risk was the last remaining colony of the critically endangered stocky galaxias fish. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “None of these plans have been completed, and are now overdue by seven to 19 months,” the report said. “The delays are prejudicing the management of devastating impacts from the future spread of pest fish and pathogens in particular from Talbingo Reservoir up to Tantangara Reservoir and thence throughout the Snowy Mountains and beyond.” Woodley said the biodiversity plans were “extremely important”. “At this stage, it appears that no work whatsoever has been initiated on those plans,” he said. A spokesperson for the commonwealth government-owned Snowy Hydro said it was “disappointed” it had not been consulted by the NPA over its report. “From the outset of the project proposal, Snowy Hydro has liaised closely and regularly with the NSW department of planning and other regulatory bodies,” the spokesperson said. “Snowy Hydro is compliant with the Snowy 2.0 conditions of approval and together with the project contractor, Future Generation Joint Venture, we are operating within the bounds of the construction management plans,” she said, adding some plans were “well under way, pending feedback and input from relevant stakeholder agencies”. Related: ‘It can’t be left to the market’: the closure of Liddell power station and uncertainty of the future A spokesperson for the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said: “The department has been making inquiries into whether Snowy 2.0 is compliant with its federal approval condition for some months. As this is an active matter, the department will not comment further.” A NSW Department of Planning and Environment spokesperson said the department sent Snowy Hydro a warning letter on 10 August 2022 “for failing to submit several management plans within the required timeframe”. “We will take appropriate action as required, in accordance with our compliance policy.” Sue Higginson, the NSW Greens’ environment spokesperson, said the project had “become a long-term serial offender against the vital safeguards put in place to protect Kosciuszko national park”. “Repeated non-compliance with the conditions of approval and little evidence that they are responding to independent audits of their performance indicates a disregard for the sensitive environment of the national park,” she said. Higginson called on the new state government to review urgently last year’s decision to extend the time between external audits from one every 26 weeks to one every 18 months. “This project has effectively become an unstoppable behemoth that is treating the environment and government approvals with little to no regard,” she said. “It is unacceptable that the previous Coalition governments were willing to let these issues slide, but Labor should be acting now to bring this catastrophic project back under control.”</body>

    <head>Melbourne bus crash: truck driver released on bail after several school children injured</head>
    <body>A truck driver charged after allegedly crashing into a school bus in Melbourne’s west on Tuesday, seriously injuring several children, told police flashes of sunlight may have altered his perception, a court has heard. Jamie Gleeson, 49, appeared before Melbourne magistrates court via video link on Wednesday afternoon after he was charged with four counts of dangerous driving causing serious injury. The court heard Gleeson, a truck driver for 18 years, had no drugs or alcohol in his system at the time of the crash, which occurred at the intersection of Exford Road and Murphys Road in Eynesbury about 3.55pm on Tuesday. Prosecutor Ben Kerlin said the bus driver, who was conducting a right-hand turn from Exford Road onto Murphys Road, had seen the truck approaching from behind and tried to accelerate to get out of its path but failed. Kerlin told the court that Gleeson had said to police that he was on his way home from work at the time of the accident, following his “usual route”. He said he would normally “take it easy” in school zones and was accelerating out of the 60km/h zone outside Exford primary school when he noticed “a sun flicker in the trees”, Kerlin told the court. The court heard that Gleeson said he’d encountered the sun flicker while driving down the route before, which could “change distance and depth perception”. “Whether that played a part … I couldn’t tell you,” he said during his police interview on Wednesday morning, Kerlin told the court. Gleeson said he hit the brakes after seeing saw the bus slow down in front of him, but he didn’t have enough time to stop before colliding with it. Kerlin said that, as a result of the collision, nine of the 46 children onboard became trapped on the bus, eight of whom sustained serious injuries. Two children required amputations of their hands and arms, he said. Another 30 children were described by police as “walking wounded”. The charges against Gleeson specifically relate to four children – two each aged nine and 10. Kerlin said more charges could follow. His application for bail was granted, with magistrate Andrew McKenna noting he had no criminal history and had cooperated with police. He is due to return for a committal mention on 18 October. Victoria police Supt Michael Cruse had earlier praised the actions of those first on the scene, who helped emergency workers pull trapped children from inside the wreckage. “The bus driver, despite being injured, I understand that he helped some of the children out of the bus. Then we had passersby who have heroically stopped immediately … assisting the children who could be removed from the bus,” he said. “It was a horrific scene. It was chaotic and it would have been really confronting for those passersby.” The Exford primary school principal, Lisa Campo, was alerted by someone driving past the scene. “We were about to start a staff meeting and I said ‘I have to go’ and they all followed me down. We just flooded the kids,” Campo said. “I honestly thought I would just be there accompanying distressed kids and there had been a minor collision. I didn’t ever expect to see that and I hope I never see that again.” Campo said students would be offered counselling and other support services. Several did not attend on Wednesday; those who did were allowed to wear their pyjamas to school. The chief executive of Royal Children’s hospital, Bernadette McDonald, had earlier said nine children, aged between five and 11, were admitted to the hospital and several required extensive surgery, including one who had undergone a complete amputation of their arm. “The children have suffered multiple and traumatic injuries including partial and complete amputations of arms, multiple crushed limb injuries, severe lacerations to head and body, head injuries and glass shard injuries,” McDonald told reporters on Wednesday. “Three patients are currently receiving spinal support and being monitored carefully, in terms of spinal injuries.” Two children were discharged last night, with seven remaining in a stable condition on Wednesday afternoon. Many children would need to undergo multiple surgeries and long-term rehabilitation was likely, McDonald said. “We’re working extremely hard to provide that trauma support and care that they will need, not just now but in the coming weeks and months,” she said. The state premier, Daniel Andrews, and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, praised the work of first responders. “Any accident is just horrific of this nature,” Albanese said. “The fact that it involves school students just breaks your heart, and my heart goes out to them and their families.”</body>

    <head>Erdoğan … and on? Inside the 19 May Guardian Weekly</head>
    <body>We began planning the cover for this week’s Guardian Weekly magazine wondering if it would mark the end of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s long political career. But it soon became clear that predictions of the Turkish president’s demise had been greatly misjudged. A first-round victory over his secular opponent, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, did not come by a wide enough margin to prevent a runoff vote on 28 May. But, barring a remarkable swing back to Kılıçdaroğlu, the indications are that Erdoğan will further extend his 20-year authoritarian brand of rule over Turkey. Guardian reporters Ruth Michaelson and Jon Henley reflect on last Sunday’s result, while Archie Bland explains why the election was so important and what happens now. To round off, we consider the plight of Turkey’s large population of Syrian refugees, who are facing a bleak future regardless of who emerges victorious in the election. As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, toured European capitals to drum up support this week, speculation continued over when and where Ukraine’s long-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces would begin – or if indeed it had already done so. From Kherson, Luke Harding hears from a frontline commander why Kyiv is happy to bide its time, while defence editor Dan Sabbagh outlines four possible scenarios in which a Ukrainian counterattack might develop. Two environmentally slanted features bring fascinating insights into very different parts of the world. From Kenya there’s the uplifting story of the waste picker who is lobbying for his colleagues’ working rights to be enshrined in a UN treaty. Then, John Bartlett reports from Antarctica on how the climate crisis, geopolitical tensions and booming tourism are straining relations at a remote scientific research station. From The Office to Peep Show, British TV comedies have long held great appeal for the US networks – that is, as long as they can make their own versions. But why does the humour so often get lost in translation, asks Daniel Dylan Wray. Also in Culture this week, Zoe Williams reflects on a Eurovision song contest that was staged in the UK and won by Sweden, but which was really all about Ukraine.

    <head>The Other Fellow review – whimsical film about non-famous James Bonds</head>
    <body>The title of this documentary about real-world men who are named James Bond echoes a famous, winking moment in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service when a young woman runs away after being rescued instead of staying to smooch with her saviour; George Lazenby as Bond, taking over the role from a temporarily retired Sean Connery, wryly says: “This never happened to the other fellow.” The reference is apt because the stories recounted here are all about that glamour gap between the heroic exploits of fictional spy 007 and the regular guys who share his name. Many of the James Bonds met here clearly loathe it when, for the zillionth time, strangers remark that they don’t look like Connery, Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan or Daniel Craig. Some parents named them James Bond before Dr No came out in 1962, or if it was out already, they didn’t think the franchise would become that big a deal. In South Bend, Indiana, James Bond Jr first got into trouble as a teenager with the police when he merely told them his name and the cop thought he was taking the piss, because this Bond happened to be black. Years later he was accused of murder, and during the manhunt the name was in the news a lot, causing problems for another James Bond who lived in the same town. We meet an ex-James Bond who changed his last name, and a kooky Swedish superfan who changed his name to James Bond and runs a museum featuring his collection of adorably shonky Bond memorabilia. The film-makers mostly strive for a whimsical, humorous tone, with quick-cut editing and dramatic recreations of moments in the life of the ornithologist whose name was borrowed by author Ian Fleming. The jocularity, however, is rather punctured by a long story about a woman who was horribly abused by her ex-husband, who kept tracking her down no matter where she moved; she decided to name her son James Bond in order to thwart his efforts to find them because internet searches would throw up so many references to the name. The shift in tone is a bit awkwardly handled; and the film is more than a little repetitious, especially as it twice shows the black-and-white archive clip of Fleming explaining how he chose the name James Bond. • The Other Fellow is released on 19 May in UK cinemas and digital platforms, and is streaming on SBS on Demand in Australia.</body>

    <head>Soldier Sailor by Claire Kilroy review – immersive dive into the baby years</head>
    <body>Claire Kilroy’s first novel in 10 years is a whole-body experience: reading it was, for me, like being elbowed through a rip in the space-time continuum back into the chaotic, exhausting, lovesick fog of the baby and toddler years. Anyone who has endured “the blurred days and the blurred nights” of early motherhood – or indeed anyone contemplating the possibility of embarking on them – be warned. You’re looking at a book-length panic attack. The novel is brief but utterly remorseless – it comes at you full-throttle, as if delivered on a single breath. The internal monologue of a mother (the Soldier of the title) addressed to her son (Sailor), it exists, almost, outside of time. No context is provided, and only Soldier’s perspective is given; this is her description, unqualified and unquestioned, of “all I had lost and all I had gained”. That she’s an unreliable narrator – manifestly, almost luxuriously so – is neither here nor there. The point is that, in a world that has diminished her, reduced her to the near-voiceless role of “mother”, this is her experience. It’s her account of the feeling of finding herself torn out of what she had believed was her real life and deposited in a sleep-deprived, incoherent parallel universe where achieving anything is momentous but anything that is achieved is both negligible and banal. “I produced a shoe only to find you’d pulled off your sock,” she says of the teeth-grinding process of trying to leave the house. “I put the sock back on while you pulled off the other one. I put that one back on while you pulled off the first. Oh, it was all so stupid. People think that looking after an infant is basic. I know this because I once thought so myself.” It’s her experience, but every woman (and as Soldier points out bitterly and bemusedly, it’s almost always a woman) who’s been in sole charge of a small child has lived through this. From the specific visceral sensations of motherhood to the battle to administer Calpol, the “domino effect” of lifting your child out of the buggy and watching it “tip over backwards weighted down by the nappy bag”, the struggle of trying to buckle a writhing toddler into a car seat – it’s all there. And then there are parenthood’s ur-scenarios: the heart-stopping near-misses between heads and swings in playgrounds, the trips to Ikea when you lose your child. (This one actually happened to me. We ran around yelling for five minutes before a kindly older man whispered: “I think he’s hiding in that wardrobe.”) These vignettes are so profoundly recognisable that questions of trustworthiness are shunted sideways. Soldier may not be a reliable narrator – she’s too tired for that and, in fact, as the book progresses she draws attention to the wrinkles and holes in her monologue – but she is a truthful one. We know she’s telling the truth because we’ve been there ourselves. The person who absolutely isn’t there, according to Soldier, is her husband. The father of her child, who appears on the edges of the action complaining that he has an early start at the office and texting “‘What does he eat?’ the one time he was left in charge”, is almost cartoonishly awful: a repository for all the fury and grief and baffled resentment that formerly equal women feel when they’re left holding the baby. He resents spending his “days off” shopping for nursery furniture. He forgets his son’s antibiotics. He doesn’t know what to put in the nappy bag and watches football while his wife packs it instead. There are moments when his frightfulness feels preposterous – but again, this is Soldier’s experience. She’s describing, it seemed to me, not so much a person as the feeling of having had a partner and having lost that partnership; the shock of discovering her relationship is not what she thought it was. “All along I had believed I was equal, when all along I was not,” she says. “All along I had been treading towards this great crevasse called motherhood, and now that I was at the bottom of it looking up … I could see that to have presumed Empire and patriarchy were dead was naive at best. Not only were they alive and well: they had won.” If Kilroy’s novel ended here, it would have done more than enough to locate her among the ranks of motherhood’s laureates alongside the likes of Helen Simpson, Rachel Cusk and Sarah Moss. But it doesn’t. The final section expands – abruptly, beautifully, agonisingly – to grapple with the true existential crisis at the heart of motherhood: the understanding, born with the baby, that we’re all time’s prisoners and “it will do us in in the end”. We crawl out, ultimately, from the chaos of early motherhood, but the love continues to obliterate us. “I wasn’t scared of dying until you were born,” Soldier says towards the novel’s close. Forget the sleepless nights; that’s the real horror, right there. • Soldier Sailor by Claire Kilroy is published by Faber (£16.99).

    <head>Vauxhall maker says Brexit deal must be renegotiated or it could shut UK plant</head>
    <body>The Vauxhall and Fiat manufacturer Stellantis has urged the government to renegotiate rules in the Brexit deal that it says could force it to shut some of its UK operations, putting thousands of jobs at risk. The world’s fourth-biggest carmaker, which also produces Citroën and Peugeot vehicles, said only two years ago that the future of its electric car plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton were safe. However, it now says it can no longer meet rules in the Brexit trade deal that require 45% of parts by value to be sourced in the UK or EU by 2024, after a rise in raw material costs used in electric car batteries during the coronavirus pandemic and the energy crisis. This means electric vans made at the Ellesmere Port site will face tariffs of 10% when exported to mainland Europe from next year because they do not have enough locally sourced parts, putting the future of the plant at risk, the company said. Ellesmere Port, which is due to start electric vehicle production later this year, employs 1,000 workers, while 1,200 are employed in Luton making Vauxhall and Fiat vans. Thousands more people are employed in the UK in businesses linked to the plants. The car industry has long warned that it faces a race against time to comply with the terms of the Brexit deal because the cost of batteries takes up such a large proportion of the value of electric cars. Most electric car batteries are made in Asia, and a flurry of new European factories may not open fast enough to meet soaring demand. Stellantis’s comments are the first explicit call by a carmaker for a renegotiation of the Brexit deal to give it more time to comply. “To reinforce the sustainability of our manufacturing plants in the UK, the UK must consider its trading arrangements with Europe,” Stellantis said, in a submission to a House of Commons inquiry into electric car production first reported by the BBC. It cited extra costs for the UK if it were forced to import batteries, adding: “If the cost of EV manufacturing in the UK becomes uncompetitive and unsustainable operations will close.” Bosses from the manufacturer are due to meet the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, on Wednesday to discuss the issue. The company also wants arrangements for manufacturing parts in Serbia and Morocco to be reviewed. The trade deal is due to be renegotiated in 2025 as part of the original pact between the UK and the EU signed by Lord Frost in December 2020. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the UK needed to improve the Brexit deal. He told the BBC’s Breakfast programme: “Look, we’re not going to re-enter the EU. We do need to improve that deal. Of course we want a closer trading relationship, we absolutely do. “We want to ensure that Vauxhall and many others not just survive in this country but thrive, because there are jobs bound up – there are families watching this morning either employed by Vauxhall or a similar place who are deeply worried about what this means. “So, yes, we need a better Brexit deal. We will make Brexit work. That doesn’t mean reversing the decision and going back into the EU but the deal we’ve got, it was said to be oven-ready; it wasn’t even half-baked.” Stellantis has asked for a renegotiation of the Brexit deal to avert a “threat to our export business and the sustainability of our UK manufacturing operations”. It said the government needs to reach an agreement with the EU to keep the existing rules as they are until 2027. The effect of the rules of origin changes on individual carmakers varies between carmakers. Adrian Mardell, the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, last week said the future of its British factories did not depend on sourcing batteries from the UK, as its Indian owner, Tata, prepares to choose between the UK and Spain for a “gigafactory” to make batteries. However, one car industry expert said Stellantis’s problems may stem from its decision to source batteries initially from China’s CATL, the world’s largest battery maker. Stellantis’s submission noted that it planned to “source batteries from mainland Europe and China”. A government spokesperson said Badenoch “has raised this with the EU”. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said on Wednesday: “Everyone is trying to develop supply of EV batteries, and so we need to have that supply here in the UK. The closer it’s located to the factories that are making the rest of the car, the better. “And all I would say is, watch this space, because we are very focused on making sure the UK gets that EV manufacturing capacity.”</body>

    <head>Meaghan Scanlon promoted to housing minister in surprise Queensland cabinet reshuffle</head>
    <body>Queensland’s environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, will be promoted to housing minister in a cabinet reshuffle aimed to revitalise three critical portfolios ahead of next year’s state election. Senior government sources told Guardian Australia that Scanlon will replace Leeanne Enoch as housing minister, under changes to be announced on Thursday. Scanlon has been the state member for Gaven since 2017 and has been described as a rising star in the Labor caucus. The health and youth justice portfolios will also be targeted in the cabinet shakeup, with the health minister, Yvette D’Ath, reportedly set to swap portfolios with the attorney general, Shannon Fentiman. Related: ‘Crime, coal, crocs’: Palaszczuk’s charm offensive met with blunt reality in north Queensland Ministers and staffers were caught off-guard by the changes, with the news reportedly delivered to D’Ath minutes before she was scheduled to front reporters at a press conference on Tuesday about the state’s troubled DNA laboratory. No backbenchers will be promoted in the reshuffle. Responding to the news, the deputy opposition leader, Jarrod Bleijie, said the Palaszczuk government is “officially in a full-blown state of chaos and crisis”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But political analyst at Griffith University, associate professor Paul Williams, believes the reshuffle is necessary to try to stop criticism of the government in policy areas. “I’m thinking the premier is thinking she needs to blunt opposition and media attack, because these are pretty big Achilles heels that she will take into the next election,” Williams said. “But there’s no guarantee that it will succeed because the issues and the problems run deeper than ministerial control.” Palaszczuk first came to power in 2015 and has won three elections. The reshuffle comes amid polling showing support for Palaszczuk has fallen to its lowest approval rating since her 2015 victory. Williams said there was a risk in the premier restricting her cabinet representation to long-serving ministers. “It lends itself to that old joke about reshuffling deck chairs on the Titanic,” he said. “Tired governments do well by bringing in talent off the backbench.” Pandanus Petter, research fellow at Griffith University’s school of governance and public policy, said it’s unclear how much attention voters pay to cabinet reshuffles. “It’s very tempting to frame this in terms of what it might mean for a future election,” Petter said. “But often people who are going to change their mind [make decisions] based on how they perceive the performance at the time and how their economic conditions are going and if they think a change will help them.” Related: After criticism for ‘reviewing, not doing’, Queensland’s government is now announcing policies on the run Petter said cabinet reshuffles aren’t uncommon. He said Fentiman’s rumoured move to the health portfolio may be a result of her strong performance as attorney general. “It could be that they want Shannon Fentiman to prove her chops in a hard portfolio that’s under attack because she’s done well as attorney general. It won’t be clear until it’s all finalised,” he said. Williams said the move could be a win-win for the Labor government. He said D’Ath was perceived well in her former role as attorney general, so a return to the role would play to her strengths. “Shannon Fentiman in health will be formidable and Yvette D’Ath back as the attorney general will be formidable,” he said. “But given we’re 18 months out from an election, this may not be the last cabinet reshuffle. “The 2024 [election] will be Labor’s toughest since 2012. [The premier] has to throw caution to the wind and embrace change rather than stability.”</body>

    <head>Council in Melbourne declares health emergency, claiming truck pollution is linked to high rates of illness</head>
    <body>A “health emergency” has been declared by a Melbourne council, which claims residents are suffering above-average rates of hospitalisations for certain conditions partly due to a surge in road trains on its suburban streets. Maribyrnong city council, which takes in Footscray in the city’s inner western suburbs, announced the declaration on Wednesday, claiming rates of illness in the municipality due to pollution “considerably exceed the Australian average”. “Council believes this is in part due to the exhaust from heavy trucks, which contains particulate matter, being blown directly into resident’s homes day in and day out from morning to night,” it said in a statement. The health emergency declaration follows long-term frustration about heavy trucks driving through suburban streets around Footscray, even after a curfew was introduced in 2015. Adolescent asthma rates in the City of Maribyrnong are 50% higher than the state average, and the hospital admission rate is 70% higher than the Australian average for those aged between three and 19. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Melbourne’s inner west also has a higher rate of lung cancer than the national average, according to long-term health data cited in a 2020 report published by the Inner West Air Quality Reference Group, made up of experts and residents and set up by the Victorian government in 2018 in response to local concerns. Complaints from residents near Moore Street in Footscray have surged in recent times due to the construction of the West Gate Tunnel, with allegations that road trains are ignoring the 8pm to 6am curfew or receiving exemptions. Maribyrnong councillors are writing to the Victorian roads and road safety minister, Melissa Horne, claiming a lack of monitoring and enforcement of the curfew has undermined its ability to protect residents. The council wants the government to begin monitoring air pollution and the health of residents. The motion was moved by Greens councillor Bernadette Thomas. The council’s mayor, Labor-aligned Sarah Carter, also spoke about the need for action. “Our residents tell us at least as many heavy trucks are using residential streets now as they did before the curfew was introduced,” Carter said. She singled out road trains – which are larger and longer than standard trucks and that have been allowed to carry concrete castings to the tunnel site – as posing particular health risks. The Maribyrnong Truck Action Group, which has campaigned on the issue, said the council area experiences more than eight million truck movements each year on residential streets, due to container trucks servicing the Port of Melbourne. “The City of Maribyrnong is ground zero for truck pollution in Australia and our health needs protection now,” said Martin Wurt, the group’s president. “This was a bold move by our councillors, we now need follow-up action to alleviate this health crisis,” Wurt said. He said “hospitalisation rates for children in the City of Maribyrnong with respiratory illness is shocking”. “We need a plan to get these rates down as fast as possible,” he said. Guardian Australia contacted Horne for comment.</body>

    <head>Quad summit cancelled after Joe Biden calls off trip to Australia</head>
    <body>Anthony Albanese has confirmed the Sydney Quad meeting will not go ahead, after US president Joe Biden pulled out of his Australian visit to deal with domestic issues. Early Wednesday morning Albanese was still hopeful the meeting with the leaders of India and Japan could proceed with a senior representative from the US, but hours later he confirmed the event was off. Instead, the Quad nations are expected to have a sideline meeting at the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend, with all four leaders still attending. Related: Biden cancels Australia and Papua New Guinea visit as debt limit crisis looms While a meeting is yet to be locked in for the Japan gathering, Albanese said it was “appropriate that we talk”. “The Quad is an important body and we want to make sure that it occurs at leadership level and we’ll be having that discussion over the weekend,” he said. Biden’s visit to Australia, with a historic stop to Papua New Guinea having been confirmed in recent weeks, had been long anticipated and would have included an address to the parliament. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Instead, Albanese will hold a bilateral meeting with Biden in Japan, and has been invited to the US later this year for a state visit. It is not known when Biden will be able to reschedule his Australian trip. The postponement, due to hostile negotiations with the Republican-heavy US Congress over the government’s debt ceiling, comes at a delicate time in the US’s engagement with the Pacific region. The visit was supposed to help cement the US’s renewed interest in the Indo-Pacific and help quell regional concerns over the Aukus agreement. In a radio interview speaking on the postponement, Albanese stressed Biden’s commitment to the Quad arrangement. “President Biden emphasised the importance of the Quad,” he said. “He was very disappointed at some of the actions of some members of Congress and the US Senate. We long ago passed the time where opposition parties tried to hold up supply in Australia … but that effectively is what you’ve got in the US at the moment. “And obviously the domestic priority for the president, understandably, is to play a role in resolving those issues.” Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese. Photograph: Mark Baker/AP Albanese confirmed that the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, would still visit Australia next week for a bilateral meeting and to make a public address in Sydney. “I look forward to welcoming him to Sydney. He made me a very welcome guest in March and he is the host of the G20 this year,” Albanese told ABC Radio Brisbane. But Albanese indicated that the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, was no longer likely to visit Australia. He noted Kishida had visited Perth late last year, and Albanese would attend the G7 summit hosted by Kishida this weekend. Formally called the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the US, Japan, India and Australia relationship was formed during the international response to the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, officially meeting for the first time in 2007. It was disbanded in 2008, although the history of Quad 1.0 remains contested, with some blaming the Australia government under Kevin Rudd for pulling back in a bid not to upset China, while others point to the US’s own go-slow approach for the break. It was revived at the 2017 Asean summit at a ministerial level, while Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister and Donald Trump was US president. Further meetings were held between the four nations, including among defence personnel, and “leaders’ summits” have been held since 2021. The Quad was instrumental in creating the concept of the “Indo-Pacific”, instead of the Asia Pacific, in a nod to the ties between the nations between the Indian and Pacific oceans.</body>

    <head>The great escapes: football’s best late-season runs to avoid relegation</head>
    <body>“My team, Cambridge United, won five of their last nine matches to escape relegation by a single point,” tweets Simon Gleave. “What is the most wins in the last nine matches by teams occupying relegation places? And did they survive?” Having started the bidding at five, Simon immediately ups the ante: “Bournemouth won six of their last nine in 1995 to relegate Cambridge from the third tier.” Mark Mitchener also nominates the Cherries for a failed escape in 2008. “Bournemouth won six of their last seven (and seven out of nine) in League One after being deducted 10 points for entering administration. They were relegated by two points.” Related: Which teams have endured the least successful seasons in football history? | The Knowledge Staying in the third tier, Wayne Ziants suggests AFC Wimbledon in 2018-19. “We were 10 points from safety until a win at Walsall in game 32 started a run of seven wins, five draws and two defeats. That lifted us out of the relegation zone, with a final-day 0-0 at Bradford keeping us up on goal difference.” Those last nine games: three wins, five draws and one defeat. “In 1957-58, Lincoln won their last six Division Two matches to survive by one point – they had only won five matches up to then, and lost their previous nine,” notes Scotty Walden. In fact, the Imps didn’t win a game between early December and Easter Tuesday, a run of 18 winless matches. They won at Barnsley to kickstart their run, ending with a 3-1 victory over Cardiff in a rearranged fixture. Let’s look over some memorable recent top-flight examples, starting with Fulham in 2007-08. “Under Roy Hodgson, the team won five and drew one of the last nine games,” writes Richard Hirst. “Fulham stayed up on the last day of the season thanks to Danny Murphy’s header at Portsmouth. The next season we finished seventh, qualified for the Europa League and the rest is history.” Fulham’s Danny Murphy and Jimmy Bullard celebrate after the final whistle at Fratton Park. Photograph: Chris Ison/PA Other honourable Premier League mentions include Oldham in 1992-93 – who matched Fulham’s five wins and one draw in their last nine games – and Bradford in 1999-00 with three wins and a draw in their last five games. Perennial escapees Sunderland are also in the mix for 2013-14 (four wins and a draw, all in their last six games) and 2015-16 (three wins, five draws in their last nine). West Ham’s controversial escape in 2006-07 takes us to a new height of seven wins in their last nine, with two defeats coming against Chelsea and, er, Sheffield United. Dean Whearty can offer two examples that edge out the Hammers by a point, starting with Wigan in 2011-12: “Seven wins and one draw in their last nine, including huge wins against Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal, lifting them to 15th.” Another Premier League team can match that record. “In 2014-15, Leicester went into their final nine games rooted to the bottom of the table with 19 points, seven from safety,” adds Dean. “Their run-in produced seven wins, one draw and one defeat, propelling them from 20th to 14th. They didn’t do too bad in the season after that, either.” Finally, some examples of great escapes from around Europe: Crotone, 2016-17 Serie A: six wins, two draws in last nine games Tondela, 2015-16 Primeira Liga: five wins, two draws in last nine Eintracht Frankfurt, 1998-99 Bundesliga: four wins, two draws Werder Bremen, 2019-20 Bundesliga: four wins, one draw (via playoff) Cagliari, 1990-91 Serie A: three wins, five draws in last nine Crotone’s great escape was sparked by a home win over Internazionale. Photograph: Albano Angilletta/AP Points make … percentages “Dundee won the Scottish Championship with 63 points: 58% of the total points available,” notes Stefan Arnott. “What is the lowest percentage of points won for a team to win the league?” Chris Roe kindly steps up to do the hard work for us again. “Dundee amassed their points total from 36 games this season,” he begins. “The maximum they could have scored was 108, so the total points percentage was 58.33%. Pos Team P GD Pts 1 Dundee 36 26 63 2 Ayr 36 18 58 3 Queen&apos;s Park 36 11 58 4 Partick 36 20 57 5 Morton 36 10 57 “In the top four English divisions there has only been one instance where a team winning the division has had lower than this, namely Burnley in the 1981-82 season in the third tier, where they collected 80 points from their 46 games. The maximum they could have scored would have been 138, so their points were 57.97% of those available. “However, over time the number of points for a win has changed from two to three, so if we had standardised points scored at always being three for a win, then Everton in 1914-15 would have scored 65 points from 38 games (57.02%); one of the nine seasons in which Dundee’s figure would have been beaten. “At the other end of the spectrum, Manchester City’s 100-point season in 2017 took 87.72% of the available points, which has only been bettered by Preston North End in the inaugural Football League season in 1888-89 (90.91%).” Preston won 18 of their 22 games, claiming 40 points from 44 available (90%) – adjusted to three points for a win, it’s still a City-shading 87.88%. Keeping it clean “In Sunderland’s last game of the season at Preston, the team committed one foul (compared to 18 by Preston),” mails Paul Oakley. “Has a team ever recorded zero fouls and what are the fewest number of fouls recorded in any game?” Stephan Wijnen can help here. “In the Netherlands, since the data on this subject has been kept (from 2010-11 onwards), it has happened twice in the Eredivisie, both in the current season,” he writes. “As recently as 23 April, Feyenoord didn’t commit a single foul in their 3-1 win over FC Utrecht (who made seven), while on 3 September last year, FC Volendam didn’t give away any fouls against Sparta Rotterdam. For them this wasn’t a good thing though, given they lost 4-0. Sparta made four fouls, which means there were only four in that entire match.” But there are more. “Arsenal hosted Dundalk in the Europa League in October 2020, with the Irish side recorded as not committing a foul,” mails Brian Walsh. “Here are the official stats.” Jamie Fitzgerald was another to flag Dundalk’s “achievement” but he has two more examples: Chelsea going without a foul during their 1-0 home defeat by West Ham in November 2019. Even more impressive was Derby v Grimsby in the 2016-17 League Cup (this suggests the Mariners gave away the solitary match foul). Arsenal’s Nicolas Pépé scores their third goal in the 3-0 win over Dundalk. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Knowledge archive “Can someone please tell me why the Atlético Madrid club crest contains what looks like a bear trying to get jiggy with a cherry tree?” wondered Steve Guy in 2007. Steve had obviously never been to the Puerta del Sol in Madrid, because he would have seen the 20-tonne statue known as El Oso y el Madroño, a life-size model of a bear doing nothing more than sniffing a Madroño tree.

    <head>‘Camavinga left-back?’: how luck led to Real Madrid’s new dimension</head>
    <body>It wasn’t the first time that necessity proved the mother of invention, and it won’t be the last that what was meant to be a stopgap turned into more than a stroke of luck – and, in a not so distant future, may even be seen as a stroke of genius. Had Lucas Hernandez not been injured in France’s first game at the 2022 World Cup, Eduardo Camavinga would not have played at left-back for Les Bleus against Tunisia and Argentina later in the tournament. Similarly, had Ferland Mendy and David Alaba not been unavailable for a Real Madrid La Liga fixture against Real Sociedad in late January of this year, it is unlikely Carlo Ancelotti would have imitated Didier Deschamps and deployed his 20-year-old midfielder in a position Camavinga knew very little about until six months ago – a position in which he gave such a brilliant display in the first leg of Real’s semi-final against Manchester City that a madridista paper gave him 10 out of 10 in its ratings, regardless of the misdirected pass which led to Kevin De Bruyne’s equaliser. Related: ‘Dream come true’: Pep Guardiola hails Manchester City’s pursuit of the treble No one would have predicted this back in November. Deschamps’s decision had taken everybody by surprise at home. He had tested his young player at left-back in a warm-up friendly against the Qatari side Al-Gharafa and been pleased enough to field him there again when France, already qualified for the last 16, met Tunisia in their final group game. It was not a resounding success. Tunisia won 1-0 and Deschamps was fiercely criticised for his choice. The former Marseille coach Rolland Courbis thundered on national radio: “Camavinga left-back? Why not the physio?” It was one thing to deploy Antoine Griezmann as a deep-lying regista, quite another to ask a youngster with four caps, all as a central midfielder, to try a new role in the biggest of all tournaments. Yet it is on the left of defence that Camavinga played, and very well, the last 49 minutes of an epic final. One of the most striking features of Camavinga’s reinvention is that the two managers who engineered it are not thinkers in the Pep Guardiola mould. Both learned and perfected their trade in Serie A, a league which, during their time there, in the era of Arrigo Sacchi, could be associated with tactical refinement and a quasi-scientific approach but not with experimentation for the sake of it. Both are pragmatists, superb readers of the flow of a game, exceptional leaders of men. They have knowhow, experience and principles, but neither could be considered “system coaches” by any stretch of the imagination. Camavinga, 20, had always played in midfield until Deschamps asked him to play at left-back for France six months ago. Photograph: Mutsu Kawamori/Aflo/Alamy Camavinga’s transformation was not informed by an urge to try the untried, but by the gradual realisation that this young footballer possessed qualities which could blossom into something very special if put to good use in a different context. Counterintuitive as the process may have seemed from the outside, it was no less organic for that. The square peg was not forced in the round hole; it now feels like a natural fit, an “invention” in the original sense, that is: a find. Wednesday’s game will be only the 20th in which Camavinga operates from the left of defence, yet what we’ve seen of him there suggests that he may – just may – set a template for a new understanding of what this role could be. We’ve had plenty of marauding full-backs who could turn into auxiliary wingers, from Giacinto Fachetti to Manuel Amoros to Cafu in the past to Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold today. Thanks, in particular, to Guardiola and his former assistant Mikel Arteta, we also have had a number of full-backs who can “tuck in” and bring numerical superiority in midfield, such as Philipp Lahm, David Alaba, João Cancelo, John Stones and Oleksandr Zinchenko. What we have not had until now – until Camavinga – is a full-back who could combine both these dimensions in a single, thrilling package, one whose influence could, just as much as Vinícius Júnior’s or De Bruyne’s brilliance, determine the fate of this semi-final. There is always the temptation, when speaking of so young a footballer, to rein in expectations for fear of succumbing to hyperbole and harming the development of a prodigious talent. It should be resisted. Camavinga has the athleticism and stamina required of the most physically demanding role in modern football. He has the touch, raw pace and dribbling ability of a winger. Most importantly, he has the intelligence, passing range and vision which astonished onlookers when, aged 16, he masterminded a shock 2-1 win for Rennes over Paris Saint-Germain in 2019. Players blessed with such a profusion of gifts are not usually found at left-back. But then, Eduardo Camavinga isn’t your usual kind of left-back.</body>

    <head>Small firms could be entitled to thousands from insurers after Covid payment ruling</head>
    <body>Hundreds of thousands of small businesses that claimed on their insurance during the Covid pandemic but had their payouts delayed could be owed thousands of pounds after a ruling by the UK’s financial ombudsman. In what campaigners say is a key test case, the complaints body has ruled that a dental practice whose claim had been initially declined but later approved should be paid interest by QBE, one of the largest insurers in the world. The ombudsman has ruled that an 8% annual rate of interest should be paid on the sum pro rata over the period between the claim being declined and it being paid, opening up the potential for many more businesses to make similar claims. About 370,000 small businesses, from restaurants and bars to hairdressers and guesthouses, made insurance claims to a total value of approximately £1.2bn after the coronavirus lockdowns left them unable to trade. Many of those policyholders – including the former footballer Gary Neville, who co-owns two hotels with his former Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs – had their claims initially declined on the grounds that the business interruption policies were not designed to cover a government-imposed lockdown. In 2020, the high court found in favour of policyholders after the Financial Conduct Authority brought a test case to court, but six of the eight insurers named in the case: Arch Insurance, Argenta, Hiscox, MS Amlin, QBE and RSA – appealed. It was not until the supreme court ruled in the policyholders’ favour in 2021 that the claims were paid out. The dental practice, in Cornwall, made its claim against QBE, with the support of loss assessors Salmon Assessors. Jeff Salmon, the chief executive of Salmon Assessors, said: “It’s important to stress that this additional payment only applies to policyholders who made successful business interruption claims.” The dental practice had made its initial claim in April 2020 but did not receive their payout and £250 in compensation until “late 2021”, with QBE advising that it would wait for the supreme court to make its judgment before settling the claim. In the judgment, the ombudsman concluded that QBE should pay a further 8% interest from two months after the dentistry practice made the initial claim. “The Covid-19 pandemic and surrounding circumstances presented a novel situation for insurers,” the ombudsman wrote. “I recognise that there was some uncertainty about whether the wording of certain types of clause would cover claims. This was part of the reason for the FCA test case. But whilst the court judgments provided clarity, this does not mean QBE was unable to have reached a different conclusion to the one it did prior to the judgments.” A QBE spokesperson said: “We have complied with the ruling of the ombudsman for this individual complaint and consider this matter closed.”</body>

    <head>Used condoms allegedly mailed to dozens of Melbourne women in ‘targeted attack’</head>
    <body>Dozens of women living across Melbourne’s south-east are alleged to have received used condoms in the mail and graphic messages for more than two months, sparking a police hunt for the person behind it. More than 60 women who attended the same school during the late 1990s have reported the disturbing mail to police. The packages have also contained handwritten letters detailing graphic messages. Police say the offender or offenders used a student-created yearbook from Kilbreda College Mentone’s class of 1999, which contained the home addresses of pupils. The first letter was received on March 20 and the most recent was received on Monday. Kilbreda College was helping police with their inquiries as officers analysed DNA and handwriting, police said. “We’re keeping an open mind in relation to any relationships to the school or the students, or someone who has no association to the school whatsoever,” detective senior dergeant Grant Lewis said on Wednesday. “It’s quite possible this yearbook, which had addresses on it, may have been found by someone who was not associated with the school and may have just thought it ... (was) a joke to start with and now it has become quite serious.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Police urged people who could identify the offender or offenders to come forward. Lewis said there were also secondary victims in the case given some of the former students’ parents received the letters, rather than their children who had long moved out of home. “Some of these people who are receiving this mail and material are quite old so it’s quite traumatising for them and upsetting,” he said. Bree, who did not want to provide her surname, was among the victims. She said students included their names in the yearbook to keep in touch in the pre-social media era. Her mother opened the letter. “Her reaction was quite shocked and she was quite upset,” Bree said. “I was very freaked out [and] didn’t sleep that night. “The next day I heard of another girl who had received the same or similar type of letter and then there was another one.” Bree created a Facebook group, leading more of her former classmates to say they too received a letter. The letter Bree received was graphic and sexual, she said. “It was completely disgusting, not something that you would expect in the mail,” Bree said. “Some of our parents are quite elderly and some parents are sick and some of the girls are unwell at the moment. It’s just the last thing anybody needed. “We can’t think of anybody who has a grudge against us.” In a statement, Victorian police said officers were treating this as a “targeted attack”. “It is believed that most of those who reported the material have received multiple letters, all with the suspected used item included.” – with Australian Associated Press</body>

    <head>Jetstar check-in to close earlier in bid to make flights more reliable and punctual</head>
    <body>Jetstar passengers will need to arrive at the airport earlier after the airline tightened check-in and bag-drop times in a bid to improve its reliability and punctuality. From next Tuesday, the budget carrier will close check-in for domestic flights within Australia and New Zealand 40 minutes prior to departure, bumping it up from 30 minutes. The carrier will also cut the check-in time allowed for international flights by 15 minutes, requiring passengers to complete check-in and bag drop-off 60 minutes before departure. The boarding gate for international and domestic flights will close 20 minutes before the flight departs, up from 15 minutes. Related: Australian airlines push back on calls to compensate passengers for delays and cancellations Jetstar’s chief operating officer, Matt Franzi, said the airline was working to strengthen its operations while delivering low-fare flights. “We know our performance hasn’t been up to scratch and we are working hard to boost punctuality and reliability,” he said. It comes after the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics released figures in April finding Jetstar was the least punctual airline in Australia, with 7.1% of flights cancelled. Last year, about 4,000 Jetstar passengers were left stranded in Bali for up to a week after mass flight cancellations. The carrier said the new check-in times bring it in line with other budget airlines. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Bonza, Australia’s newest budget airline which launched earlier this year, also closes check-in and bag drop-off for domestic flights 40 minutes prior to departure. However, the boarding gate closes 10 minutes before departure, giving its passengers 10 minutes longer than Jetstar customers to get to the gate. Jetstar’s new rules are on par with Ryanair, an Irish budget carrier that operates across the UK and Europe. Ryanair shuts check-ins 40 minutes before flights depart, and closes boarding 20 minutes before departure. Alan Kirkland, the chief executive of Choice, said it was good to see Jetstar working to address its problems with flight reliability. But he urged the airline to be flexible about the changes initially, and to give its customers ongoing warnings of the new rules. “Customers are used to the check-in times that have stood for many years and it would be really unfair if someone was denied boarding soon after these changes and ended up having to book a new flight due to changes Jetstar made,” he said. Jetstar said it would also be hiring more airport staff, cabin crew and engineers to increase its reliability. “Everyone across the airline is committed to getting Jetstar to its best while delivering the lowest possible fares so our customers can fly to more places, more often.”</body>

    <head>‘We have to be more than athletes’: inside the women’s US soccer league</head>
    <body>The women’s locker room is supposed to be a safe space. And yet its feeble record for warding off unwanted attention is underscored time and again in TV tropes and class-action lawsuits. It goes a long way to explaining why, despite the abundance of fly-on-the-wall sports documentaries, you’d be hard-pressed to name one that follows a women’s team as closely and earns enough trust to linger. Related: Ryan Reynolds wants to expand his sports empire. Will Snoop stop him? In so many ways director Arlene Nelson is breaking the mold with Angel City, a three-part HBO Sports doc that goes inside the same-named LA franchise pushing for change on and off the pitch. The series embeds with the team over the course of the 2022 season, as the National Women’s Soccer League was reeling from an internal investigation that implicated five coaches and a general manager in a toxic workplace scandal marked by verbal abuse, racist remarks and sexual misconduct. “It was really important for us to assure them that we appreciate the need for that protection,” says Nelson, who came to this project from a Secrets of Playboy miniseries that unmasked Hugh Hefner as a predator and sadist. “It was a delicate dance, trying to find that balance of being respectful while also getting the story right.” It’s a complex tale. Angel City FC was born in the wake of the Time’s Up movement from a majority female ownership that includes the actor-activist Natalie Portman, the venture capitalist Kara Nortman and the Hollywood exec Julie Uhrman. The story is as much about them trying to prove pro women’s soccer can carve out a viable niche in the entertainment-saturated LA market as it is about whether there’s even profit to be had within a league experiment on its third draft, the NWSL being the first to make it past year three. Much of the reason for optimism comes down to Portman, a soccer naif too bold and blunt to let the game’s entrenched biases and business practices stunt her ambition. Her persistence, too, is awe-inspiring. “She does a really good job of asking ‘Why is this happening?’ and then putting in the work behind it to change things,” says Julie Foudy, the former US National Team captain turned Angel City investor. All the while Angel City is bidding to finish with a winning record in its launch season – a near impossible feat for an expansion team. And they add to the degree of difficulty by not making any trades or roster cuts unless by player request. The idea is to provide a sense of security within a league that was capricious about on-field shake ups before assenting to a collective bargaining agreement. But it comes at the expense of Angel FC’s ability to make roster upgrades throughout the season and really bites them hard when a slew of injuries wipe out their offensive lines. Equally daunting was the job of capturing all this drama. Where HBO’s Hard Knocks has small armies of people to embed with key characters and permission to hide cameras around NFL team facilities, Nelson filmed Angel City with a 40-person crew, squeezing that number like an accordion while haggling with the team over shooting opportunities; so it goes when your subject team doesn’t have its own training complex. “It was incredibly challenging having to figure out which storylines we were going to follow,” Nelson says. Many times a story would continue unfolding after production had exhausted its allotted filming time, forcing Nelson to grab a go-bag and get the footage herself. “I had my camera in the garage at the ready, batteries always charged,” she says. “When Sydney Leroux was traded from Orlando, I scrambled from Culver City to catch her arriving at LAX with her kids.” Nelson made a point of assembling a production team that was as female and inclusive as Angel FC. But the effort didn’t score the hoped-for points. Members of the team still come off guarded and vigilant. At one point in the first episode Uhrman is at the team office in Santa Monica kibitzing with her twin sister Amy Longhi (a marketing consultant for the team) about Amy’s habit of ignoring her car’s fuel gauge. “Again?” she exclaims, swiveling around to the fly on the wall. “Did you hear this?” “Why are we talking into camera?” Amy shoots back nervously. It’s the kind of exchange you’d never see in sports docs about men, who disrobe as easily as they lay bare their darkest professional fears in front of viewers. Sportswomen, on the other hand, don’t have nearly as much practice or protection in similarly vulnerable moments, let alone a Last Chance U-type project to offer some guidance on how to relax around a film production that’s designed to style them as larger than life. So it figures Angel City players would be suspicious when Nelson’s camera crew approach from a low angle. How could it not feel intrusive when women athletes are already sharing so much of themselves as a matter of course. “We have to be more than athletes just to, you know, make money,” says the defender Madison Hammond. “I look at male athletes on social media and there’s nothing about their weekend, who they’re with, why they’re with. All their pictures will be from their sport. Kara Nortman, Natalie Portman and Julie Uhrman Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP “But then I look at my peers, my teammates – even myself, I’m posting what brands I like to use or where I’m going on the weekend. People have to think I’m a person.” Hammond is a documentary subject out of central casting: a Black Native American from New Mexico who happens to be the niece of the former PGA Tour fixture Notah Begay. When she wasn’t starring on Wake Forest’s ascendent soccer team, she was playing violin in the Demon Deacons orchestra. If this were Hard Knocks, that skill wouldn’t just be captured on camera; it’d be fodder for a cold open. But Hammond never felt like she could ever bare that much of herself. “I just heard different stories about how there’d been cameras and boom mics everywhere and, you know, that’s not something I had ever experienced as an athlete,” says Hammond, traded to the team weeks into shooting. “It’s difficult to kind of put those walls down to let people in and just continue operating like you normally would.” It’s hard not to wonder how much richer the Angel City story could have been with the benefit of more access and time. “We wanted to go deeper and highlight players even more,” Nelson says, “but it was a challenge to keep everything to three hours.” Still, it would be a shock if Angel City was a one-off for HBO, still the sports documentary gold standard. The network just began streaming US women’s national team matches this year in the run-up to the Women’s World Cup later this summer. As the Americans attempt to become the first team – men or women – to win three titles in a row, US support figures to be massive again even with the tournament scattered across Australia and New Zealand. Domestic TV ratings for the 2018 women’s final were 22% higher than the men’s. There’s always been an audience for high-level women’s soccer – which, for young fans in particular, is every bit as absorbing as the men’s game, if not more. Angel City, plenty gratifying on its own, doesn’t just prove the need for sports docs that center women; it serves up an excellent template. “In 15 years, when the NWSL is huge and people are making millions of dollars playing women’s soccer, this documentary will be a very interesting snapshot in time,” Hammond says. “Like, seriously, there was a moment when we weren’t gonna do that?” Angel City is now available on HBO Max in the US and in the UK at a later date</body>

    <head>Afternoon Update: truck driver charged after school bus crash; young Australians spending less; and arson suspected in Wellington fire</head>
    <body>Good afternoon. Details are still emerging about a “horrific” bus crash on the western outskirts of Melbourne yesterday, which saw the vehicle carrying 45 primary school children roll over after a collision with a truck. Seven children were seriously injured, including one who has undergone a complete arm amputation. The Victorian premier praised first responders, while the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said, “the fact that it involves school students just breaks your heart”. In other news, this year’s Falls festival has been cancelled and young Australians are spending less. Top news Emergency services personnel at the scene of a bus crash in Melbourne’s west on Tuesday.

Instead, the Quad nations are expected to have a sideline meeting at the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend, with all four leaders still attending. Analysis: the cancelled summit is a win for China and a self-inflicted blow to the US’s Pacific standing, Daniel Hurst, our foreign correspondent, writes.

Wages rise again | The March quarter wage price index rose to an annual rate of 3.7% in the first three months of 2023 – economists had expected it to increase 3.6%. It still falls well short of annual inflation, however, which hit 7% in the March quarter. Spending by over-35s has increased by 7.7%, almost double the increase in spending by young Australians.

However, spending by over-35s has increased by 7.7%, almost double the increase in spending by those under 35. Older cohorts, who may have paid off mortgages and have limited household expenses, increased their expenditure by as much as 13%.

A joint bid by a conglomeration of media companies which sought leave to name the accused man was rejected by the court in February as premature.

    <head>The Russo-Ukrainian War by Serhii Plokhy review – the first draft of history</head>
    <body>At the time of writing this review, we still await the big Ukrainian counter-offensive. On its success or failure will depend the future course of the war. In February, when the detailed planning for the Big Push was already starting, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told me how nervous he was about it. Such frankness is typical of him. A charming, natural-seeming former actor, he has brought his professional abilities to the job of representing Ukraine at the highest level: providing the roar, he says, channelling Winston Churchill. We know that the United States believes Ukraine’s counter-offensive won’t ultimately succeed, because we’ve seen the leaked documents that say so. But, of course, on the morning of 24 February 2022, Washington was sure the Russians would capture Kyiv within days – as were the Russians themselves. Zelenskiy’s decision to stay put, against American advice, was one of the main reasons Ukraine has proved so successful. So, as historian Serhii Plokhy shows in this sober, thoughtful, honest account of the war up to now, was the courage and grit of the 300 Ukrainian soldiers guarding Hostomel Airport outside Kyiv, who shot down several Russian helicopters and ensured that even when the others landed they didn’t have control of the skies. Basically, though, the Russians defeated themselves, with their shocking incompetence. Some of the tanks destroyed on the approaches to Kyiv contained parade uniforms for the expected victory celebrations, and the invaders brought no more than three days’ worth of food with them. Russian military intelligence had lined up various senior Ukrainians to take control in Kyiv; but when they saw Russia’s failure at Hostomel they backed down abruptly. That morning the Kremlin’s press department had put out a statement talking about the imminent overthrow of “the band of drug addicts and neo-Nazis” that had “taken the whole Ukrainian people hostage”. By the afternoon, when the inhabitants of Kyiv failed to welcome their liberators as Putin had been told to expect, that approach wasn’t looking so good. Ukraine’s army has done well for three main reasons. Its morale has been sky high. The weaponry that Nato has supplied is mostly a lot better than Russia’s. (To that extent, the Kremlin’s self-pitying claims of being at war with Nato are correct.) The third reason is the remarkable transformation in the military doctrine of the Ukrainian forces. When a high-powered Nato military team visited Kyiv before Russia’s takeover of Crimea in 2014, it found that the Ukrainian army was much like the Russian one, and the Soviet army before them: rather than take a decision and risk punishment, junior officers would pass the buck to their seniors, and the seniors would refer upwards to Moscow. The Nato team taught the Ukrainians that any decision, even a wrong one, was better than no decision at all, and that, cowardice or treachery excepted, there should be no punishment for orders that turned out to be wrong. Liberated by this, the Ukrainian forces have made the Russians look sclerotic and antiquated. Whatever happens now, Putin has demonstrated Russia’s incompetence for the whole world to see. This book is appearing far too soon to be a definitive account of the war, of course. Plokhy, a Harvard professor of Ukrainian background and the author of the magnificent Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy, says himself that it arose from the “shock, pain, frustration, and anger” caused by the invasion; yet it is a fine, scholarly, unemotional chronicling of the war’s origins and early stages. It comes alive when it uses diaries and testimony from people in places like Bucha, outside Kyiv, where 1,650 were killed, nearly half of them shot at point-blank range, sometimes after unspeakable torture. Yet Plokhy keeps his academic distance. There is no ranting. Did the US promise Russia it wouldn’t expand Nato beyond the borders of East Germany? If some members of the George HW Bush administration did say this, it was entirely unofficial: no such promises were made public. Should Nato have expanded to take in so much of Russia’s former empire? “You have no idea how desperate the Baltic states, Poland, the Czechs, the Romanians and the others are to join,” a senior Nato diplomat told me at the time. “They’re yelling at us that we’ve got to protect them in case Russia comes calling.” The invasion of Ukraine shows how right they were; Putin’s assurances have turned out to be utterly meaningless. In March 2014, after capturing Crimea in contravention of two international treaties, he promised not to take any more Ukrainian territory. By February 2022 he was calling the whole of Ukraine “historically Russian land”. The invasion, and its accompanying atrocities, have made any simplistic Elon Musk-style “Crimea for Donbas” deal impossible for years to come. Anything can happen now: a sudden victory for Ukraine, a long and bitter stalemate, the overthrow of Putin, all-out nuclear war. This impressive and valuable book can’t tell us which. But it is a clear, reliable and (in the circumstances) remarkably calm account of how we got here. • John Simpson is the BBC’s world affairs editor.

    <head>Collingwood’s Field of Dreams model fails with Magpies project unable to take flight</head>
    <body>As the sun set on the ANZ Championship in 2016, the most salient question centred around where three new teams would come from to form a standalone Australian competition. Five Australian teams participated in the trans-Tasman league, all of which had history dating back to the start of the Commonwealth Bank Trophy in 1997 and were owned by their respective state netball associations. Things moved quickly and with little time to build the kind of following those existing teams had, Netball Australia made it clear the new teams should have the ability to bring in their own fanbases. This resulted in the granting of licences to the Sunshine Coast Lightning (owned by Melbourne Storm), Giants Netball (a partnership between Netball NSW and the GWS Giants) and the Collingwood Magpies. Related: Collingwood Super Netball team in danger of collapse From the outset, the Lightning enjoyed the benefit of being based in a location with no other professional sports team to call their own. The physical separation from the Storm provided the support and connection without unnecessary interference. The local community developed a sense of pride and belonging and the success of the team – winning the first two premierships of the new competition – only solidified their burgeoning fanbase. In Sydney, the Giants were able to take advantage of growing western Sydney support for their AFL team, while maintaining a connection to the grassroots through the partnership with Netball NSW. This provided access to local clubs and associations, with regular visits out to suburban netball competitions on weekends to drive fan engagement across codes. With the news that the Collingwood Magpies are reviewing their netball program, it is clear that things did not go so well for the competition’s third expansion team. Without its own unique location or a connection to grassroots, the challenges were there, but with the might of the Collingwood Football Club behind them, few believed they would fail. And yet, from an outsider’s perspective there appeared little effort from the start to bring football supporters across, to educate them about netball or to nurture a fanbase. Instead they assembled a team of stars, did not bring in a coach of the calibre to support those stars, and assumed success would follow and with success would come fans. It was the Field of Dreams model of success – if we build it, they will come. It seems now that little can be done to resurrect the Magpies. If the power of the Collingwood machine was not enough to carry the team when they entered the competition riding on a wave of hype, it is unlikely to now, when the team is languishing at the bottom of the ladder and struggling to bring enough fans through the door. It is heartbreaking for the players who have done all they can. Many have made their homes in Melbourne, worked to build a team culture, and to connect to fans through social media and at games. Magpies players line up. Photograph: Graham Denholm/Getty Images In a statement released on Monday, Netball Australia reiterated its commitment to an eight-team competition – a condition set by the broadcast deal with Fox Sports. This means that should Collingwood exit the league, a new team would need to take its place. The timing here is critical – with no collective player agreement (CPA) in place for 2024, all 80 Super Netball players will come off contract at the end of the current season. The Australian Netball Players’ Association has highlighted the start of the finals series on 24 June as their ideal date to have the new CPA signed to allow teams to begin contracting players. But the possible addition of a new team creates complications – the decisions around ownership and location will need to be made quickly to have staff in place to make contracting decisions. Related: Netball World Cup: safety first as Australia names surprise-free 19-player squad Tasmania has long been discussed as a location for a new team, but continuing to have a second Victorian team may be preferred. With the tight hold the Vixens have on Melbourne and the 2026 Commonwealth Games being hosted in regional Victoria, now may be the right time for a team to find its home in the regions and build a dedicated fanbase through connection to the local community – much as the Lightning have done for the past seven seasons. If a new team is to emerge in 2024, there are plenty of lessons to be taken from the demise of the Magpies. Connect to the local community and grassroots sport to nurture and educate new fans of the game. Create a club culture that transcends the playing group and encompasses the community as well. Recognise that fans are not a natural result of success, but a vital part of creating it. Do not build something and assume they will come, rather show them the plans, ask for input and build it together. Then they will not only come, but they will stay.</body>

    <head>The cancelled Quad summit is a win for China and a self-inflicted blow to the US’s Pacific standing</head>
    <body>The Chinese government is probably the biggest winner from Joe Biden’s decision to pull out of his trip to Australia and Papua New Guinea, forcing the cancellation of the Quad summit in Sydney. Chinese state media outlets won’t need to muster much creative energy to weave together some of Beijing’s preferred narratives: that the US is racked by increasingly severe domestic upheaval and is an unreliable partner, quick to leave allies high and dry. To make matters worse for the US’s standing in the region, Biden’s planned visit to PNG on Monday had been trumpeted as a clear statement of intent about his commitment to the Pacific amid growing competition for influence with China. Related: Quad summit cancelled after Joe Biden calls off trip to Australia “We even declared a national public holiday for Biden’s historic visit only to be thrown under the bus by the US,” wrote Martyn Namorong, a PNG blogger and political activist. “The US keeps shooting itself in the foot as it stumbles to maintain its grip in the region. China doesn’t have to deal with such internal squabbling.” Veteran US diplomats say the Australian and PNG governments will be particularly disappointed by Biden’s decision to head home after this weekend’s G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, to focus on resolving the high-stakes political standoff over the debt ceiling. “It will be seen in the region as a self-inflicted wound caused by political polarisation in Washington that does not reflect well on America’s reliability as a partner,” said Daniel Russel, a former US assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup For more than a week, there had been speculation Biden might curtail his planned travel to the region to negotiate a deal with Republicans in Congress to prevent the US defaulting on its debt. Such an outcome would see millions of workers go unpaid in the US, but would also have severe flow-on consequences for the global economy. But officials involved in the planning of the Quad summit – bringing together the leaders of the US, Japan, India and Australia – insisted on Friday that it was “full steam ahead”. They were certainly proceeding on the basis the US president would attend the event at the Sydney Opera House on 24 May with a very large entourage. Things looked even more secure on Tuesday, when the Australian government announced – in close coordination with the US – that Biden would arrive in Canberra the day before the Quad summit to deliver an address to a joint session of parliament. Separately, photographs were published in the media showing Marine One, the US president’s helicopter, had arrived in Sydney ready for use during the Australian leg of his travel. “I am pleased that President Biden is able to take up my invitation to address parliament,” the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in a statement issued on Tuesday night. He also declared the Quad summit would be “the largest, most significant gathering in Australia since we hosted the G20 a decade ago”. But by about 4.30am on Wednesday, Albanese’s phone had started ringing as officials lined up a call from the president. The pair spoke before 6am and Biden “apologised that he would now have to postpone this visit because of the unfolding difficulties he is facing in his negotiations with the US Congress”, Albanese said. After a few hours of further discussions about whether to proceed with the Sydney summit but with the US sending someone else in Biden’s place, Albanese announced the whole thing was off. Albanese – who was already planning to go to the G7 summit in Hiroshima as an invitee of the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida – said the four Quad leaders would be “attempting to get together over that period of time”. Related: Disappointment in Papua New Guinea after Biden cancels first visit by a US leader Everyone involved will publicly express understanding for Biden’s political difficulties – Albanese, for one, said he was “absolutely certain” that “the president certainly wishes that this wasn’t happening” – but the cancellation is undoubtedly a blow to the Australian hosts. Officials had spent months extensively planning the huge logistical and security operation; last October’s budget set aside $23m for the costs of hosting the summit. It’s too soon to leap to any longer-term conclusions about the future of the Quad, previously a low-key channel for coordination among Japan, India, Australia and the US that has been elevated in status to leader-level talks in the past couple of years. But given the Quad was meant, in part, to send a signal of unity of purpose at a time when an increasingly powerful China was challenging regional norms, that project appears to have suffered a temporary setback.</body>

    <head>A moment that changed me: a brutal attack ended my dreams of being a boxer – but I found a new passion</head>
    <body>At 16 I had my whole life planned out. I was a budding amateur boxer with bags of passion and talent. I was going to be a star. My dad was my coach. Our mission was to win the national youth championships, then conquer the Olympics, before turning professional and working together to capture a world title. But, in one night, this dream of ours was taken away. It was a Friday evening. Teenagers stood around the park chatting and drinking. I was taking a night off from training to ride my BMX. I remember rolling towards the grind rail, sliding down and landing well enough to earn a cheer from my mates. As I rolled around the back of the main ramp, I began to cycle hard, building up speed, but mid-jump I caught sight of something in the sky whistling its way right towards the spot where I was heading. Before I could react, a beer bottle had exploded in front of me, showering me in shards of broken glass. I hit the concrete hard and lay there bleeding. Next thing I knew, my mates were screaming obscenities from across the skate park, but louder than that was the sound of pounding footsteps. I turned just in time to see the first fist strike my face. I couldn’t tell you how many times I got hit during the six-on-one beat-down. But it was a lot. I remember thinking: “What have I done to deserve this?” and “Why isn’t anybody helping me out?” ‘I swapped punchbags and skipping ropes for scripts and rehearsal rooms’ … Oliver Sykes. Photograph: Dawn Kilner Then things went from bad to worse. One lad used his knee to pin down my right arm. He splayed my hand on the ground and held it there. Then he shouted at his mate to stamp on it. His friend obliged, repeatedly. Suddenly, as if by magic, it stopped. Groups of kids from across the park had come together to form a human shield – an example of real courage and solidarity for which I’ll be forever grateful. I staggered home with the help of my friends. It wasn’t until the following morning, when I looked in the bathroom mirror, that I realised my sporting dreams were over. My face looked like one big bruise. There was massive swelling around my eyes, a deep cut on the ridge of my nose and teeth marks on my chest. What’s more, I soon learned that my right hand was permanently damaged. I was overwhelmed with despair. Dad was single-handedly raising my three brothers, two sisters and me. He dropped everything to give me the support I needed Six years later, my counsellor set up a meeting with the lad who engineered the foot stomping. He told me that cocaine had had a big part to play that night, as had jealousy and toxic masculinity. You see, the local newspaper had run a feature about me representing Buxton Amateur Boxing Club at their annual show. These lads had seen it and decided to bring me down a peg or two. Well, they succeeded. I never boxed competitively again after the incident in the park – it killed my appetite for the sport. My dad was my rock. At the time, we were living in poverty in rural Derbyshire. He was single-handedly raising my three brothers, two sisters and me. As challenging as that sounds, Dad dropped everything to give me the support I needed. Ultimately, he advised me to focus on my education. Though boxing had been my main obsession, followed closely by BMX-ing, I was also involved in theatre, having played several bit parts in school plays (usually, the small funny guy) and a couple of larger roles with Chapel Players, the local amateur dramatics club. Dad and I still loved boxing and we would often spend evenings watching reruns of old shows. I remember being absolutely in awe of Muhammad Ali: he was so funny, eccentric and theatrical. He was a performer too, so the idea of switching to the theatre never felt daunting to me – I’d still be dancing under those lights in rooms full of people, only this time nobody would be trying to punch me in the face. So, I swapped punchbags and skipping ropes for scripts and rehearsal rooms, and I relished the thrill of performing in front of a live audience. Theatre soon became my biggest passion and it has remained this way through college, university (where I graduated with a first-class honours degree in theatre studies) and into the world of work. Now, looking back on my 10 years in the arts, I wonder whether being assaulted in that park all those years ago was meant to be, because being involved in theatre has enabled me to do so much that sport couldn’t. For instance, at the core of my work as a producer and an artist, I have been helping young people from low-income backgrounds to access the arts – whether through creating work experience opportunities, mentoring, or producing the work of artists whose voices are underrepresented. Related: Julie Hesmondhalgh: ‘I wasn’t aware of class until I went to drama school in London’ Not only that, but the sport has found its way back to me. I’m currently touring a stage adaptation of my debut children’s book, Alfie’s First Fight. The story revolves around a child boxer being raised by his dad, who fights for his family and triumphs against all the odds. It’s amazing to think that I can provide children with inspiring stories that draw on my own experiences. Sometimes life throws you a curveball. Your dreams can disappear. Your ambitions can slip through your fingers. But I’ve learned that it’s how we respond that counts. In the face of adversity, you must never give up – you must forge new paths, dream new dreams and find what makes you happy. Oliver Sykes’ production of Alfie’s First Fight is touring nationally until October</body>

    <head>How mifepristone became a target of the US anti-abortion movement</head>
    <body>The future of mifepristone, a crucial abortion drug, is currently under question as US courts consider a challenge brought by anti-abortion groups. Considering medication is the most common US abortion method, it is the most significant reproductive rights case to make its way through the courts since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. The groups suing the Food and Drug Administration over its approval of the drug claim that the drug poses a threat to women and girls – contrary to scientific consensus – and should never have been approved by the FDA more than two decades ago. The FDA vehemently stands by its approval of the pill, with the Biden administration emphasizing the agency’s rigorous safety reviews of the drug. So what’s the story of the drug, and how did we get here? The history of mifepristone – a global perspective In 1980, mifepristone was invented by French drug company Roussel Uclaf and was approved for market use in France in 1988. After its approval, following threats of boycotts and violence by US anti-abortion groups, Roussel Uclaf decided to suspend distribution of mifepristone for two days before the French government stepped in, ordering the drug back on the market. “From the moment governmental approval for the drug was granted, RU-486 became the moral property of women,” said France’s then health minister Claude Evin in reference to mifepristone, shutting down anti-abortion groups’ protest. The UK and China followed France in approving mifepristone in 1991 and Sweden’s 1992 approval came quickly after. But while the Clinton administration had high hopes of also quickly approving mifepristone, the same pattern did not emerge in the US.

One of those orders directed the health secretary to review an import ban that had been imposed on the drug, to determine whether it had any basis. “It is time to learn the truth about what the health and safety risks of the drug really are,” Clinton said. On that day, he was met by about 75,000 anti-abortion protestors, angered by the change of direction after years of anti-abortion policies during the Reagan years. It was a harbinger of times to come: a fraught, seven-year battle for approval, putting the US behind many of its European counterparts in the approval of a potentially life-saving drug. In 1996, the FDA met for the first time to consider the drug’s approval. Concerned about the potential for violence, officials held the meeting under strict security requirements, using metal detectors and a rigid travel itinerary to keep violence at bay. Those attending the meeting were to be bussed in from a nearby hotel, and only camera crews were allowed to wait outside the meeting in the parking lot. Fierce anti-abortion backlash continued, and the FDA continued to review evidence on the drug’s safety, while the rest of the world continued to move ahead in approving it. By 1999, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Israel, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, and Ukraine had all approved mifepristone. Interactive In 2000, mifepristone was finally approved in the US, for terminations through seven weeks of pregnancy. That time period was later extended, to 10 weeks of pregnancy in 2016. Until 2021, mifepristone could only be dispensed in clinics, medical offices and hospitals – even though countries such as Canada and Australia had begun lifting those kinds of restrictions years prior. With lockdowns in place across the world, the US finally began reconsidering its dispensing restrictions in 2020 during the Covid pandemic. By April 2021, in response to mounting pressure, the FDA temporarily lifted its restrictions on mifepristone, allowing it to be sent in the mail. Those changes became permanent in December 2021. In 2023, the FDA announced that pharmacies could become certified to dispense mifepristone, lifting the strict requirements on who can dispense it. The fifth circuit court of appeals, which is currently considering the future of mifepristone in the US, in April invalidated all of the FDA’s post-2016 actions to loosen restrictions on the drug. The supreme court temporarily blocked that decision, and mifepristone currently remains available in pharmacies and through the mail as the case proceeds. Are abortion drugs safe? The plaintiffs challenging the approval of mifepristone have claimed the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone has put the safety of women and girls at risk.

Photograph: Manoocher Deghati/AFP/Getty Images In reality, years of research on tens of thousands of women has shown it to be safe and effective. Many point out that mifepristone is safer than Tylenol and Viagra, and have lambasted remaining restrictions on the drug in the US, even at a time when it is listed as an essential medicine by the World Health Organization. Interactive Meta-analyses within the last decade, on almost 270,000 people using the drug through nine weeks of pregnancy, have consistently shown a less than 1% rate of serious complications associated with use of the drug (such as an infection, or need for a blood transfusion). Only two deaths have been reported in that subsample – one caused by pneumonia, and one from an ectopic pregnancy – both of which are listed as likely not the result of taking medication abortion pills. The rise in use Medication abortion only recently became the most common abortion method in the US. The most recent comprehensive data, from 2020, suggests that 53% of US abortions could be attributed to medication (both misoprostol and mifepristone used together). But that number does not account for any likely increase in usage after the FDA’s 2021 decision to expand access to the pill by mail, nor from the likely increase in pills being acquired from the internet – including from overseas – since Roe v Wade was overturned. Demonstrators in New York protest a decision to overrule the FDA approval of mifepristone on 15 April. Photograph: Olga Fedorova/SOPA Images/Shutterstock Interactive Prior to 2017, the incidence of medication abortion was far lower: around 39% of all US abortions in 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 31% in 2014; 23% in 2011, 17% in 2008, 6% in 2005 and 6% in 2001. With abortion banned in more than a dozen states since Roe v Wade fell, the number of legal abortions in the US has been reported to have fallen by 6%. However, the increase in people ordering pills online may be significantly mitigating that drop. It may be this impact, in offsetting the effect of abortion bans, that is fueling the rightwing push against the pills.</body>

    <head>I left my party lifestyle behind for a week in a nunnery – and began to see the light</head>
    <body>For me, a standard day off on a Saturday would consist of an overpriced brunch, mooching around the shops with my friends, bingeing Netflix and eating a large, carb-infused dinner in order to line my stomach for an evening of partying until the early hours. As a 28-year-old, my life has often revolved around relationships, sex, work, drinking, money, partying and looking good. Even reading the list as I type, I feel guilty and almost embarrassed about my self-indulgence. I’ve always wondered what life would be like without modern-day pleasures and pressures. So one Saturday morning three months ago, I caught the train from London to Ramsgate on the Kent coast in order to be welcomed into the guest house of a group of 11 Benedictine nuns for a week. I had decided to swap my lifestyle for theirs, and to see what would happen if I gave myself fully to a world where your only relationships are with a higher being, and with your sisterhood. Could having less, and focusing on simpler things, actually make me feel more satisfied? Although my mum was taught by Benedictine nuns at school, I wasn’t brought up to follow a religion. She has many terrifying stories of getting the cane for no reason and was left with plenty of Catholic guilt. She was, perhaps understandably, nervous about me going to stay with the nuns. As I wheeled my (admittedly big) suitcase up to Minster Abbey, I was met by Mother Nikola. She has been at the abbey for 40 years and joined the convent when she was my age. Benedictine nuns are defined by the vows they take: obedience, stability and conversatio morum (sometimes translated as “fidelity to monastic life”). They promise to remain in the community for life, commit to chastity, and live for God, not themselves. All money and possessions are surrendered on arrival, and the community lives on joint funds. I was shown to my room. Brown, 1960s-style floral bedding lay on the single bed; a crucifix and a portrait of a nun hung on the wall (there was no mirror); and a Bible was left in the drawer. A prayer schedule was tacked to the back of the door: 5.30am, 8.30am, 9am, 12.15pm, 5.30pm, 6pm and 7.45pm. As someone who struggles with structure and routine – I’ve never been able to have a full-time office job – I quickly became overwhelmed by the rigid timetable. I found the first three days unbelievably hard – and felt ashamed for feeling that way. The early mornings, not being able to talk to anyone, and the lack of wifi made me anxious that I might be missing out on work or other “important” things. Why I’d brought so many clothes with me, I don’t know. I spent the whole day either in prayer or in solitary contemplation. My struggles were mirroring what I needed to work on in everyday life – so I tried to sit with the discomfort and adjust to the discipline. The lack of mirrors became a positive thing: I began to eradicate the urge to check myself in passing. “Love your enemy,” said Mother Nikola while reading a chapter during prayers on my third day at the abbey. Not much had resonated with me before that. But loving my enemy is something I’ve often struggled to do. I have a tendency to hang on to the past, which has made me stubborn and sometimes bitter. I haven’t spoken to some people I’ve fallen out with for more than 10 years: the ability to forgive is what I need to learn in order to move forward in my life. For the first time, something really clicked; over the next few days, I felt a shift in my learning. Even the structure started to feel easier. Sister Benedict joined Minster Abbey in 1975 and she, too, found the monastic life difficult at first. At the age of 14, she’d had “a powerful experience of God”, which she now understands was her calling to the abbey. After leaving school she went into social work, but soon found herself, at 22, joining the abbey. Her ongoing doubts, however, meant that she had to retake her vows of commitment after several years. “If it’s not hard, it’s probably not right,” she says. “For a lot of women, the thought of joining us might be as an escape from the pressures of life, but what’s the point? Joining a nunnery is supposed to be a sacrifice, not easy.” This was exactly what I needed to hear. I went back to my room and looked at my open suitcase, filled with 11 days’ worth of clothes for a seven-day trip, and my five-step skincare routine laid out on the desk. I realised how much I use things such as films, podcasts and Instagram as distractions because I don’t particularly like sitting with myself or with my thoughts for too long. As I reflected, I realised that yes, even though I want these things, I don’t actually need them; and quite often I use them to mask deeper problems and insecurities. As I made my way back home after seven days, I contemplated how much I really give back to the community – and reflected on the difference between wanting and needing something. I realised that I am a master of procrastination and actually, could do with a little more structure. I rely on tech, money and chatting to friends as tools to escape being on my own – and to mask deeper emotions. As I approach 30, this experience has really helped me to shift my focus and prioritise being more present. My stay at the abbey might just have been the path to contentment I didn’t realise I needed so much.

    <head>Nam June Paik: Moon Is the Oldest TV review – the adventures of a multimedia maverick</head>
    <body>Nam June Paik was a Korean video art pioneer, experimentalist and avant garde disruptor whose amazing, anarchic career – which flourished in 1960s and 70s New York – is recounted in this amusing and engaging documentary, the title of which is taken from one of his works: a luminous disc on a screen, telling us we gaze at the TV in the submissive way we once stared at the moon. Minari’s Steven Yeun provides the voiceover for the artist’s own words and, among other things, this film shows us how exhausting it must be to do what he did: to insist, for decades, that his art, an art which bore no resemblance to anything that had gone before, had validity and meaning, while always being on the verge of poverty and physical breakdown. The overwhelming sense of vocation necessary for such a life is almost awe-inspiring, although Paik’s own jokey, opaque persona seems to exist as a rebuke to any reaction as bourgeois as that. Paik was a music student and pianist, radicalised by his period in 1950s West Germany during which he encountered Schönberg, Stockhausen and especially John Cage, who became a lifelong ally. Cage has a droll remark about Paik’s wacky, confrontational concerts and happenings: “More entertaining to recall than to experience at the time.” A Cageian movement in his own work led away from music to an interest in soundscape design, radio and TV and finally video art; Paik was the early adopter who saw video’s potential. Paik’s work also involved the manipulation of TV images, an artistic “talking back” to the TV, and there is a sense that he foresaw the whole of the internet and Web 2.0: his 1974 work Electronic Superhighway arguably anticipated the phrase “information superhighway”. He was a kind of Warhol figure (or even Godardian figure) in his fascination with the image: a very modern creator. • Nam June Paik: Moon Is the Oldest TV is released on 19 May in UK and Irish cinemas, with an Australia release to be confirmed.</body>

    <head>New York law aims to stop funding of illegal Israeli settlements in West Bank</head>
    <body>New York’s state assembly is to consider legislation to stop registered charities from sending tens of millions of dollars a year to fund illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. State assembly member, Zohran Mamdani, has introduced the “Not on our dime!: Ending New York funding of Israeli settler violence” act to prohibit tax-deductible donations from being used to expel Palestinians from their land and other activities widely regarded as war crimes under the Geneva conventions. The United Nations security council has called Israeli settlement construction “a flagrant violation under international law”. “This legislation makes it clear that New York will no longer effectively subsidise war crimes and the flouting of international law,” Mamdani told the Guardian. “What we have is a number of New York state-registered charities that are sending at least $60m a year to Israeli settlement organisations which then use that funding to continue the history of expulsion and dispossession of Palestinians in the occupied territories that has been going on for decades.” The bill was denounced by some other members of the legislature who characterised it as an attack on charities that provide care for victims of terrorism and clothe orphans. “The bill is a ploy to demonise Jewish charities with connection to Israel. It was only introduced to antagonise pro-Israel New Yorkers and sow divisions within the Democratic party,” they said in a statement that did not make mention of settlements. The legislation is backed by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights and Jewish Voice for Peace among others. Vince Warren, CCR’s director, said: “Aiding and abetting war crimes is not charitable, period. This bill goes a long way toward ensuring that New York is not inadvertently subsidising war crimes, but rather creating paths for accountability.” Mamdani named several New York-based organisations as targets for the law including the Central Fund of Israel which describes itself as “promoting charitable causes in Israel”. CFI makes specific mention of its money going to the “land of Israel” which is often used to refer to the occupied territories as well as the state of Israel. The CFI disperses donations to an array of settler organisations including the Israel Land Fund responsible for the expulsion of Palestinian families from their homes to make way for Jewish settlers. Another US group, Friends of Ir David, funds Elad, an Israeli settler organisation responsible for the forced removal of Palestinians as it seeks to “Judaise” occupied East Jerusalem. “These organisations masquerade as charities while funding illegal activities,” said Mamdani. In 2015, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz revealed that at least 50 organisations across the US were involved in fundraising for Israeli settlements. Haaretz said some of the money also went “toward providing legal aid to Jews accused or convicted of terrorism, and supporting their families” through a “legal aid society” called Honenu. “Among those who benefited from the group’s support in 2013 were the family of Ami Popper, who murdered seven Palestinian laborers in 1990, and members of the Bat Ayin Underground, which attempted to detonate a bomb at a girls’ school in East Jerusalem in 2002,” Haaretz reported. The proposed legislation would give New York state’s attorney general the power to sue groups funding settlements. It would also give Palestinians harmed by settler organisations funded by New York-based charities the right to seek damages in American courts. Mamdani said that explicit legislation is necessary because, while there may be other laws on the books that could be used to prevent Americans funding illegal activities abroad, the politics of support for Israel in the US means they have not been applied. “There’s a phrase that I grew up hearing: PEP, progressive except Palestine. You’d see how time and again how politicians who espoused universal beliefs would always seem to find an exception when it came to the question of Israel and Palestine. We see that sadly in terms of how our laws are applied in terms of how our policies are applied. What this legislation does is it reckons with reality,” he said. For that reason, Mamdani acknowledges he will struggle to get the law passed at this time. But he said successive US presidents have opposed settlement expansion and public opinion is increasingly shifting toward support for the Palestinians. “I think it will be a long fight. I do not have any illusions. But if you look at the attitudes of Americans towards Palestine and towards Israel, and specifically to the question of settlements, it is very clear that this is also a fight that is broadly popular,” he said. The Central Fund of Israel and Friends of Ir David have been asked for comment.</body>

    <head>Framework Laptop 13 review: cracking modular PC gets all-round upgrade</head>
    <body>The fixable and upgradeable premium Framework Laptop 13 has been improved all round for 2023 and is packed with small changes that are backwards compatible with older models, making a great laptop even better. The original Framework broke new ground last year as a laptop designed to be taken apart and upgraded, and with a modular selection of ports, too. Crucially, the company followed through on promises to provide parts and upgrades for existing machines – first with 12th-gen Intel chips and now new 13th-gen Intel processors, with AMD Ryzen 7040 series chip options coming later this year. DIY versions start at £849, where you install your own RAM, storage and operating system. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian But for those who don’t already have a Framework 13 sitting on their desks, these improved parts have been rolled into new pre-built options, with Windows 11 starting at £1,049 ($1,049). Physically, little has changed, so that the new parts are compatible with older machines. The laptop is thin, light and made of recycled aluminium. It looks and feels premium. The screen is the same crisp and bright panel as before, but now has a matt rather than gloss coating, which significantly reduces glare and reflections. The new, more robust-feeling screen hinges still open to a full 180 degrees, which is very handy for using the laptop in a stand. The keyboard is good, with plenty of key travel for a satisfying typing experience, while the large glass trackpad is smooth and precise. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The laptop has new, louder stereo speakers, which are still fairly tinny compared with the best, but fine for watching YouTube or taking meetings. A good 1080p webcam is at the top of the screen, with a physical switch for privacy. If you don’t like the black screen bezel, you can swap it for various colours, too. Specifications Screen: 13.5in LCD 2256 x 1504 (60Hz; 201 PPI) Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7 (13th generation) RAM: 8, 16, 32 or 64GB Storage: 256, 512GB, 1, 2 or 4TB Operating system: Windows 11 Home or Pro Camera: 1080p front-facing Connectivity: wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, headphones, fingerprint scanner + choice of 4 ports: USB-C (USB4/Thunderbolt 4), USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, ethernet, microSD Dimensions: 296.6 x 229.0 x 15.9mm Weight: 1.3kg Ports and power Press the button on the bottom of the laptop to unlock the module and swap the port to whichever variation you need. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian The Laptop 13’s modular ports are still a great idea. Choose between any combination of USB-4/Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, ethernet, microSD and expandable storage drives, and swap them as you need. With most costing less than £20 each, they are cheap enough to keep a collection for different tasks. The 13th-gen Intel Core i7, as tested in the “performance” version of the laptop with 16GB of RAM, was all round an improvement on the 11th-gen chips tested last year. It was certainly fast enough to handle any general computing task, keeping up with rivals for power. It won’t handle high-end gaming, but managed a bit of Command &amp; Conquer Remastered and various other older or lighter titles just fine. It also ran a lot cooler than the previous version, with the fans generally staying silent while browsing and general computing, which was most welcome. Framework also released a higher-capacity battery that stores 11% more energy in the same physical size and ships in all but the cheapest models. It still won’t win any longevity awards, but the laptop managed a good eight to nine hours of productivity work in Chrome, Windows Mail, Evernote and various other light apps. That is at least an hour longer than the previous version. Sustainability There’s a permanent headphones socket in the side of the laptop, while the rest of the ports are swappable. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian Framework rates the battery to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for at least 1,000 full charge cycles. It can easily be replaced along with all the rest of the components, including the RAM and SSD. The first-gen laptop was awarded 10 out of 10 for repairability and the 2023 model praised by the specialists iFixit for its ease of upgrade. Framework sells replacement parts and upgrades through its marketplace, but also supports third-party parts. The laptop contains recycled aluminium and plastic in most components. Price The Framework Laptop 13 is available as a pre-built, ready-to-use machine or in a DIY edition. Pre-built “base” machines with Windows 11, an Intel Core i5-1340P, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage start at £1,049 ($1,049). The performance model as tested with an i7-1360P costs £1,469 ($1,469) with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. DIY editions start at £849. For comparison, the Dell XPS 13 Plus starts at £1,348.99, the Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 starts at £999 and the Apple MacBook Air M2 starts at £1,249 Verdict Framework has delivered on its promise of upgrades for its existing machines which, when put together, create a more refined machine in the Laptop 13. The 13th-gen Intel chips run cooler, helping the laptop to stay quieter and offering plenty of performance. But the other refinements to the hinges, speakers, battery and screen improve the experience just as much. The swappable ports remain an excellent idea. The battery life is still far short of the best in the business, but is now long enough for a work day. A touchscreen would be nice but isn’t essential. And you can certainly get better-looking mainstream rivals. But the 2023 Framework Laptop 13 is an excellent, adaptable and upgradable marvel suitable for more than just PC enthusiasts. Pros: swappable ports, repairable and upgradeable design, great performance, decent battery life, contains recycled aluminium and plastic, well-made, good fingerprint scanner, good screen, great webcam, good keyboard and trackpad. Cons: no touchscreen, lid a little flimsier than the rest of the body, short availability, with wait time for purchasing new machines. The aluminium lid looks and feels great, but is slightly more flexible than some premium rivals. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</body>

    <body>If you want to see the full range of expression of which a Swede is capable, just mention Ikea. Annoyance, amusement, pride and resentment flit across Terese Alstin’s face as she forms a response. “It’s a love-hate relationship,” she says finally, laughing. We’re tucking into an exquisite lunch of chicken and asparagus at the Mat- &amp; Chokladstudion cafe in Malmö. Sweden’s third-largest city is renowned for its independent design scene – with boutiques and design-forward restaurants that are open year round – but right now, just before the third Southern Sweden Design Days (SSDD), there’s an almost audible crackle of creative energy in the air. Terese is strategic manager at the Form/Design Center, the organisation behind the event, which takes place on 25-28 May. More than 60 venues across Malmö will be involved, turning the city into a sprawling design museum, with exhibitions, pop-up shops and talks. About 85% of participants are one-person companies. Furniture from Malmö Upcycling Service. Photograph: Malin Falk The theme for 2023 is “Dissonance”, appropriate for a festival that appears to pit designer Davids against Ikea’s Goliath. And yet – in the Swedish spirit of inclusivity – Ikea, too, will be part of the festival, hosting a seminar on the role of dissonance in design. “They are a part of Swedish design, but we wouldn’t want them to become an official sponsor,” says Terese. “I feel it’s my responsibility to change the perception of what Swedish design is about.” Terese and I grab coffee and kanelbullar (cinnamon buns) and go to meet designer Anna Gudmundsdottir for a spot of fika: the twice-daily social coffee breaks built into the fabric of Swedish society. Pastries are mandatory. We step into Anna’s “hoarder’s studio” (her words). Against one wall, old shop display parts and pipes are locked in a complex embrace – pull one out, I think, and the whole lot would tumble. On her desk is a clutter of Carrara marble offcuts, which she tells me would have been ground up and used in asphalt if she hadn’t saved them. Peer behind the massive brands and you will find the grassroots growing, sprouting multicoloured flowers Lately, Anna has channelled her hoarding tendencies into founding the Malmö Upcycling Service, which supplies leftover materials to designers. She shows me examples of her recent works: a lamp made from ventilation tubes, a cabinet made from leftover shipbuilding vinyl. I wouldn’t know they were upcycled if Anna hadn’t told me. “It doesn’t have to look like waste,” she says. “It’s not waste – it’s a resource.” Anna’s designs are available in the Form/Design Center shop – and during SSDD she, along with many others, will be exhibiting at BISe, a quintessentially Scandi restaurant that’s all clean-lined chairs and rippling glassware. At dinner that evening, the interiors are upstaged only by the creative clashes on my plate: pairings such as halibut and passionfruit, rhubarb and cardamom. I brace myself for a Stockholm-style bill, but the three-course meal, as with most things in Malmö, is surprisingly reasonably priced at 600kr (£46), excluding drinks. Quintessentially Scandi … BISe restaurant Photograph: PR It’s much-needed fuel for a whirl through Malmö’s designer boutiques: hand-thrown pots at AB Småland, Technicolor homeware at Designtorget, and frilly dresses at Beyond Us, where decor and merchandise are as pink as the cherry blossom trees lining Malmö’s canals. While dodging bicycles, I marvel at the juxtaposition of cobbled streets and modern buildings with glittering glass facades that shift and dance in the sun. I come to rest at Mitt Möllan, another SSDD venue, which was once a dated shopping mall; now, it’s an incubator for fledgling design businesses. “We meet them when they’re green and they’re here with their mums,” says Kajsa Blum, Mitt Möllan’s brand strategist. Any business is welcome, as long as it meets Mitt Möllan’s criteria for sustainability and locally made goods. I peer into Ateljé Laga, where Mexican designer Verónica Luna is stitching floral fabric scraps on to a handbag. Customers bring their old garments to Verónica; she redesigns them with embroidery and lace before handing them back. She’s currently working on a denim line with Phoenix and Friends, a secondhand clothing store across the corridor. As pink as Malmö’s cherry blossom trees … Beyond Us Photograph: PR The variety here is dazzling. Stepping across the mall’s faux terrazzo floors, I encounter huge, crepe-paper flowers in the window of Pill &amp; Punch, and a Song-o-matic recording booth where visitors record anonymous confessions, to be transformed into whispering works of sound art by the Finnish musician Elee Loop. On seeing a wall of posters by the Malmö-based graphic artist Magoz, I pause then realise where I’ve seen his work – in publications across the world, from Wired to the New York Times. When you have accessibility to art and an affordable city to live in, you have time to create Selma Modéer Wiking It’s all so unlike the Swedish design I thought I knew. Peer behind the massive, monolithic brands and you will find the grassroots growing, sprouting multicoloured flowers – if only people would bother to look. In the 19th-century Folkets Park, Terese and I stroll by a pastel menagerie of bicycle-sized bumblebees and water-lily fountains. Malmö’s designers collaborated on Folkets’ playgrounds: I hear delighted shrieks and turn to see children scaling what looks like a space shuttle. Other playgrounds are inspired by safaris and fairytales. There’s not a flat-pack Lack table in sight. Our final stop is the Cowgirl Gallery. Founder Selma Modéer Wiking shakes my hand with a firm grip, then hands me a bottle of kombucha from the Malmö-based company Gaëlle. The Cowgirl Gallery Photograph: PR Selma was planning a move to Berlin when she walked past the then-vacant space in which we now sit. On impulse, she decided to stay in Malmö instead, and set up Cowgirl – a cafe, gallery, co-working space, performance space, cinema and boutique. “I want to have everything I love: good coffee, a new exhibition every month, poetry, live music,” she says, talking rapidly. Backed by government funding, Selma has seemingly limitless agency; the gallery changes according to her whims. “I used to have ceramics here, but it’s so trendy,” she says, rolling her eyes. “I want to sell magazines you can’t find anywhere else, and posters – posters are the most democratic form of art.” She pauses for a sip of kombucha. Behind tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, her eyes dart about the space – I can tell that she is already visualising next month’s exhibition. “When you have accessibility to art and an affordable city to live in, you have time to create,” she says. “It is an extreme luxury to live in a country where you can be odd.” The trip was provided by Form/Design Center and Visit Sweden, with accommodation at MJ’s Hotel (doubles from £86 room only)</body>

    <head>A US company is trying to trademark the shape of its lettuce – but this is just the tip of the iceberg</head>
    <body>Hannah Gadsby, a feted, award-winning comedian, has curated an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, about Pablo Picasso’s complicated legacy, called It’s Pablo-matic. This has absolutely nothing to do with the subject at hand – which is lettuce. Rather, I am alerting you to the exhibition because it’s proof that terrible puns are now high art. Bear this in mind as I proceed to make as many terrible leaf puns as I can in the next few paragraphs. OK, lettuce get back to the point. A US company called Little Leaf Farms is trying to trademark the curvy shape of its baby crispy green leaf lettuce. Is this some kind of GM-nightmare leaf, you might be wondering? Has big lettuce deviously planted cells in order to create a super-curvy salad? I wouldn’t rule it out, but in this instance it seems the lettuce’s shape is natural and the result of a particular seed being grown in a way that results in ruffled edges. Can you trademark that? US trademark experts seem to think it’s a long shot, but possible. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, isn’t it? Please romaine calm, but we live in a world where absolutely anything can be commoditised, monetised, trademarked and privatised. If you make a joke on the internet and it goes viral, for example, it’s almost guaranteed that someone will try to profit from it. Just ask Dan Atkinson, who coined a (little) gem of a pun, “Wagatha Christie”, and then, three years later, discovered that Rebekah Vardy had trademarked the phrase so that, if she feels like it, she can slap it on a line of branded meat tenderisers. While that sounds brazen, it’s nothing compared with the musician Drake, who trademarked “God’s Plan”, the title of one of his songs and a commonplace phrase, so that he could put it on cardigans. Nothing is sacred these days, not even salad. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</body>

    <head>Preventing millions of hepatitis deaths is a ‘thundering moral imperative’</head>
    <body>The world faces “a thundering moral imperative” to prevent people in poor countries dying of viral hepatitis when the cost of treating them is “less than dinner for two”, the pharmaceutical industry and health donors will be told on Wednesday. In a passionate appeal to the international community to avoid repeating the mistakes made early in the HIV and Aids crisis, delegates meeting in Geneva at the first international pledging conference for viral hepatitis will be urged to give $150m (£120m) to ensure that low-cost treatment reaches those who need it. Dr Michel Kazatchkine, the veteran HIV/Aids advocate, will say: “For those of us who have engaged in the fight against HIV and tuberculosis for decades, this sounds familiar. This lack of political and financial commitment is typical for a disease that disproportionally affects the poorest and the most vulnerable. “And this lack of concern is deadly. It leads to millions of unnecessary deaths.” Michel Kazatchkine is the former UN special envoy for HIV and Aids and the ex-director of the Global Fund. Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images More than 350 million people live with a chronic viral hepatitis infection, with more than 1.1 million deaths each year, predominantly in low and middle-income countries. Experts estimate that if the current trajectory continues, viral hepatitis will kill more people annually than malaria, tuberculosis and Aids combined by 2040. Comparatively low-cost diagnostic tools and generic drugs – as well as a highly effective vaccine – already exist. But there is a lack of funds to get them to the places most in need and, when the cost of treating someone with hepatitis C is as little as $80 (£64) a patient, this is “unforgivable”, according to Kazatchkine. “We have been here before: while cost should not be an obstacle to saving a life, we have seen again and again that it is,” he will say. “But when treatment is this affordable, we face a thundering moral imperative to act. Letting someone die or passing on their infection to their children is unforgivable when the diagnosis and treatment cost less than a dinner for two here in Geneva.” Kazatchkine, the former UN special envoy for HIV and Aids and the ex-director of the Global Fund, has spent decades advocating for more investment in treating Aids, tuberculosis and malaria. But he believes it is “more than absurd” for donors to spend tens of billions on those diseases, “only to see patients die from another easily preventable and treatable disease and frequent co-infection”. In 2016 World Health Organization member states committed to reducing deaths from viral hepatitis by 65% by 2030. Some countries, such as Egypt, Rwanda and Mongolia, are making good progress, but overall the world is off target. According to WHO data, fewer than one in five newborns in Africa receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, which is essential because mother-to-child transmission is the primary way the infection is passed on. Related: Pneumonia vaccine delays kill thousands needlessly in Africa Before Covid-19, Gavi, the vaccine alliance, committed to supporting a rollout of hepatitis B birth vaccines, but in 2020 announced it had delayed implementation due to disruption caused by the pandemic. Millions of people with chronic hepatitis C infection – which is spread through contact with blood from an infected person and can lead to fatal liver complications such as cancer and cirrhosis – are also yet to see the benefit of scientific breakthroughs. Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of cases, but reach just 13% of diagnosed people. Today’s hepatitis resource mobilisation conference will be hosted by Egypt and Saudi Arabia, alongside the Hepatitis Fund and the Clinton Health Access Initiative.</body>

    <head>Thames Water has failed us for four months after a flood</head>
    <body>Four months ago, a water pipe burst in our street and flooded the bathroom in our lower-ground-floor flat. The damage forced us to move out and we are still waiting for Thames Water and its insurer for a repair. When the burst pipe was discovered, the mains water was not shut off and it was five days before engineers came. By then, water had flooded a large area of the street and leaked through the light fittings in our bathroom. A dehumidifier made little difference and, three weeks later, we were moved into an apart-hotel while builders stripped the bathroom. That was two months ago and no one has returned since. In the meantime, our landlord commissioned a survey, which recommended a programme of works, but repeated calls to Thames and its insurer have been ineffective. I suffered a miscarriage shortly after the flood, and believe severe stress was a factor. I am now seven weeks pregnant, and we are desperate to return home. Our 81-year-old landlord also had his health affected by the worry. AH, London Your log of interactions shows numerous calls and emails, most of which were either ignored, or asked you to wait for an update. Nonetheless, Thames Water claims it has been in “regular contact” and was unaware of your pregnancies. The most effective contact appears to have happened after I waded in. Contractors were appointed and you were told the work would take three weeks. You moved back four weeks later. The company says initial delays were due to the complexity of the repair and council bureaucracy, and the water supply could not be shut off because of vulnerable residents in the street. The delays in repairing your flat, or confirming a timescale were, it says, because of the time it took to dry out. That doesn’t explain a month-long lapse between it declaring the bathroom dry and scheduling remedial works. Thames Water has agreed to pay £3,500 for the four months of rent you had to fork out on an uninhabitable flat. Customers with problems should follow the company’s official complaints procedure on its website. If there is no satisfactory resolution, they can ask the Consumer Council for Water to intervene.

    <head>Wednesday briefing: Are standardised tests failing children?</head>
    <body>Good morning. Almost everything about adulthood stinks, but it has one important benefit: nobody can ever make you take another exam. Who among us looks back fondly on turning over a sheaf of paper to find out which particular gaps in your knowledge are about to be ruthlessly exposed? And who doesn’t feel a shiver of sympathy for the children going through the same thing today – and gratitude that at least this time, it isn’t you? Year 6 pupils in England, who sat their key stage 2 tests (widely known as Sats, or standardised assessment tests) last week, might be justified in feeling particularly hard done by: they face far more onerous assessment than their counterparts across the rest of the UK, and can look to 10 and 11-year-olds in comparable systems from Canada to New Zealand for proof that another approach is possible. In the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, and after the alarm was raised over a particularly brutal English test last week that was said to have left some pupils in tears, those worries look particularly salient. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s education correspondent Sally Weale, is about the long-running fight over Sats, and why so many teachers and parents are calling for an overhaul. You may now look at the headlines. You have five minutes to complete this newsletter. Do not use a calculator. Five big stories Housing | Tenants and campaigners have warned Michael Gove not to create a “back door” for unfair evictions as private rented sector reforms are unveiled on Wednesday. The overhaul will ban no-fault evictions but strengthen landlords’ rights to throw tenants out for antisocial behaviour, which could mean renters being given a two-week notice period for antisocial behaviour evictions. Taiwan | Free nations must commit themselves to a free Taiwan, Liz Truss has said on a visit to Taipei, in which she called for an “economic Nato” to tackle Beijing’s growing authoritarianism. Truss, the most senior British politician to make the trip since Margaret Thatcher, drew a rebuke from China’s UK embassy, which said the visit would only harm Britain. Media | A leading Mirror journalist allegedly blackmailed the company as it attempted to cover up phone hacking, the high court has been told. Lee Harpin, who held a number of senior roles at the People and Sunday Mirror, was alleged to be a known phone hacker whose understanding of illegal behaviour at the newspaper group caused anxiety at board level. Harpin denies the claims. Asylum | Ministers are removing basic housing protections from asylum seekers under new rules designed to move tens of thousands out of hotels and into the private rented sector. The changes would exempt landlords from regulations governing everything from electrical safety to minimum room sizes. Education | The University of Oxford will cut its ties with the Sackler family, whose wealth came from addictive opioid drugs. The family’s name will be removed from two galleries in the Ashmolean Museum and a university library as well as several staff positions. In depth: ‘There is real worry that disadvantaged students will find it very difficult to catch up’ Dismay about the difficulty of Sats is now as predictable a part of the academic calendar as a terrible school play – but it feels especially acute this year. Last year’s results revealed the gap between the scores obtained by disadvantaged children and others had grown since before the pandemic, when they were last taken, leaving the biggest difference between the two in a decade. And after the Department for Education responded to anger over an English test last week, reported to be so hard that some teachers struggled to understand the questions, by saying that it was “designed to be challenging”, schools minister Nick Gibb promised to review the paper in question. “They do have to test a range of ability to make sure we can show what proportion of children are exceeding the standards and so on,” he said. “But we don’t want these tests to be too hard for children. That’s not the purpose.” So what is the purpose? “The government would say that up until the pandemic, taking a rigorous approach has in general narrowed the gap between disadvantaged children and their wealthier peers,” Sally Weale said. “But that approach has stalled. And there is real worry that they will find it very difficult to catch up.” *** How are Sats supposed to work? The key stage 2 assessments are billed as a way to measure how well schools are doing, and to identify any problem areas for pupils ahead of their secondary education. In theory, they’re not meant to be a source of stress for the children who take them. “The assessments only include questions on things that children should already have been taught as part of the national curriculum,” the government’s education hub says. “Children shouldn’t be made to feel any unnecessary pressure when it comes to the KS2 assessments.” The exams are calibrated to be a reliable guide to what children have learned, with questions going through three cycles of reviews by teachers and experts before being trialled on 1,000 pupils each time. That process is supposed to avoid any disadvantage for particular groups of pupils and to make sure they produce a range of marks that accurately measures a full range of abilities – since there’s little point in a test that leaves the bottom quartile all scoring zero, or the top one all getting full marks. “They’re supposed to provide a picture of a school’s performance that helps parents know what kind of school they’re choosing, and to see how individual kids are doing,” Sally said. “The idea is that it’s just based on what they’ve been doing all year. It’s meant to be fairly pain-free.” UCL research in 2021 supported that argument: it found little difference in the well-being of children who had taken them and those who had not. Those who defend the existing system might point to news yesterday that pupils in England have risen to fourth place in the world rankings of literacy among nine- and 10-year-olds – beating the US and every other country in Europe. While that measure is taken before the Sats, Prof Alan Smithers, of the University of Buckingham, argued: “Although there are sometimes cries of pain from parents and teachers about the Sats test, there’s no doubt that they set clear objectives for primary schools, and that is reflected in our position on the international scene.” *** What do critics say? Lord Hunt of Kings Heath is put to the test at an event organised by campaign group More Than a Score in December. Photograph: Will Ireland/PinPep/Rex/Shutterstock The argument against Sats is not, typically, that there is no need for assessment of children’s progress: it is that high-stakes external tests that matter so much to schools are bound to create perverse “teach to the test” incentives that drive out what many parents value most about education, and consign children to an “exam factory” at too early an age. They also say that quite often, as in the recent English test, they’re simply too hard. One measure of that: when a group of MPs and peers (pictured above) took a sample test in maths and English last December, they scored lower than the average results achieved by 10-year-olds. (You may think that you’d quite like more than 44% of MPs to be up to year 6 maths, but the point still stands.) “Even if the department says that they aren’t meant to be this way, you hear many stories about kids having revision at lunchtime, or getting homework during half term, or being sick from the stress, and so on,” Sally said. “The news of this recent test will have added to that argument. It feels like a judgement to parents and pupils, and the argument is that it drives a lot of the joy out of a period in education which is supposed to be about enriching children’s lives and making them love education.” The National Education Union says that the UCL research fails to take into account how Sats have changed in recent years. Ninety-five percent of headteachers say too much time is spent preparing for the test, and 90% of teachers are unsatisfied with the system. You might see a vested interest in teachers rejecting a system that demands a lot of them. But parents tend to agree: 95% said Sats had a negative effect on their child’s well-being last year. Nor do parents typically use them to choose a school: Ofsted reports and local reputation are considered much more important, and 85% say they don’t use Sats at all. As for pupils: almost half of year 6 children said they spent most of the year doing practice papers, 60% said they were worried about the exams last year, and one in 10 said they were having trouble sleeping as a result. (You can see all these figures and others in this briefing (pdf) by the campaign group More Than a Score.) *** What would an alternative look like? There are plenty of suggestions from critics – but most centre on replacing Sats with something new. Under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour promised to abolish them altogether, though did not say what the alternative would be; the party doesn’t currently have a stated position on the issue. The EDSK thinktank argues that more frequent, shorter assessments run online that automatically give pupils questions adjusting to their performance would make the process less burdensome for schools and pupils alike and provide a fairer measure of progress. The British Educational Research Association suggests removing the tests – and league tables – and instead using a test of a sample of pupils alongside questionnaires for schools, parents and pupils for a broader measure of success. Any alternative would be more popular with teachers and parents. Nonetheless, the government does not appear likely to abandon the current system, which it sees as one of the tools it will use to get 90% of pupils to expected standards in reading, writing and maths by 2030. That looks a tall order: last year, that target was hit by just 1% of schools. What else we’ve been reading Loreen.

    <head>Angus Taylor signals Coalition may reject Labor changes to petroleum resource rent tax</head>
    <body>Angus Taylor has warned Labor against the “death by a thousand cuts” of the gas industry, signalling the Coalition may reject changes to the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT). The shadow treasurer made the comments at the National Press Club on Wednesday, in an alarming sign for industry that the Albanese government may be forced to deal with the Greens to pass the reform. Related: Federal budget: Labor to collect billions more in petroleum resource rent tax Labor and the Coalition are also engaged in a budget barney over the opposition’s plan to increase the income-free threshold for jobseeker, which the social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, has warned is “not costed”. The government has proposed to limit the proportion of taxable income from offshore oil and gas projects that can be offset by deductions to 90% in a move that could collect $2.4bn over four years. The Greens and independents have suggested more extensive PRRT tax changes could raise more than $9bn every year. The Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association has said Labor’s policy would “provide greater certainty” to the industry and called for bipartisan support to “ensure the ongoing efficiency and administration of the PRRT regime”. On Wednesday Taylor was asked if he was concerned that opposing the PRRT could force Labor to deal with the Greens. He replied that he didn’t “want to get ahead of our processes” because the opposition is still “systematically and methodically” working through the budget. “But there’s a couple of principles that are important regardless of the outcome,” he said. “Number one, if you want more of something, you don’t tax it more. It’s pretty simple. It’s pretty basic economics. “But that’s what Labor has chosen to do here, and it’s disappointing that that’s their approach more generally.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Taylor said that “taxing more” struck him as the wrong way to deliver affordable energy. “We want a gas industry that’s successful in this country, not one that’s dying by a death by a thousand cuts.” In Thursday’s budget reply the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, offered bipartisan support for a range of cost-of-living and welfare measures including improvements to bulk-billing, single parent payments, and jobseeker for those aged 55 to 60. The Coalition has so far withheld support for the $40 a fortnight base rate increase to jobseeker, proposing instead that the amount jobseekers can earn before their payments are reduced increase from $150 to $300 a fortnight. Initially the Coalition suggested this could cost as little as $700m, but on Tuesday Dutton revealed a discrepancy with the Parliamentary Budget Office suggesting it could cost “in the order of about half of what the government is proposing to spend” on jobseeker, or $2.3bn. On Wednesday Rishworth said that while Labor had “focused our support on strengthening the safety net” the Coalition had “just torn that down”. “We also want to ensure that people are able to move off income support into careers, into jobs that are meaningful for them,” she told reporters in Canberra. Rishworth noted that “75% of people on jobseeker and other working-age payments are not reporting any earnings, which means they’re not even using the income free threshold that’s available to them”. Rishworth said there were “no costings” of the Coalition’s policy and “no analysis of what actual improvement it will mean for all those people that have been locked out of the labour market”. In April the treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, indicated that how welfare payments interact with earnings will be a focus of the upcoming full employment white paper. Related: Labor could and should have gone stronger on the petroleum resource rent tax | Rod Sims Kennedy said that “the elasticity of labour supply is higher at the lower end of the income distribution, which is where those on income support are most likely to be”. On Wednesday, Taylor cited the “very good” speech, arguing it reinforced the need for the Coalition’s policy because unemployed people are “paying an effective tax rate of 50-60 cents in the dollar” as their earnings increase. Taylor could not say how much the policy will cost, explaining it was still working with the PBO “now we’ve got the budget parameters”. “We know that this is a policy that has the potential to get more people into work.”</body>

    <head>Disappointment in Papua New Guinea after Biden cancels first visit by a US leader</head>
    <body>Papua New Guineans have reacted with disappointment to the news that US president, Joe Biden, has cancelled his visit to the capital, Port Moresby, in order to focus on debt limit talks in Washington. Preparations for the visit – the first by a sitting US president – began six months ago and included a plan to shut down the country’s airspace as well as to designate next Monday a public holiday to allow residents of Port Moresby to catch a glimpse of the president. Roads were set to be closed and students and cultural dancing groups were planning to line the path of Biden’s motorcade. On Tuesday, before the news of the cancellation broke, the front page of the Post-Courier newspaper featured a full page story on Biden’s security arriving ahead of the visit. Related: What is the US debt ceiling and what happens if it isn’t raised? “We are disappointed that this historic visit has been cancelled as we have prepared well, spent a lot of time, effort and energy towards the visit and we were all looking forward to the visit,” said Powes Parkop, the governor of the National Capital District. Biden had confirmed that he would visit PNG for three hours on Monday, after attending the G7 meeting in Japan, but cancelled on Tuesday evening in order to be in Washington to meet with congressional leaders to avert a debt default. Biden was also set to travel to Sydney to attend a meeting with the leaders of Australia, Japan and India after his visit to PNG. Australia’s prime minister confirmed on Wednesday that the Quad meeting would be postponed as well. “We look forward to finding other ways to engage with Australia, the Quad, Papua New Guinea and the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum in the coming year,” the White House said in a statement. Prime minister James Marape could not be reached for comment, but opposition leader Joseph Lelang said that “many citizens who wanted to catch a glimpse of … Biden would be disappointed”. “But we do understand that there are domestic issues back in the United States that needed his attention,” he said Lelang added that the cancellation of the trip would give the prime minister the opportunity to outline the details of a proposed defence treaty with the US. “Information on the contents of the Defense Cooperation Treaty with the United States [is] sketchy,” said Lelang. This week Marape confirmed that two security agreements would be signed with the US, on defence cooperation and maritime surveillance, during Biden’s visit. Marape had said his government would provide details on the security agreements on Thursday. Opposition groups had raised concerns that PNG would be stuck between and increasingly hostile US and China, if the country signed a security treaty with the US. “We have a foreign policy of ‘Friends to All and Enemies to None’. We … should not be blinded by the dollar sign or be coerced into signing deals that may be detrimental to us, in the long run,” Lelang said. Despite the cancellation of Biden’s visit, operations to provide security for the five presidents and ten prime ministers – including Indian prime minister Narendra Modi – who will be in the country to attend the Forum for the India-Pacific in Port Moresby next Monday will remain in place, according to internal security minister Peter Tsiamalili. “The airport closure only applied for the US president Biden’s visit, so only that will not be applicable, but we will continue to maintain [security] operations for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pacific Leaders,” Tsiamalili said. Meanwhile, Institute of National Affairs (INA) executive director, Paul Barker, said that the cancellation of the visit by Biden “may not be a bad thing for PNG. “He will still send a senior representative, but it was always going to be a bit of a rushed visit,” Barker said. “Preparing for a less rushed visit by the President at a later date, but still before the next US election period rolls out, will enable him to have a more meaningful visit with wider local engagement.” Asia Society Policy Institute senior fellow Richard Maude said the cancellation of Biden’s visit to Papua New Guinea could set back Washington’s battle for influence with Beijing in the region. “The mantra in the region is all about turning up. Turning up is half the battle. China turns up all the time, and so the optics aren’t great,” Maude, a former Australian intelligence chief, told a panel discussion on the Quad on Wednesday.</body>

    <head>‘The reality is worse’: can TV drama end legal woes of Egypt’s bereaved?</head>
    <body>The day before Aly Hegazy graduated from high school in June 2020, his father died from cancer after a long illness. The grief of losing him was compounded by the realisation that, without his father’s signature, he would be unable to go to university. Under Egyptian law, responsibility for Hegazy, who was 17 at the time, and his younger brother fell not to his mother but to his 90-year-old grandfather, who had dementia. A treasured photo of Aly Hegazy’s late father with his mother, Eman Helal, and younger brother. Photograph: Jonathan Rashad/The Guardian Still in mourning, Hegazy’s mother, Eman Helal, began the long, slow process of challenging the country’s guardianship law to take control of her family affairs and get access to her late husband’s pension and bank accounts. Three years on, her legal difficulties continue. “We weren’t ready for any of this,” says Hegazy. The guardianship legislation is one of a number of “personal status laws” that lawyers say are outdated and treat women like criminals. They stem from a passage in the Qur’an that says: “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more [strength] than the other, and because they support them from their means.” The drama series Under Guardianship, which was aired on Egyptian television this year during Ramadan in March and April, followed the struggles of a bereaved mother trying to raise two children whose guardianship had passed to their grandfather. It led the country’s MPs to submit amendments to update the 75-year-old law, but campaigners are sceptical that the slow-moving Egyptian parliament can deliver substantial change.

Photograph: Handout For months after her husband died, Helal struggled financially. Her father-in-law had not left the house for seven years so was unable to attend court to sign the guardianship over to her. Hegazy could not enrol at university. Helal was forced to rely on friends and relatives for money. “The reality is worse than on the TV show,” she says. “Nobody understands what it’s like unless they’ve been through it.” It took six months before Helal was granted a special court hearing to transfer guardianship because of her father-in-law’s dementia. “It was easier for us because we had other sources of income,” says Hegazy. “Other people wouldn’t have survived those six months.” But Helal still does not have direct access to her late husband’s money. The family has to make regular trips to court, queueing with other women to ask the judge to reimburse payments for food, fuel or Hegazy’s tuition fees. Helal has to pay out of her own pocket and present the receipts to the judge, who has the power to refuse a refund. ‘The law should reflect modern life,’ says Eman Helal. Photograph: Jonathan Rashad/Guardian “I want the law to be changed. Guardianship should go from the father to the mother,” says Helal. “They are the two most important people for the children. If, for some reason, it’s not right to give the kids to the mother, the law should account for that, not the other way around. “The law should reflect modern life,” she adds. “Nowadays, women go out and work, she can do everything the children need. It’s not like in the past when women would just sit at home not doing anything.” The guardianship legislation was intended to protect the inheritance of a child before they reached the age of 21, explains Karim Adel, a lawyer based in Cairo, and to prevent the mother from spending it. But in practice, he says, “the court treats the mother as a thief”, with judges reluctant to let women spend money. The law is based on very outdated ideas … the law still sees women as incapable Amira el-Adly MP “Some people want to enrol their kids in international schools,” he says. “These schools cost $10,000 a year or even more. And here is the judge, who is getting the salary of a judge, who sees things differently to the way the mother sees things. So he feels that spending this money on schools is insane.” Menna el-Zuheiry, 25, says: “There are things the court doesn’t always agree to. “Clothes, for example … food, drink, private tuition. We’ll go and ask to buy bottled water and the court will say, ‘just drink from the tap’ or ‘get the bus, why are you getting an Uber?’” When Zuheiry lost her father, Mohamed, to Covid-19 in 2020, her two younger siblings fell under the guardianship of their estranged grandfather. Mohamed, who worked as a customs official, knew he was dying and that his death would leave his family’s money in the hands of a man with whom they had a rocky relationship. However, he was too ill to leave hospital to sign the guardianship over to his wife. “My father worked so hard so that we could have a good future,” says Zuheiry. “And he died worrying about this.” Menna el-Zuheiry: ‘Imagine, we had to go through all of this when our father had just died.’ Photograph: Jonathan Rashad/The Guardian It took Zuheiry’s mother, Um Haidy, months to persuade her father-in-law to give her guardianship. But since then, Haidy “spends every day in the court. Every day. Nothing happens without the court. Imagine, we had to go through all of this when our father had just died.” Amira el-Adly, a member of Egypt’s House of Representatives, says that the Qur’anic verse on which the law is based has been misunderstood and used to argue that women are incapable of managing money. But as she notes: “Even the prophet Muhammad married a businesswoman.” Our legislators still see women as subservient to men and in need of somebody to protect them Azza Soliman “The law is based on very outdated ideas,” says Adly. “We have female politicians, we have doctors, scientists – even the minister of planning and urban development is a woman. But the law still sees women as incapable of managing their children’s money.” For some women, she says, the implications of the guardianship law can be crushing: “Many of these women aren’t working outside the home. Their sole source of income came from their husband.” Even when requests to the court for reimbursement of expenses are approved, women can wait up to eight months to receive it. Amira el-Adly is one of the MPs trying to change Egyptian guardianship law. Photograph: Courtesy of Amira el-Adly Azza Soliman, a lawyer and co-founder of the Center for Egyptian Women’s Legal Assistance, welcomes discussion about changing the law but is sceptical that it will lead to real reform. “We have had a big crisis for a long time,” she says. “Now, suddenly, after one TV drama, they are saying, ‘Oh my God! We have a problem!?’ Please. Pull the other one.” Related: Hit TV drama sparks calls for reform of Egyptian family law According to Soliman, even if the amendments to the guardianship law go through, a host of other personal status laws remain, under which women are treated unfairly. “This is the big mistake we make in Egypt,” she says. “Since 1920, we have changed a few articles here, a few articles there. But we need to change the mentality of our legislators. They still see women as subservient to men and in need of somebody to protect them. “The president and many people who have important positions in this country always talk about women by saying, ‘Oh, she’s like my daughter, my wife, my mother, my sister.’ No, habibi [my dear],” says Soliman. “You need to see me as a citizen.”</body>

    <head>PwC internal review of tax leak ‘continues the cover-up’, Australian senator says</head>
    <body>The scandal engulfing global consulting giant PwC has deepened, with an Australian senator accusing its proposed internal inquiry of “continuing a cover-up” amid calls by a Greens senator for an investigation by the Australian federal police. PwC is the subject of multiple investigations after a former senior executive breached confidentiality agreements while working with Treasury and shared information about future tax policies with colleagues. That information was later used to help clients and make millions of dollars. The Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who was instrumental in obtaining documents that detail the scandal, said the Australian people deserve to know every senior executive who received confidential government information about tax policies. The 144 pages of internal PwC emails are heavily redacted with names and full email addresses removed. It is not clear how many people who received the confidential information, or acted on it, are still employed by the company. Related: ‘Disgraceful breach of trust’: how PwC, one of the world’s biggest accountancy firms, became mired in a tax scandal Earlier this week, PwC announced the businessman Ziggy Switkowski would conduct an investigation into the company’s operations and culture. His report is due by September and could lead to further resignations or sackings. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “When complete, PwC Australia will share a summary of these key recommendations to ensure transparency,” a company spokesperson said. But O’Neill said this limited disclosure indicated the proposed internal review would not meet the standards of transparency expected by the Australian government and taxpayers, and accused the review of “continu[ing] the cover-up”. “PwC have indicated that when that review that they are paying for themselves is completed, they might decide to provide a summary of some parts that they want to be revealed to the public,” O’Neill said. PwC was contacted for comment. Meanwhile, the Greens have obtained independent legal advice suggesting PwC’s actions should be investigated by the Australian federal police. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock has highlighted advice from the Sydney lawyer Brent Fisse, who has considered potential liability issues associated with the misuse of confidential information. “A full AFP investigation should be undertaken into the potential application of the criminal code and the Proceeds of Crime Act,” Fisse said in advice seen by Guardian Australia. “The PwC Australia partnership would not be exposed to potential criminal liability for general dishonesty or conspiracy to defraud because, as a partnership, PwC Australia is not subject to corporate criminal liability. “However, the commonwealth has the power to impose remedies informally or contractually on PwC Australia.” Pocock said “the AFP should be investigating criminal charges right now”. The senator has also suggested the scandal be investigated by the new national anti-corruption commission, which will launch in July. Pocock and O’Neill will use upcoming Senate hearings to get more information about how many people knew confidential information was being misused. “I have a genuine fear about a contagion of these individuals staying at PwC and continuing the practice,” O’Neill said. “This matter isn’t going to go away. There is no way that the commonwealth government or major corporations inside and outside of Australia can continue to do business as usual with PwC after this.” The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said the misuse of confidential government information by PwC was an “abomination”, “unethical and outrageous”. Bragg, who was also critical of PwC’s own proposed inquiry, questioned whether the scandal would have occurred if regulators and enforcement agencies were strong enough to scare executives into doing the right thing. “I have asked to expand the federal inquiry into the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (Asic) and I expect the government will support my effort to do this because we need to look at how they have enforced the accounting laws and standards and ethical frameworks,” Bragg said. “We need to understand why Asic has not been successful in securing prosecutions more broadly, but we also need to understand how this stuff can just happen. Clearly, PwC thought this was something they could get away with.” When PwC’s own investigation was launched, the company’s acting chief executive, Kristin Stubbins, said Switkowski would “have access to all the people and information he needs to conduct a rigorous and robust review”. “We are committed to learning from our mistakes and ensuring that we embrace the high standards of governance, culture and accountability that our people, clients and external stakeholders rightly expect,” Stubbins said.</body>

    <head>Liz Truss in Taiwan calls for ‘economic Nato’ to challenge China</head>
    <body>Free nations must commit themselves to a free Taiwan and must be prepared to back it up with concrete measures, Liz Truss has said in a keynote speech in Taipei, in which she called for an “economic Nato” to tackle Beijing’s growing authoritarianism. The former British prime minister said she had come to show support for Taiwan, which was “on the frontline of the global battle for freedom”, under threat from a totalitarian regime in China. Truss arrived in Taiwan on Monday for a five-day visit, and is expected to meet senior government officials. Truss, who was prime minister for 44 days in 2022 after serving as foreign secretary for the year prior, is the most senior British politician to make the trip since Margaret Thatcher, and drew a rebuke from China’s UK embassy, which said the visit was “a dangerous political show which will do nothing but harm to the UK”. Related: Chinese embassy calls Liz Truss’s trip to Taiwan a ‘dangerous political stunt’ Beijing claims Taiwan as a province of China, and Xi Jinping has not ruled out using force to achieve what he terms “reunification”. Taiwan’s government and people overwhelmingly reject the prospect of Chinese rule, and a potential conflict and its fallout are of key concern to the global community. “We cannot pretend we have meaningful deterrence without hard power,” Truss said in a speech and panel discussion for a Taiwan thinktank, the Prospect Foundation, on Wednesday. “If we’re serious about preventing conflict in the South China Sea we need to get real about defence cooperation.” Truss said the world could not rely on the UN security council or the World Trade Organization, and instead called for a “network of liberty”, with free nations working together to develop an “economic Nato” to coordinate pushback against Beijing. Related: China-Taiwan relations: what’s behind the tensions – in 30 seconds She said the G7 – which will meet this weekend in Hiroshima – needed to coordinate economically against Chinese economic coercion, saying “bullying on a major scale” was taking place across the international area. Truss said Beijing was using Taiwan’s international participation as a strategy, and called for Taiwan’s membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership to be fast-tracked and approved – and China’s denied. Truss is a hawkish member of the British Conservative party, and her speech appeared to rebuke comments made by current members of government and their European counterparts. Last month the UK foreign secretary James Cleverly singled out climate change as an area in which engagement with China was needed, saying it would be a mistake to isolate Beijing. On Wednesday Truss said there were “too many mixed messages from the free world”, which she blamed on a “false idea” that the west could still cooperate with China on some issues. The current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, must make good on earlier comments when he declared China “the biggest-long term threat to Britain”, she added. She called for the shutting down of UK-based Confucius institutes, and for the UK to rule out the resumption of economic dialogue with Beijing, saying: “We cannot have more integration with the Chinese economy.” She said Beijing was already working to make itself economically self-reliant “whether we want to decouple from the economy or not”. Truss also appeared to swipe at recent comments by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying it was “completely irresponsible for European nationals to wash their hands of Taiwan because it’s a long way away or not a core part of our concerns”. Her speech was critical of the Chinese Communist party’s rule over China, referring to the Tiananmen massacre, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and the crackdown in Hong Kong. Truss is the latest in a long line of foreign dignitaries to arrive in Taiwan, often drawing rebuke from Beijing, which objects to any action that appears to give credence to Taiwan’s sovereignty. After the then US speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August, Beijing drastically increased its military harassment of the island, setting a “new normal”, the head of the Prospect Foundation said before Truss’s speech. Asked whether she considered the potential for her visit to worsen the security situation in Taiwan, Truss said Taiwan’s government had invited her and they were “best placed to understand what will help”. “[Beijing] are trying to limit visits, trying to silence Taiwan’s supporters and intimidate people internationally,” she said. “I think we need to stand up to that bullying.” An editorial in the Chinese tabloid Global Times on Tuesday night repeated a criticism by Alicia Kearns, the chair of the UK foreign affairs select committee, that Truss’s visit was “the worst example of Instagram diplomacy”. “These types of ugly performances are attracting fewer and fewer audiences,” the Global Times said.

    <head>Deadly Wellington hostel fire being treated as arson, police say</head>
    <body>A fire that erupted in a Wellington hostel, killing at least six people, is being investigated as arson by New Zealand’s police, who have started a homicide inquiry. Nobody has been arrested, Inspector Dion Bennett said on Wednesday. He would not say why officers believed the fire was deliberately lit, or whether accelerants were used. A day after fire ripped through the 92-room hostel there is still no definite number of people missing, Bennett said. The current total of those unaccounted for is less than 20, including the six confirmed killed, he said. “Gut feeling is that yes, it may climb,” said Bennett of the death toll. Investigators have yet to learn if the source of the blaze was a couch fire that occurred two hours earlier. “As part of our inquiries, we will be seeking to confirm any link between that couch fire and the subsequent fatal fire,” Bennett said in an earlier statement. Related: ‘Manifestation of a crisis’: Wellington hostel fire puts spotlight on dire state of New Zealand housing The fire broke out at 12.25am on Tuesday, prompting dozens of residents of the accommodation, called Loafers Lodge, to flee their beds. Some jumped from windows of the four-storey building, and five were rescued from the roof before the fire was brought under control at about 6am. Bennett said not everyone who was at the hostel had registered themselves as safe with the authorities, and urged those who escaped the building to contact the police. Some residents left their phones in their rooms when they fled. Small groups of police officers entered the charred hostel building for the first time on Wednesday afternoon to begin a scene examination, Bennett said. Entry had not been possible earlier due to concerns about the building’s safety, and the level of contaminants searchers are exposed to is being monitored, he added. The fire service earlier said there were no sprinklers in the building – it was not legally required to have them – and there have been conflicting reports about when and whether alarms sounded at the time the blaze began. The hostel in Newtown – near central Wellington – was home to a mix of short- and long-term tenants, including workers at the nearby hospital. Murray Edridge, the head of the Wellington City Mission, told Radio New Zealand said that clients of the charitable organisation were among those who lived at the hostel. Nine residents were being supervised by New Zealand’s corrections agency. New Zealand’s government will investigate whether building regulations for accommodations like Loafers Lodge are fit for purpose, prime minister Chris Hipkins told reporters at parliament on Wednesday. “I have asked the minister for housing to look particularly at issues around building regulation, to see whether there is anything we should be doing right at this point,” Hipkins said. The prime minister said a friend of his from university was among the missing. Those who died have not been formally named. Chief coroner Anna Tutton said on Tuesday that identification of the bodies could be a “painstaking, slow” process.</body>

    <head>In a contest between Tory MPs and reality, Rishi Sunak is refusing to pick a side</head>
    <body>Conservative leaders fail in one of two ways. Either they resist the demands of their most fanatical MPs or they don’t. Ignoring the zealots provokes rebellion, making the party unmanageable. Indulging them leads to policies that are unworkable. Rishi Sunak is combining both mistakes. The prime minister is giving the right of his party most of what it wants, which is not enough. Everything would not be enough. Britain has left the European Union on terms more drastic than anything promised by the leave campaign, but the demand for separation is unsatisfied. Euroscepticism is an itch that spreads faster than every effort to scratch it. And so Sunak flies to Reykjavík this week for a summit of the Council of Europe to explain to the president of the European court of human rights (not an EU institution) why the rules must be changed so Britain can deport refugees to Rwanda. The Brexit promise was that control of the border would be taken back. From whom? Bureaucrats in Brussels first. Still the frontier is porous. Attention turns to judges in Strasbourg whose overreaching fingers must be peeled off national sovereignty. But meddlesome foreigners never act alone. The quest for control inevitably turns inward. It becomes a pursuit of fifth columnists and a cleansing of unsound minds in the culture. The trajectory is intrinsic to a doctrine that the Tory right embraced before daring to name it – nationalism. Many Eurosceptics are still squeamish about the label. Some recognise the brand limitations of a word that comes historically associated with autocracy and war. Others insist that Brexit is a project for the advancement of free trade and therefore liberal, from a certain angle. In that view, the pattern of xenophobic rhetoric – the Brexit campaign posters depicting dark-skinned interlopers massing at the border; Home Office ministers warning against invading hordes – is a figment of the hysterical remainer imagination. The pretence got harder to sustain this week. Leading figures on the Tory right have mustered for a “National Conservatism” jamboree. They swapped laments about falling birthrates, subjugation by globalised elites and the demoralisation of youth by godlessness and Marxism. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, rehearsed her next bid for the Tory leadership, complaining about the unchecked advance of multiculturalism and calling for British workers to fill vacancies where migrant workers are in short supply. That is a swerve away from government policy, which is quietly more permissive of legal immigration, by way of work visas, while noisily hostile to anyone who turns up uninvited. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, understands that a tight labour market is constraining economic growth. So does Sunak, but he won’t say it aloud. The prime minister’s spokesperson rejected any suggestion that Braverman was freelancing, or that the cabinet is divided on migration matters. The text of her speech was cleared by Downing Street. That doesn’t mean it was welcome. But nor should it be assumed that Sunak stifles liberal qualms when issuing licences to bang the hard right drum. The prime minister is a social conservative by conviction, much more so than his recent predecessors. Liz Truss was a libertarian in all things. She thought government should stay out of people’s private moral choices as well as their bank accounts. Boris Johnson shared that inclination, to the extent that he believed in anything beyond his own ambition. But Johnson also had an interventionist streak that verged on egalitarian when it came to levelling up. Or at least he understood that former Labour voters who had supported him on Brexit wanted tangible payback in public investment, even if he didn’t admit that higher spending meant that either taxes or borrowing must rise. Sunak’s economics are more typically Thatcherite. He hung an icon of Nigel Lawson in his office at the Treasury. The pandemic forced him to override those instincts, subsidising the nation’s wages through lockdowns, but bowing to expediency in a crisis didn’t dent the underlying faith. Likewise, the prime minister’s refusal to cut taxes is not, as some of his Tory critics allege, symptomatic of some socialist mind virus contracted in the Treasury. It is orthodox fiscal conservatism, given a disciplinarian edge by last year’s market backlash against Truss’s wild adventures in budget incontinence. For Conservatives to be led by such a prime minister, one so pious in adherence to the tenets of their creed, yet still feel betrayed goes beyond ideological monomania. It is a kind of childish ingratitude, mixed with weariness at the dull burden of grownup government. That is why a hardcore still hankers for Johnson. They praise his unique electioneering talent, forgetting his ignominious downfall, because the “Boris” show was a delightful deferral of hard choices. They can’t muster any affection for Sunak for the same reason that an alcoholic can’t like the hangover as much as the binge. But sobriety in style is not the same as moderation of belief. Downing Street is now better organised under a prime minister who pays attention to detail and sustains strategic focus. There are plans that don’t change from one hour to the next. Whitehall officials are grateful for the restoration of functional administration, but the underlying tension between ideological obsession and practical government has not gone away. Where Johnson would bluff and bluster, Sunak prefers tactical discretion. Last week’s U-turn on a December deadline for the automatic vaporisation of retained EU law is a case in point. Erasing thousands of statutes without knowing what purpose they serve is an obviously reckless, stupid idea. It was opposed even by the businesses for whose benefit the indiscriminate regulatory purge was intended. The climbdown prompted a predictable backlash from Brexit ultras, mostly directed at Kemi Badenoch, business and trade secretary. She passed the blame – or credit, as it should rightly have been recorded – on to her civil servants. Downing Street made it clear that Sunak was hardly involved in defusing a legislative bomb ticking down in Whitehall, in case anyone might suspect him of losing faith in the doctrine of encouraging enterprise by pointlessly blowing things up. He was all for it during last summer’s leadership contest. What the prime minister believes these days is hard to discern. He indulges his party’s most fanatical tendencies without full-throated endorsement. In return he is tolerated as a caretaker, not trusted as a believer. He is not blind to the practical limitations of Brexit ideology, but nor he does he see beyond them. He has not picked a side between reality and dogma, but stands awkwardly between them, in the churned-up bog of a political no man’s land, sinking. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</body>

    <head>Half of pizzas on sale in the UK contain a whole day’s allowance of salt</head>
    <body>Half the pizzas eaten in Britain contain all of the salt that government scientists say we should be eating in a day, new research reveals. Nutritional analysis of 1,387 different pizzas bought in shops, supermarkets, takeaways and restaurants shows that one of the Domino’s range has more than three days’ worth of salt in it. The brand’s sizzler standard mozzarella stuffed crust medium pizza emerged as the UK’s saltiest pizza in the research. It contains 21.4 grams of salt, which makes it saltier than seawater. In contrast, the maximum daily intake, as recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), is just six grams. However, average consumption remains about 8.4g – 40% higher than the official target. Health experts said the high levels of salt in one of the country’s favourite foods is worrying because it leads to high blood pressure, which is the leading cause of heart attacks and strokes. Action on Salt, the scientific research group which carried out the analysis, warned that the sheer amount of the substance they found in many varieties of pizza showed that the government’s repeated exhortation of the food industry to use less salt had not worked. Indeed some brands of pizza now contain even more salt than they did when Action on Salt undertook a similar study in 2014 – which it condemned as “a disgrace”. For example, the salt content of Domino’s Tandoori Hot standard mozzarella thin and crispy crust pizza has risen over that time from 5.3g to 14.4g. Interactive Sonia Pombo, a registered nutritionist who is the group’s campaign lead, said: “Despite our reliance on the food industry to provide us with access to better, healthier options, it’s infuriating to see some companies ignoring the overwhelming evidence in support of salt reduction and, worse still, increasing the salt content further.” Pizza manufacturers doing so “are showing a complete disregard for public health and are making a mockery of our voluntary reformulation programme”, she added. The salt content of pizzas and other foods is so damaging to health that ministers should extend the principle of the sugar tax to it too, to compel firms to make less salty products, the group said. Graham MacGregor, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London who is the chair of Action on Salt, cited Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) research showing that reducing the population’s salt intake by one gram a day could save 4,000 lives a year. Takeaway pizzas contain more than double the amount of salt found in supermarket-bought ones. Two-thirds of pizzas sold in restaurants and takeaways have 6g or more. Zizzi, Franco Manca and Crosta &amp; Mollica are the retailers and manufacturers with the saltiest pizzas per 100g, while Domino’s, Papa John’s and Caprinos are the worst offenders in the restaurant and takeaway sector, Action on Salt found. However, it also identified the brands with the smallest amounts of salt per 100g. Goodfella’s, Morrisons and the Co-op are the retailers and manufacturers whose pizzas contain the lowest amounts of salt, with Bella Italia, Pizza Express and Fireaway among the restaurant and takeaway operators offering the least salty pizzas. A DHSC spokesperson said: “Thanks to our salt reduction programme, the amount of salt in food has fallen by about 20% – helping to prevent nearly 70,000 heart attacks and strokes while reducing pressure on the NHS. “We’re also taking firm action by restricting the location of foods high in fat, salt or sugar, which will bring health benefits of over £57bn and save the NHS £4bn. “We will continue to work closely with industry to make it easier for people to make healthier choices.”</body>

    <head>This 9/11 suspect and ‘torture prop’ has spent 20 years in Guantánamo. Is he nearing a deal with the US?</head>
    <body>Warning: this article contains graphic images and descriptions of torture On 29 April 2003, 25-year-old Ammar al-Baluchi was snatched off the streets of Karachi by Pakistani authorities and handed over to the CIA. While in CIA custody, he endured extreme forms of cruelty. He was denied sleep for days and became a human experiment for interrogators who practiced brutal methods on him to gain “official” certification in using “enhanced interrogation techniques”. Over the next three years, he was secretly shuttled between six different black sites around the world. Then, in September 2006, he was transferred to Guantánamo Bay, where he still sits in a cell. Though never convicted of a crime, he hasn’t seen a day of freedom since he was first disappeared. According to the US government, Baluchi is one of five co-conspirators responsible for the 9/11 attacks, which killed close to 3,000 people, and he is facing charges that carry the death penalty. Though his name and horrific experiences of torture provided the basis for a character in the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, no journalist has been able to talk directly to Baluchi for the last 20 years. The US government imposes strict rules on communications between him and the outside world. Journalists may not ask him questions via his lawyers, for example. But by talking to his defense team and legal experts, digging deep into the trial record, examining legions of declassified documents and partially redacted transcripts, and comparing his own written accounts of his ordeal with recently declassified CIA documents of his treatment, it is possible to assemble what might be the fullest picture yet of who Ammar al-Baluchi is, how his captors saw him, and what he has endured. The control tower of Camp VI detention facility at Guantánamo Bay naval base. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP Understanding Baluchi and his torture is crucial beyond mere human interest or political curiosity. The torture he and his co-defendants endured and the long-term consequences of that abuse, including the possibility of post-torture therapy treatments, have all become part of plea negotiations, which began after the prosecution approached the defense teams in March 2022. These talks could fail and, if they do, the 9/11 case will probably continue without any resolution for many years to come. But if the talks succeed and a plea agreement is reached, a judgment will finally be entered in one of the biggest legal cases in American history. And the United States will also be one step closer to closing the most infamous site of indefinite detention amid the “war on terror”. But why has the prosecution even proposed a plea deal? And how likely is it to happen? Twenty years of detention Baluchi, who also goes by the name Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, is facing capital charges but, after 20 years of detention, the United States has yet to bring him to trial. Charges against him and his four co-defendants were filed for the second time in 2012, but since then the case has been stuck in endless pre-trial hearings. Over a decade of hearings with no sign of a trial doesn’t seem like normal jurisprudence, but nothing is normal at Guantánamo. The case is being heard by military commission, a new and separate legal system established by the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and modified in 2009. It’s taking place in a courtroom far from the US mainland, behind soundproof glass, and on a 40-second audio delay for those – press, family and NGO observers – allowed to watch its “public” proceedings. Most of the charges Baluchi faces in his military tribunal concern conspiracy, but conspiracy is generally not recognized by international law as a war crime and its status as such under US law remains unsettled. Related: ‘The forever prisoner’: Abu Zubaydah’s drawings expose the US’s depraved torture policy The specter of torture, a crime under both international law and US statute, has haunted these proceedings from the beginning. That this torture was state policy is a dangerous fact for the US government, and from the beginning prosecutors have tried to suppress any mention of it (hence the 40-second delay) while seeking to admit statements made under torture into the record. It hasn’t been that simple. “Administration after administration has assumed the 9/11 case is open and shut, that a jury will convict these guys, give them death sentences, and we’ll be good,” explained Lisa Hajjar, author of The War in Court: Inside the Long Fight Against Torture, a book about torture and the American judicial system in the “war on terror”. “But you cannot have anything that passes the sniff test for justice when people were tortured and disappeared for years.” From the 2014 Senate select committee on intelligence’s “Torture Report” (which references Baluchi over 100 times) to years of litigation from lawyers, journalists, and activists, the gruesome details of torture have been emerging, sometimes in drips, other times in waves. Also emerging has been the degree of coordination between the CIA and FBI in holding and questioning men. Prosecutors have long relied on the idea of separation between the CIA and FBI, arguing that statements made to the FBI were not coerced and are therefore admissible in court. Yet court transcripts in 2021 revealed that at least nine FBI agents were temporarily assigned as CIA agents at black sites, complicating the picture. We can’t ask Baluchi what happened to him and, like the rest of his co-defendants, he hasn’t had the opportunity to testify about it in open court. Until December 2013, in Guantánamo’s military commissions, a defendant’s own memories of his torture were considered classified, and, to this day, any statement a defendant makes about the CIA still undergoes classification review. In 2021, Majid Khan recounted the torture he endured at US hands. Photograph: AP But in 2021, another man, Majid Khan, openly recounted for the first time the torture he endured at the hands of the United States. This statement was part of Khan’s plea deal from years earlier. Khan, who was a courier for al-Qaida, described to a military jury the harrowing treatment he received in CIA custody. In grisly detail, he explained how he was shackled, hooded, and kept naked for days on end. He talked about being force-fed with “a plunger to force the food quickly” into his stomach and how a puree of “hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins” was shoved up his rectum. His eyeglasses were broken early in his confinement, and he was not given a new pair for three years, he said. He was repeatedly beaten and waterboarded. He was sexually assaulted and forcibly submerged in ice water, and much more. All this happened before he arrived at Guantánamo Bay, a place he described as “death by a thousand cuts”. During his statement, he also spoke of his remorse for his actions with al-Qaida. “There is not a day that goes by that I am not sorry for what I have done,” Khan said. Seven of eight senior officers on his military jury were moved enough by his words to recommend clemency for the 41-year-old. “The treatment of Mr Khan in the hands of US personnel should be a source of shame for the US government,” they wrote. Khan completed his 10-year sentence at Guantánamo, which started with his guilty plea in 2012, and he has since been resettled in Belize. While observing developments in the Khan case, the 9/11 trial prosecutors began to see more details about questionable CIA and FBI activity emerge. According to Hajjar, who follows the military commissions closely, the prosecutors soon realized that “they [could not] achieve what they had sought to achieve”. Unanimous death sentences that would withstand appeal seemed ever more unlikely, so “plea bargaining, from the government’s point of view, became necessary”, she said. In March 2022, the government approached defense teams in the 9/11 trial for plea negotiations. While details haven’t been made public, the broad outlines have been reported. The men would plead guilty and the government, in exchange, would no longer seek the death penalty. Since Congress passed a law forbidding the transfer of any Guantánamo detainee to the US mainland, sentences would probably be served at Guantánamo Bay. The length of sentence would be worked out individually for each of the five. Parts of the deal proposed by the defense must be decided by policymakers, so they have been labeled “policy principles”, according to court filings. What’s known about these policy principles is that they concern conditions of confinement, rehabilitation from torture, and adequate medical care. The policy principles have been sent to Caroline Krass, general counsel of the Department of Defense, who, perhaps problematically, also served as general counsel for the CIA between 2014 and 2017. And since these plea negotiations began, the military commission on the 9/11 case has been sitting in limbo, waiting for over a year for a response. ‘Enhanced measures on Ammar’ Ammar al-Baluchi is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the man often called the “mastermind of 9/11”. (Alongside Mohammed and Baluchi, the three other men facing charges for the 9/11 attacks are Mustafa al-Hawsawi, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Walid bin Attash.) Baluchi was born in Kuwait, but his roots are from Baluchistan, an area that covers parts of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and Baluchi spent most of his teenage years in Iran and Pakistan. He then moved to Dubai, where he worked in computers before relocating to Pakistan in September 2001, after his Dubai visa expired. He speaks Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Baluchi, and English. The government alleges that, at his uncle’s behest, Baluchi wired over $100,000 in several transactions to some of the 9/11 hijackers. It’s said he kept the money in a laundry bag. He’s also alleged to have helped some of the hijackers in the United Arab Emirates before they traveled to the US. According to trial transcripts of government witnesses, Baluchi says he didn’t know for certain what the men he had wired money to were planning. Detainees from Afghanistan sit in their cells at Camp X-Ray at Guantánamo, 2002. Photograph: Lynne Sladky/AP In April 2003, he was arrested with Walid bin Attash in Pakistan because of an “unrelated criminal lead”, according to the CIA. Reports at the time of his arrest say the men were seized with 300lb of explosives with them. First questioned by the Pakistanis (with the CIA watching a live video feed), Baluchi was described as forthcoming, even “chatty”. But the CIA wanted him, and days after his arrest he entered their custody. Before the Pakistanis turned Baluchi over to the US, the decision had “probably” been made to use “enhanced measures on Ammar”, according to CIA documents. The US was convinced he held “perishable information” on an imminent attack on the US consulate and a residential compound in Karachi. Taken to Black Site Cobalt in Afghanistan, Baluchi immediately had his beard and head shaved and a medical professional performed the intake. Deemed healthy, he had “no apparent medical contraindications for enhanced measures”. When the US took him in mid-2003, Baluchi weighed 141lb. By late 2003, his weight had dropped to 119lb. Initially starved of food for four days, Baluchi was given two cans of Ensure. Meanwhile, CIA headquarters sent his interrogators a list of approved techniques to be used on him: “the facial slap, the abdominal slap, walling, the stress position of standing with his forehead against the wall, the stress position of kneeling with his back inclined toward his feet, water dousing, cramped confinement, and sleep deprivation in excess of 72 hours”.

Among them were “isolation, sleep deprivation not to exceed 72 hours, reduced caloric intake (as long as the amount is calculated to maintain the general health of the detainee), deprivation of reading material, use of loud music or white noise (at a decibel level calculated to avoid damage to the detainee’s hearing), and the use of diapers for limited periods (generally not to exceed 72 hours or during transportation where appropriate)”. Baluchi underwent all of it, often at the same time. The lead interrogator explained that his way of using sleep deprivation was to keep Baluchi naked and standing in total darkness while blasting music by Eminem “to humiliate the detainee and make him uncomfortable in the cold”. Baluchi also described the use of music as an instrument of his torture. “I [was] suspended from the ceiling, my hands above my head. I was completely naked. It was very cold. Even that was not enough for them,” he wrote. “So they added the element of blasting music 24/7, nonstop, for months and months.” He identified one song in particular, My Plague, by the American heavy metal band Slipknot (“Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you” is one refrain). Going through his mind “was the conviction that I was about to be killed. It was just a matter of when. I was counting every second, every minute, and on many occasions I thought I was already dead”. He was also repeatedly doused with cold water, a procedure separate from “waterboarding”, yet still “outside the bounds of what we were supposed to be doing”, as one interrogator notes. The “water the interrogators used was excessively cold and some of it had ice in it”, a CIA report states. Baluchi described the procedure as being pushed down on a tarpaulin, after which “one man poured ice water on my face” and “four men at the corners of the sheet would raise and lower the corners to move the ice water to different parts of my body”, eventually forcing the water on his chest “so that I would try to suck in air but breathe in water instead”. The effect was traumatizing. “I was sure they were going to finally kill me and wrap me up in the sheet,” he wrote. Perhaps the most shocking element of his treatment is how Baluchi became a training prop for interrogators for multiple techniques but especially for “walling”. This is when a detainee is placed in front of a wall designed to have some flexibility to it. A rolled-up towel is put around his neck, and the interrogator holds the towel and then shoves the detainee “backward into the wall, never letting go of the towel”. The technique is meant to produce a great “noise” and frighten the detainee. “The ‘goal’ was to bounce the detainee off the wall,” one interrogator notes. A drawing by the Guantánamo detainee Abu Zubaydah depicting “walling”. Photograph: Abu Zubaydah To gain “certification” as interrogators, student interrogators “lined up” to “wall” Baluchi, who was kept naked during the process. The trainees would take turns “walling” Baluchi but sessions typically “did not last for more than two hours at a time”, because “fatigue would set in for the interrogator doing the walling”. “They smashed my head against the wall repeatedly,” Baluchi wrote in court filings. “As my head was being hit each time, I would see sparks of lights in my eyes. As the intensity of these sparks were increasing as a result of repeated hitting, then all of [the] sudden I felt a strong jolt of electricity in my head. Then I couldn’t see anything. Everything went dark and I passed out.” He notes that “after this particular head injury I lost my ability to sleep ever since”. ‘He is a different person now’ The first 25 minutes of the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty enacts a similarly gruesome interrogation of a suspect named “Ammar”, a character who shares the biographical details of Baluchi. The film-makers worked closely with the CIA on the film, and the character of Ammar “is modelled after Ammar Baluchi”, states a declassified CIA draft memorandum. In fact, the CIA provided the film-makers with the very details of Baluchi’s treatment that the government was withholding from his defense team at the time on the grounds that the details were classified. In the film, Ammar is shown as either a brooding monster or a pathetic bag of pain. Then, after 96 hours of sleep deprivation and a clever little CIA bluff (along with a meal of “hummus, tabouli, and I don’t know what that is”, to quote his interrogator), Ammar begins talking and reliable information floods out of mouth. A CIA report, on the other hand, tells us something else about how things really happened. While he was labeled as “hard corps” [sic] and “defiant” by some interrogators, it was clear to many others that Baluchi simply told his handlers what they wanted to hear. Interrogators expressed concern that Baluchi was “blurting out information and making it up because he wanted Agency officers to stop” water dousing him. Baluchi “was afraid to tell a lie and was afraid to tell the truth because he did not know how either would be received”, according to the CIA. He was also petrified that he would be killed once he stopped providing information. “Agency officers,” a CIA report notes, “focused more on whether Ammar was ‘compliant’ than on the quality of information he was providing.” Baluchi’s real-life interrogators also held many opinions about his character. What emerges is a picture of a sensitive, animated, and intelligent young man. While he is twice called a hypochondriac and once histrionic, he is also labeled as “bookish”, “a philosopher, thoughtful, rational, and logical”, and “one of the more cooperative, likable, and even gentle detainees”. One interrogator who “describes her circumstances as very ‘odd’” says she found herself “sitting across from a terrorist who was responding to her as though he could be a graduate school student in the United States”. Reda Kateb as Ammar in Zero Dark Thirty. Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy In mid-2004 and at a different black site, Baluchi fainted in his cell. At one point, he told his captors of his difficulties reading texts. At another, he described how, after being “walled” by interrogators, “he could not recall complete memories because he tended to daydream”. By early 2006, a medical assessment noted his “attention difficulties” while concluding that “there is no evidence of any significant or prolonged mental harm”. But later assessments tell a different story. Between 2015 and 2020, four different medical professionals, sent by his defense team, determined that Baluchi’s torture has had long-term consequences, including brain damage from the “walling”. The damage inflicted by torture has “seriously diminished” Baluchi’s “psychological functioning and has left him with mild to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury and moderate to severe anxiety, depression, and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder”, notes one neuropsychologist. “I feel like my body and mind are deteriorating,” Baluchi wrote in 2014. “I am well educated and speak several different languages, but I can no longer read or concentrate. It is difficult for me to write letters, and at times I can’t even track a conversation. I am always exhausted, yet I can’t sleep.” “When you sit with him and talk to him, you can see there was a person who existed before he was tortured,” Alka Pradhan, one of the lawyers on Baluchi’s defense team, told me. “He can sort of access that person. He knows that person. He has memories of that life as that person. But he is a different person now, and this is very difficult to explain to people who have not sat in a room with a torture victim.” Calls for ‘a rapid conclusion’ In December 2021, Brig Gen John Baker, who headed the Military Commission Defense Organization for more than five years, testified before the Senate judiciary committee. “The only path to ending injustice in the military commissions – for the accused detainees, for the country, and above all for the victims of 9/11 and the other crimes currently on trial at Guantánamo – is to bring these military commissions to as rapid a conclusion as possible,” which for Baker means “a negotiated resolution of the cases”, he said. A protest calling for Guantánamo’s closure in April. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images James Connell III, the lead defense counsel for Baluchi, agrees. “Right now, the only option on the table that will bring judicial finality is some kind of negotiated resolution,” he told me, stating that the defendants in the 9/11 trial “are so damaged that they can barely participate in their court”. Ted Olson was the solicitor general of the United States in 2001. His wife Barbara was killed on 9/11 when her plane was hijacked and flown into the Pentagon. Olson, too, believes a negotiated settlement is the best path forward. “The US must bring these legal proceedings to as rapid and just a conclusion as possible,” he wrote in the Wall Street Journal in February 2023. “True justice seems unattainable. The best the US government can do at this point is negotiate resolutions of the remaining Guantánamo cases.” Yet, Guantánamo has remained open through four presidencies, and during that time, prisoners who have been convicted of no crimes have continued to age, their bodies and minds spiraling downward in post-torture deterioration. If opening Guantánamo was a politically brazen act in the months following 9/11, bringing the military commissions to an end would be the politically courageous one. Stakeholders from all sides of the case appear united in the view that the military commission has failed and that plea agreements must follow. All that’s needed is the political will. But does the will exist? That’s the question looming, for more than a year, over this quiet courtroom on a remote corner of a far-away island. Meanwhile, the Biden administration continues to offer only silence on what ultimately is its decision as a presidential election approaches. This lack of political resolve means defense attorneys, prosecutors, judges, and legal advocates are all learning the very skill that the defendants and the victims’ families have honed over the last 20 years. They’re all waiting.</body>

    <head>‘In London there is no space at all’: the rise of self-storage as rents soar</head>
    <body>Last Sunday morning at the Space Station self-storage depot in Cricklewood, north-west London, Merlin, 49, a care worker, was on her weekly visit to her unit – a space not much larger than a broom cupboard. She was depositing duvets and removing a bag of sun cream and an exercise machine as she managed the transition from winter to summer. Her unit was neat – house proud even. She even had installed a wine rack and a clothes rail, on which outfits were carefully hung. “My flat is so small, I need the extra space,” she said. She pays £160 a week for a single room in a shared flat, but it is better value to rent this storage for £120 a month than find a bigger home. Nalia Echchen, 35, uses three large units to run an Amazon-based retail business selling Moroccan textiles, under the brand of Maroccanity. Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian She is one of more than 300 people for whom the Cricklewood depot, managed by Gareth Wood, has become an essential adjunct to home. Wood asks new customers why they are using the storage, but the answer is often simple. “Do you live in London? That’s why you need storage,” he said. “ You don’t have a shed or a spare room. People are just trying to declutter and are making space.” New flats going up in the area mean more business. A Matalan is about to be knocked down and replaced with an apartment block and “as soon as that goes up I imagine there will be a big need,” Wood said. Patricia, a live-in domestic worker, rents a small £162-a-month unit in the facility because she says her boss doesn’t allow her to have many possessions in the house. “This is my home,” she said, indicating the yellow door of her storage unit. “It’s an important place for me. I know people who sleep on buses and keep their clothes here. That’s happening here in this country.” Behind another steel door, a writer has turned a unit into a library while Ivan Arvay, 42, originally from Slovakia, has filled his unit with wooden wine crates that he turns into furniture as a hobby. He simply doesn’t have room in his studio apartment. “It is [crazy],” he agrees. “In Slovakia even in a studio flat you have storage in the cellar but here there is no storage at all.” Businesses account for around one in five customers. Among those at the Cricklewood Space Station is Nalia Echchen, 34. She uses three units for her Amazon-based retail business selling Moroccan textiles, under the brand Maroccanity, and Pokemon figures and other toys. Boxes of toys teeter over a desk and computer she has installed in one corner – effectively turning the unit into an office as well as a warehouse. She has hung a map of the US to remind her of the road trip she one day hopes to enjoy if business thrives. “I started selling from home and when I had too much stock, I used storage,” she said, as she worked on orders alongside her assistant, Mariana Repeti, 28. Echchen spends £1,500 a month on the units but she has developed a business that turns over £400,000 a year. It may not be glamorous, but it is effective. Self-storage is not just booming in the major cities. Rental returns have been increasing in all regions apart from the south-west and operators are expanding in places such as Slough and Northampton. And the uses are extremely diverse. In Coventry, Ross Morris, who used to work in a self storage facility said there were several men fixing motorbikes and car parts in some units and a DJ practising in another, “the deep thud of bass often emanating from his container”. At a certain point a team of builders rented a unit, filled it with rubble, stopped paying the rent and were never seen again. “A heroin addict was once living in one,” he said. “We cleared his container of needles, a single mattress, a camping stove and a giant bag of pasta. Not sure how long he had been living in there. Containers have been raided by the police on multiple occasions. Drug dealers operating out of them and people storing illegal cigarettes. There is almost no limit to what people use them for – from every walk of society.” Kevin Prince, who runs the Space Station chain, recalled a run-in with one customer. “I had a really difficult customer who was quite rude and arrogant, never paid on time and always gave me a hard time,” he said. “And then he just stopped responding at all.” After a couple of months not paying rent Prince cut the customer’s lock off and found the unit empty. The customer had removed all his possessions, but “in the middle of the room was a 4ft inflatable penis”. “I think I knew what he was saying to me,” said Prince. Tee, a software engineer who lives in an adapted Land Rover, partly due to expensive rent, said he believes “storage is a powerful tool in allowing people to live tiny”. He uses it to “change the contents of the Land Rover depending on what I’m doing”. If he’s going hiking he’ll deposit his bike and hot water shower and pick up his hiking gear. “I have about four or five different configurations of my mobile home I can choose from because I have storage and can swap items in and out,” he said. Meanwhile, Jo, 54, an education manager in Brighton, who could not afford £1,200 a month rent during Covid said she hired an £80-a-month Big Yellow unit for her belongings and saved money sofa-surfing and using Airbnbs for two years. Returning to normal renting after the pandemic she missed “going back to the Big Yellow looking at all my stuff in one place”. “Now it’s all distributed again, it doesn’t have the punch,” she said.</body>

    <head>Cycads: the primeval plants getting rarer – and harder to protect</head>
    <body>Cycads are the most threatened group of plants in the world. These ancient plants date back about 280m years, before the age of the dinosaurs, and they look primeval, with a rugged chunky trunk rising into a crown of stiff feathery leaves. They are disappearing as their tropical forest habitats are rapidly vanishing, and they also face extinction from an illegal multimillion-pound global trade in wild cycads. The rarer they become, the more their value increases, with some individual specimens selling for millions of pounds each. The loss of such rare plants removes their gene pool from the wild, depletes their numbers and brings them closer to extinction. Poachers can also destroy whole habitats plundering the plants, and the trafficked plants are at risk of disease. Trying to protect the cycads is highly dangerous, and rangers in Kruger national park in South Africa have been killed in order to steal the plants. There are no dedicated funds or organisations to combat the illegal cycad trade. If these were giant pandas, black rhinos or elephants there would be an outcry – a familiar story for other endangered, rare plants.</body>

    <head>Housing crisis drives £1bn-a-year boom in UK self-storage</head>
    <body>Britons have packed away enough possessions to fill Buckingham Palace more than 60 times over as the housing crisis, enduring consumerism and a sentimental reluctance to let go of inanimate objects means self-storage is now on the brink of becoming a £1bn-a-year business. Self-storage units are proving cheaper than renting or buying a bigger home and are springing up alongside new housing developments across the UK, with at least 280 more stores planned between now and 2026 – a more than 10% increase. In 2022, UK households and businesses piled enough additional items into storage units to occupy more than 2m sq ft (185,000 sq metres), driving up revenues among operators – including Big Yellow and Safestore – by 6.5% to £990m, according to a study by the property agency Cushman &amp; Wakefield and the Self Storage Association UK. Interactive Amid increasing signs that shuttling to and from a self-storage facility is becoming a routine part of urban life for hundreds of thousands of people, two-thirds of customers now keep their unit for around two years and 16% stay for at least five years. Self-storage gains from both sides of the online retail boom, hosting online retailers who dispatch products to consumers, who haven’t got room for them and so end up taking them to self-storage. “Marvellous isn’t it?” said Kevin Prince, the chief executive of Space Station, who opened his first unit in 1997, now manages 14 units, and is about to add 13 more. “Long may that continue.” The high cost of housing and shrinking residential floor space are key drivers of rising demand that is attracting global investors, not just in the UK but in other rent hotspots such as New York and California where people can pay $25,000 a year for a unit. Demand is also driven by people acquiring possessions in the hope that they will soon be able to upsize their home, but being thwarted by the housing market, analysts said. “Self-storage operators reported a combined £990m of revenue and increased profitability in 2022 as the sector’s growth continued unabated despite the pressures on household budgets,” the study concludes. A 90 sq ft unit typically costs £273 a month to rent in London and £131 in the north of England, which is cheaper than residential property. Interactive An industry survey of more than 1,800 UK customers found that the most common reason for using self-storage was a lack of room for the items at home, followed by a house move, major life event such as a death, inheritance or divorce, and renovations. One in five renters are now business customers, often e-commerce retailers. The self-storage industry describes its product as ‘sticky’ as many people keep units for longer than they expect. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian The range of possible users is huge. Renters and staff told the Guardian that units had been used by homeless people as a base while they sofa-surf or sleep on buses; a heroin addict who broke the rules by moving in a mattress to sleep on; a family who wanted their son to learn the drums where it wouldn’t disturb them; and by people trying to “live tiny” by having the smallest possible flat and using the storage as an annexe for half of their possessions. Helping to embed storage in the urban fabric, the Space Station chain has installed a hairdresser, florist, vape shop, tattooist and dog beautician at one of his facilities in Shrewsbury. Many other operators are starting to add office space. In London’s Kings Cross, where thousands of flats have been constructed in recent years, the finishing touches are being put to a new Big Yellow featuring a stylish brick facade equal in architectural merit to the nearby apartment blocks. “An increasing proportion of people, whether by choice or necessity, are staying in rented accommodation for longer,” said Philip Macauley, the head of self-storage at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. “On-site self-storage can be a valuable amenity for residents in large developments, especially if they don’t have cars.” The industry describes its product as “sticky” because most new customers think they will only use it for a couple of months, but once many people move their stuff in, they struggle with the decision to take it out. Interactive “We get very sentimental about inanimate objects,” said Prince. “So that sentiment is good for the sector.” He added: “Nobody buys stuff to keep for life. We buy it and when we get bored of it we change it. Storage is good in that it encourages people to save things and reuse them rather than just throw them away and replace. I don’t know what percentage of that actually happens because there’s many occasions where we’ve had people stay for a long period of time and then they just phone the manager and say ‘can you get me a skip so I can throw all these things away’.” Self-storage stats Big Yellow is the UK’s largest operator by floorspace. Photograph: Philippe Hays/Rex Features Self-storage is increasingly profitable. Big Yellow, which has 108 stores and is the UK’s largest operator by floorspace, recorded a 30% increase in adjusted profits before tax in 2022, reaching £96.8m. Revenues at the next largest operator, Safestore, rose 14% in the same year to £213m. In 2022, a single self-storage depot in Camden, London, was sold to Shurgard for £6m, and four properties in Banbury, Wednesbury, Frome and Amesbury were acquired by Storage King for £59m. A 500-unit facility can be looked after by only four staff members. More people say they have used self-storage more because of the cost of living crisis than used it less, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield survey The most likely age of a customer is between 55 and 64, and the most common income bracket is £21,000 to £31,000 a year, with demand falling among people with higher incomes. Half of customers are single, widowed, separated or divorced. 65% of domestic customers have occupied their unit for about two years, and 43% for a year or less. Another 16% have had their unit for more than five years.</body>

    <head>Malawi’s Rastafarian children return to school after ban on dreadlocks is lifted</head>
    <body>About 1,200 Rastafarian children in Malawi are expected to return to state schools over the next month after being banned for a decade because of their hair. After a landmark decision at the high court in March, letters have now been sent out to about 7,000 schools telling headteachers that the exclusion of children with dreadlocks from the classroom has been ruled as unconstitutional. The high court judge, Zione Ntaba, who presided over a long-running judicial review of government policy in Malawi’s former capital, Zomba, ordered the education ministry to inform state schools that they must admit Rastafarian children by 30 June. In Malawi, primary school is provided free of charge but enrolment had previously required all children to cut their hair. Rastafarianism developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, an Afrocentric belief system based around certain tenets of the Bible and against western colonialism. For some it is a religion, for others a way of life, says Ezaius Mkandawire, a father and Rastafarian community leader in Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe. Mkandawire has been campaigning for several years on behalf of his three children Makeda, six, Uhuru, eight age, and Urunji, 14, who had been excluded from state schools due to their dreadlocks. Within Malawi’s small Rastafarian minority, an estimated 15,000 people follow Rastafarianism as a religion and thousands more have adopted it as a way of life, or what Mkandawire calls “livity”. As such, their hair has sacred symbolism, as referenced in several passages in the Old Testament, and cutting it or using “a razor” on it is anathema to Rastafarians. The court ruling has now prompted many in the Rastafarian community to request compensation from the government for their children’s exclusion from school, saying their rights were violated by the “archaic policy” that had classed dreadlocks as “unhygienic” and that their children had suffered as a result. Mkandawire said their campaigning for the government to address the damage caused by the ban would continue, calling for the establishment of special vocational schemes and loans to help the young people who missed out on education. “We are not fighting with the government, or throwing stones, but [trying] to reason with them,” said Mkandawire, adding that some young people had slipped into criminal activities because of the ban. Like many Rastafarian parents, Pemphero George found it distressing when her children were refused entry and sent home from school because of their dreadlocks. “My children’s right to education and freedom of association was put to question” because of the ban, she said. George, 30, runs a stall in Lilongwe, selling handmade caps, ginger plants and fruit. She could not afford to send her three children to private school, and so felt forced to cut their hair. “I had no choice but to cut their dreadlocks, a thing which was not easy at all,” she said. “It was painful seeing my own children being deviated from Jah’s teachings. Cutting hair means disobeying God’s commandments, according to our religious beliefs.” Related: ‘We live in fear because of our skin’: Malawians with albinism demand action to reduce cancer risk She said she was happy about the court ruling but added that many Rastafarian parents would always feel judged – and compelled to make extra efforts to ensure their children looked neat at school. Patrick Galawanda, an education coordinator and Rastafarian community leader who was among the group who took the case to the high court, said the resolution was long overdue and that he was delighted to see “this battle” coming to an end. Rastafarians had complained of discrimination after being left out of an agreement in June 2021, when a Malawian civil society organisation, the Public Affairs Committee, encouraged Muslims and Christians to sign a memorandum of understanding which, among other things, allowed Muslim students to wear a hijab or headscarf to school.</body>

    <head>High Desert review – Patricia Arquette’s comedy is so jampacked it’s exhausting</head>
    <body>Perhaps it is a sign that I have watched too much television, or a sign that television has watched too much television and all entertainment is about to eat itself in the tri-meta-po-mo world we live in – but my overriding thought when watching Patricia Arquette’s magnificent turn in High Desert is: “This is what it would be like if a Jennifer Coolidge character was real.” Which I think is, overall, a compliment, and for Arquette and her writers a triumph. On the other hand, it can make things exhausting. High Desert is many things but it is not a bingewatch. In fact, it is precisely because it is so many things that you are better off consuming it as a weekly half-hour treat than a straight eight-episode feast. Arquette plays Peggy, a warm-hearted, lovably absurd figure whom we meet hosting a family party in her luxurious SoCal home for Thanksgiving 2003. Then the DEA burst through the door and put an abrupt end to what turns out to have been a drug-deal-fuelled lifestyle (“Just pot! And a little hash!” she later protests. “I only did cocaine”). We next meet her 10 years later, after the recent death of her beloved mother Roslyn (Bernadette Peters). Her husband Denny (Matt Dillon) is in prison, she is on a methadone treatment programme, estranged from her now grownup son and working as a barmaid/can-can girl at an Old West theme park. When her siblings Stewart and Dianne (Keir O’Donnell and Christine Taylor) – still smarting from being caught up in the DEA raid a decade ago, though one suspects Peggy and her addictions haven’t given them a lot of peace since then – announce that they need to sell the family home Peggy lived in while caring for Roslyn, the pressure is on for Peggy to find a job she can do in between can-cans that pays enough to afford the mortgage. When her best friend Carol (Weruche Opia) is ripped off for $300 by private investigator Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), Peggy rolls up her sleeves, goes round to collect the cash and finds her true calling as a PI. After terrorising Harvey’s landlord into waiting for Harvey’s unpaid rent, she finds their first proper case – a fellow dancer’s ex appears to be selling stolen masterpieces. He (played by Rupert Friend) is a former TV presenter who had a meltdown on air and, in true California fashion, reinvented himself as “Guru Bob”. He now uses the catchphrase that sent his live breakdown viral (“Everything is stupid!”) as a mantra for his followers. On top of that there is a theft from the theme park safe; a missing mafia wife; a nipple-slicing father-daughter hitman team; the release of Denny from prison and Peggy’s inability to resist being drawn into various scams and schemes he comes up with; acid trips and flashbacks; a TV actor who is a dead ringer for Roslyn (also played by Bernadette Peters), which causes quite some discombobulation, especially during the acid trips – and much, much more. That it makes sense at all is down to Arquette, whose powerful charisma draws the whole thing together, and whose ability to keep a vulnerable side to Peggy apparent through all her chaos, misjudgments and exuberance gives you something to invest in. Otherwise, High Desert is very much a case of style over substance. It looks gorgeous, there is an endless parade of side characters, each brighter and kookier than the last, and the New Agey energy and stupidity of southern California is at least as much a presence as they are. But there is too much going on to allow the viewer to care about any of it other than Peggy herself. It feels like a fertile premise – how do you rebuild a life when you only want to have fun and make sure everyone around you has fun too? – largely squandered, in terms of comedy and drama. Because although you keep waiting for them and often feel – in a trippy, Peggy-life way – that you must have heard some, there aren’t actually any jokes in High Desert. It’s always a rush, but without backstories (Carol’s mysterious past, for example, is never explored) or any deeper digging into exactly what produced the bundle of charm, resourcefulness and idiosyncracies that is Peggy, it starts to feel a bit empty. It is enough, of course, for something to be fun while it lasts. But with Arquette and everyone around her clearly capable of so much more, and the premise perfectly set up for them to do so, it’s a shame it didn’t happen. • High Desert is on Apple TV+</body>

    <head>Country diary: The bittersweet arrival of nine clean, alert piglets</head>
    <body>The sight of Irving’s trailer creaking backwards into the yard is a familiar one, though we don’t associate it with this season. Usually he arrives in November, as he did last year, delivering a boar to put with our saddleback sow. Mind you, the ground conditions today are not dissimilar, this spring mirroring last year’s early winter with its unending wet and mud. Today’s delivery is of nine weaners – piglets around eight weeks old – and a mixture of gilts (females) and boars. It’s difficult to resist a smile as I peer through the vent on the trailer’s side. But the pleasure is bittersweet. Our sow farrowed in March. It was a straightforward evening’s work, notwithstanding the fact that she produced 15. She is a gentle creature and tolerant of assistance, but a primitive protectiveness takes over once she has shed the afterbirths, (two pieces, one from each horn of the uterus) so it is best to give her space. Besides, this was her fourth farrowing and she had proved herself the most diligent of mothers. A few fatalities are inevitable in a large litter, but over the next 24 hours, more came. Why? Everything appeared normal – she was lying with teats exposed, the piglets somnolently latched on. ‘Hours later, they are still out delightedly digging.’ Photograph: Sarah Laughton Then it struck me. A feeding sow will rhythmically grunt, but this time everything was abnormally quiet. Not even the vet’s injection of oxytocin, a hormone stimulant, could induce her to let down her milk. With nothing to sustain them, the whole litter perished. It was utterly distressing, the more so for being without explanation. Often in farming, you are further back than when you started. We have a much-loved sow that we can no longer assume to breed from and we’ve paid for weaners before we’ve begun to rear them, with commercial feed prices still high, not to mention the emotional toll this has taken. But these thoughts are banished as nine immaculately clean piglets bundle down the ramp and into the sty. They pause, calm but alert, their snouts busily taking it all in. Then one heads for the open field and the rest skitter after. Hours later, they are still out delightedly digging – at least someone is glad of the mud.

    <head>Why does it take a deadly fire for New Zealand to pay attention to how its most vulnerable live?</head>
    <body>It shouldn’t take a fire and yet so often it does. In the wake of tragedy, questions will be asked about the living conditions of the six people who died in the Loafers Lodge boarding-house, but as ever, too late. Loafers Lodge is just one of several hundred similar boarding houses scattered across New Zealand. Once predominantly a rough but functional form of accommodation for single working men, such places have long since catered to a wider range of people, most of them down on their luck. Related: ‘Manifestation of a crisis’: Wellington hostel fire puts spotlight on dire state of New Zealand housing The tenants of Loafers Lodge included nurses working shifts at the nearby Wellington hospital, but also cash-strapped retirees, people on community sentences and other members of the marginalised and vulnerable poor. I first came across boarding houses a decade ago, when I spent three weeks as an undercover reporter in one in central Wellington. The rooms were foul-smelling, dirty and damp. Some windows didn’t close properly, so the rain just came “hosing through”, as one resident observed. The place provided just one working shower for 14 people, and even that had a cracked concrete floor. There was no hot water in the hand-basins, no toilet paper in the toilets. The kitchen, such as it was, boasted neither fridge nor washing machine. It&apos;s not obvious yet what exactly has gone wrong at Loafers Lodge and why lives have been lost. Maybe it&apos;s unrelated to its status as a boarding house. But I can&apos;t help thinking that the incredibly lax approach to (not) regulating housing for the vulnerable won&apos;t have helped. — Max Rashbrooke (@MaxRashbrooke) May 16, 2023 The people living there tolerated these appalling conditions because they had, as another resident put it, “nowhere else to go”. Whether it was alcoholism, poverty, difficult behaviour or other assorted conditions, no conventional private landlord would have them as a tenant. Social housing was in short supply. The tenants, some of whom had lived there for decades, enjoyed few legal protections. Boarding house tenants can be evicted with 48 hours’ notice on various grounds, including where the landlord claims they will cause “serious damage” to the property. Needless to say, such provisions are open to abuse, and help create a climate in which tenants feel frightened to speak up. Not that it would necessarily help if they did: when I tried I discovered the local council had virtually no legal powers to force improvements. Firefighters survey the roof after a fire at Loafers Lodge in Wellington Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images No one yet knows how the fire started at Loafers Lodge and it could be unrelated to its status as a boarding house. But there were, reportedly, warning signs. A nearby business owner, florist Laura Newcombe, told media she wasn’t surprised by the tragedy: “It’s just a maze in there.” One hospital worker said they “often used to think when I used to visit: God, if there’s a fire it’s like a rabbit warren.” Conflicting reports have also emerged from residents over whether alarms went off when the fire broke out. Fire and emergency said on Tuesday that they could not confirm whether alarms had gone off. Either way, Loafers Lodge shouldn’t bear all the blame. Wellington City Council has said that the lodge was issued with a Building Warrant of Fitness in March this year, indicating that it met minimum safety standards at the time. It has been widely reported that the building had no sprinkler system, but there is no legal requirement to retrofit older buildings with sprinklers – even when the presence of large numbers of vulnerable people, some of them cooking in their own rooms, creates a frightening fire hazard. For over a decade politicians have known the risks posed by such places and done nothing. Boarding-house owners are, in a peculiar sense, victims of a wider failure. It shouldn’t be their responsibility to care for such troubled people. The state should provide safe, secure accommodation, with wraparound public services available on-site. It is starting to do so, through initiatives like Housing First, but not yet at the required scale. And as long as vulnerable people live in private accommodation, tougher rules may be needed. It’s not yet clear exactly what could have saved those who died in the fire, but it’s not hard to imagine how closer regulatory attention – mandatory sprinklers, licensing regimes, a legal framework that ensures tenants feel safe speaking out – might have at least alleviated the tragedy. As it stands, all we have is grief, and a growing pile of unanswered questions. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Green Party co-leader James Shaw made clear his anger: “What kind of country are we, where those people have so few options in life but to live in substandard accommodation with a reasonable chance of lethality?” It’s a good question. It’s just a shame that only now, after people have died, will there be anything like sufficient investigation into the conditions in which they lived and whether those conditions contributed to their deaths.</body>

    <head>Brisbane Tigers announce bid for 18th NRL team licence</head>
    <body>The Brisbane Tigers, one of the oldest clubs in Australian rugby league, have launched a bid to become the NRL’s 18th team after opening a new $10m stadium on Wednesday. Having failed to become the league’s 17th team under the name of the Brisbane Firehawks in 2020, the Langlands Park-based club has renewed its interest in joining the four existing Queensland NRL franchises. Related: Dragons face significant overhaul if club is to emerge from NRL mediocrity | Nick Tedeschi “Our NRL bid will leverage our great club’s 90-year-old history of legendary players and coaches, premierships and Queensland spirit to become the go-to team of Queensland’s fastest growing region,” Tigers CEO Brian Torpy said. The Australian Rugby League Commission has indicated further expansion of the competition to 18 teams is just a matter of time and could happen as soon as 2027 or 2028. The club, known as Easts since 1933 before the Brisbane Tigers rebrand in 2020, hope to join fellow south-east Queensland teams the Dolphins, Broncos and Titans in the expanding competition. North Queensland is represented by the Cowboys. Should the Tigers win the NRL’s 18th licence, another change of name would be likely needed, to avoid a clash with the existing Wests Tigers. The Tigers’ bid chair, Shane Edwards, pointed to the initial success of the Dolphins, who are competing in their debut season this year, as reason to believe his club can step up and join the country’s premier rugby league competition. “With the strong attendance and audience figures we are seeing the Dolphins achieve in their debut year, we believe the Brisbane Tigers can provide a similar stimulus in the south-west corridor that takes in the Logan and Ipswich regions,” Edwards said. “If successful in becoming the 18th NRL team, our goal is to be the go-to club for sports fans on Brisbane’s south side and western corridor and the millions of casual fans between the ages of 18 to 34 who do not currently support the Broncos, Dolphins or Titans.” The Tigers’ new Totally Workwear Stadium was unveiled on Wednesday by Queensland’s tourism and sport minister, Stirling Hinchliffe, and rugby league great Des Morris, who opened his namesake grandstand. The redevelopment, to which the Queensland government contributed $1.1m, features a high performance and community centre and was hailed as “one of Australia’s best boutique, gender-inclusive rugby league stadiums”. “The change rooms and gymnasium are female-participant compliant and will encourage more women to play rugby league, providing more inclusive pathways to our BMD Premiership team,” Torpy said.</body>

    <head>George Santos: Democrats move to expel indicted Republican from Congress</head>
    <body>Democrats moved on Tuesday to expel George Santos from Congress. The New York Republican won election in November last year but his résumé has been shown to be largely made up and his campaign finances and past behaviour, some allegedly criminal, have been scrutinised in tremendous detail. Last week, federal prosecutors indicted Santos on multiple counts of wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and lying to Congress. Appearing in court on Long Island, he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be the victim of a political witch hunt. Related: George Santos, liar and fantasist, fits the Republican party just fine | Moira Donegan Now, House Democrats have triggered a political manoeuvre designed to force Republicans to either break with Santos or publicly vote to defend him. To succeed, a privileged resolution introduced by Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, must attract two-thirds support in the House. The resolution could come to a vote within two days. On Tuesday, Garcia told reporters: “The Republicans in the House are actually going to have to go on record and make a decision about if they’re actually going to stand for truth and accountability, or if they’re going to stand with someone that’s clearly a liar.” Some Republicans have said Santos should quit but as yet party leaders have not broken with him, saying he has a right to seek acquittal while representing his district. Republicans control the House by just five seats – and Democrats would be favoured to win Santos’s seat should it fall vacant. In January, amid a far-right rebellion, Santos supported Kevin McCarthy through 15 votes for speaker. Garcia also said Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic minority leader, was “involved” in the process. McCarthy told reporters he would talk to Jeffries about referring the resolution to the House ethics committee, which he hoped would “move rapidly” despite rarely doing so or imposing heavy punishments. Only five members of the House have ever been expelled. Three were kicked out for fighting for the Confederacy in the civil war. Two were expelled after being convicted of crimes. The last, James Traficant of Ohio, was expelled in 2002. Like Santos, Traficant cut a somewhat picaresque path through the halls of power. Reporting his death in 2014, the New York Times said Traficant was known for his “colorful personality and wardrobe, his legislative theatrics and his wild mop of hair. Related: ‘We’re living in madness’: George Santos’s constituents on federal charges “So it was something of a surprise when the hair turned out to be fake, a fact that was made clear when he had to remove his toupée during booking after his arrest on bribery and racketeering charges.” Traficant did not let his expulsion stop him running for re-election, as an independent and from federal custody in Pennsylvania. Though unsuccessful, he received more than 28,000 votes. Santos has announced a run for re-election. McCarthy has said he does not support such a move. On Tuesday, Garcia told MSNBC McCarthy had “lost all control of his caucus. He needs Santos for key votes on the on the deficit, on the budget, and so … he’s been working with literally a liar and a huge fraudster in the Congress. “So now McCarthy’s going to actually have to make a choice, if he will support George Santos … or if he’s actually going to listen to the American people. “And so we’re gonna continue to push this as best possible. We think it’s absolutely the right approach. And we’ve given plenty of time to George Santos to resign. We’ve been calling for his resignation for months and for months. It’s time for him to do the right thing.”</body>

    <head>New Mexico shooter roamed area with at least three guns, police say</head>
    <body>An 18-year-old man who stalked a New Mexico neighborhood, fatally shooting three people on Monday, armed himself with at least three guns, one of which was the style of powerful rifle used during many mass shootings, officials said, renewing calls for legislation to combat gun violence. The attack, which also left six people injured, came as the US is poised to see its worst year in recent history for mass killings. Police named the three dead victims as 97-year-old Gwendolyn Schofield, her 73-year-old daughter, Melody Ivie, and 79-year-old Shirley Voita. Related: New Mexico shooting leaves three people dead and nine injured The deadly shooting erupted about 11am local time in Farmington, a city of about 50,000. “The suspect roamed throughout the neighborhood, up to a quarter of a mile,” Farmington’s police chief, Steve Hebbe, said. Authorities also named the shooter as local 18-year-old high school student Beau Wilson, but added they were still trying to determine a motive for the attack. Wilson lived in the Farmington neighborhood where he opened fire. Farmington’s deputy police chief, Kyle Dowdy, said there was nothing yet leading investigators to believe Wilson knew any of the people he shot. “We’re pretty confident in that is was completely random,” he said. Wilson legally purchased at least one of the guns he used in November. Witnesses and police say Wilson walked through the neighborhood spraying bullets until police arrived within minutes and fatally shot him. Two police officers were among the wounded, and were treated and released from the hospital. “The amount of violence and brutality that these people faced is unconscionable to me,” Dowdy said. The gunman shot at least six houses and three cars during the attack. Authorities said the gunman did not target any particular location – such as a school or church – nor people during the shooting. Among the dead was Voita, a 79-year-old woman who had worked as a nurse and was a devoted parishioner at Sacred Heart Catholic church, said former state lawmaker James Strickler, who was her friend. “She was just a dynamite lady. She was well-loved, and I’m still shocked over it,” said Strickler, who heard gunfire on Monday before learning the circumstances of Voita’s death. Some of the shootings were captured on video that was uploaded to TikTok, which police confirmed was authentic. The footage shows a man clad in black clothes pacing near a driveway outside the First Church of Christ, Scientist, with an apparent handgun. Later, the footage shows him being shot by police. Neighborhood resident Joseph Robledo, 32, hurried home after hearing that his wife and one-year-old daughter hid in their laundry room during the gunfire. A bullet went through his baby’s room and its window, but did not strike anyone. An older woman was in the street in front of his house. She had been shot while driving by and appeared to have fallen out of her vehicle, which kept going without her, Robledo said. “I went out to see because the lady was just lying in the road, and to figure just what the heck was going on,” Robledo reportedly said. As he and others provided first aid, neighbors told a police officer where the shooter was. The middle-school teacher Nick Atkins, who lives on a street locked down by police, said the neighborhood is largely calm. “You never think it’s going to happen here, and all of a sudden, in a tiny little town, it comes here,” Atkins reportedly said. After the shooting, New Mexico’s congressional delegation issued a statement that read: “One thing is clear: Congress needs to act on gun violence NOW.” The statement alluded to how the federal government last year enacted bipartisan congressional legislation that expanded background checks for the youngest gun buyers while funding mental health and violence intervention programs. But, the statement added, Monday was “a painful reminder that we must do more”. “We are committed to fighting for sensible gun safety measures that will keep New Mexicans safe,” the statement said.

    <head>Australian wages rise again but still lag behind cost of living, March quarter figures reveal</head>
    <body>Australia’s workers saw their wages rise at a quickening rate in the March quarter but the pace still fell far short of cost-of-living increases. The March quarter wage price index rose to an annual rate of 3.7% in the first three months of 2023, from 3.3% in the December quarter. Economists had expected it to increase 3.6%. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The advance, though, compared with headline annual consumer inflation in the March quarter of 7%, with the underlying rate at 6.6%. Wage price index for March came in at an annual (seasonally adjusted) rate of 3.7%, @ABSStats says. That&apos;s the highest since the September quarter of 2012. pic.twitter.com/o9GKFRliUl — @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) May 17, 2023 Leigh Merrington, the acting head of prices statistics at the Australian Bureau of Statistics, said the seasonally adjusted increase was the most in just over a decade and reflected “low unemployment, a tight labour market and high inflation”. Private sector employees saw their pay packets swell 3.8% in the year, and 0.8% in the quarter alone, in line with the average advance. Those working in the public sector notched up a 3% annual increase – the most since 2012 – and 0.9% for the quarter alone. The dollar was slightly lower on the news while the stock market was little moved after losing about 0.5% in morning trading. Related: Stage-three tax cuts cost blowout predicted, with men and the wealthy to benefit most The WPI figure will be closely scrutinised by the Reserve Bank for its impact on its interest rate course, and by unions and others concerned that wages are still in retreat when inflation is taken into account. According to the 2023-24 federal budget, workers should start to enjoy wages growing faster than the inflation rate by early 2024, or slightly sooner than expected by the October budget. That would mark the first real increase in three years, and by the June quarter reach a 0.75% annual pace, “helping to drive the recovery in domestic activity through 2024-25”, the budget said. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said that while the increase was welcome, real wages still went backwards at about 3.3% in the past 12 months. “Wage growth is clearly not contributing to inflation,” she said. “Any increases over the past year have been swallowed up by price rises, rent rises and interest rate rises.” McManus said the Fair Work Commission needed to consider “this harsh reality in deciding minimum wages and award wages”. Belinda Allen, a senior CBA economist said there were signs public sector salary growth was accelerating. “We expect stronger public sector wages to continue over coming quarters as long‑standing wage caps are lifted and enterprise-bargaining agreements are reset at higher rates of pay as they expire,” Allen said. By contrast, there were signs private sector wages growth could be plateauing, with the pace apparently peaking on a quarterly basis in the September quarter of last year. “We do expect the labour market to show further signs of loosening from here due to the large lift in supply of labour and as the economy slows,” she said. Before today’s numbers, investors were rating the chance of a 12th interest rate rise since last May as very unlikely, although the prospect of an August rate hike was nearing a 50-50 chance. As inflation retreats from three-decade highs, the share of employees reporting bigger wage increases in the past year, compared to the year before, has risen to almost 60%. That’s the largest share since the ABS began collecting such numbers in 2003. From the March quarter wages info, the proportion of those reporting a bigger increase than a year earlier has climbed to about 60%, or the highest since the series began two decades ago. (Source: @ABSStats ) pic.twitter.com/HIs8L16MUn — @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) May 17, 2023 The proportion of those reporting increasing by 4-6% from a year ago now make up almost one-in-four workers. That’s the largest share of the market since 2009. Those eking out increases of less than 2% are down to about 18.6%, down from more than 50% about two years ago. Western Australia reported the biggest increases in wages. New South Wales and Victoria, the two most populous states, both posted a 3.5% annual change, or less than the national average. WA led wage increases in the past quarter and the past year, @abss says. pic.twitter.com/JCZ0mmGHPL — @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) May 17, 2023 Sean Langcake, the head of macroeconomic forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia, said the “remarkably tight labour market has delivered relatively brisk wage growth over the past four quarters”. “Looking ahead, quarterly outcomes are likely to stay within this range while the unemployment rate is below 4%,” Langcake said. The ABS will release April labour market numbers on Thursday, with economists expecting a similar reading as March’s near half century-low of 3.5% jobless rate. April CPI data will land on 31 May.</body>

    <head>Dianne Feinstein: oldest serving senator says she ‘hasn’t been gone’ despite absence</head>
    <body>A bizarre exchange with reporters has raised new questions about the return of Dianne Feinstein, California’s senior senator who has been absent from Washington for months due to shingles. Jim Newell, a reporter for Slate, ran into Feinstein shortly after the 89-year-old lawmaker voted on the Senate floor on Tuesday. When he and another journalist asked Feinstein how she has been received by her colleagues since returning to Washington, Feinstein appeared to insist that she had never left. Related: AOC says Feinstein’s refusal to retire is ‘causing great harm’ to US courts “I haven’t been gone. I’ve been working,” Feinstein told Newell and another reporter, according to a Slate article published Tuesday. She was asked if she meant she had been working remotely, to which Feinstein responded: “No, I’ve been here. I’ve been voting. Please. You either know or don’t know.” The exchange comes as Feinstein faces pressure to resign amid questions about her health. Now the oldest serving senator, Feinstein led the effort to pass a landmark 1994 assault weapons ban and fought for a full investigation of the CIA’s detention and interrogation program. But in recent years, media and Feinstein’s colleagues have increasingly questioned her fitness to serve as one of two senators representing the most populous US state. Her three-month absence from the Senate judiciary committee this year threatened to derail the confirmation of Joe Biden’s judicial nominees, at a time when 9% of district and appellate court seats remain vacant. And while Feinstein has managed to fulfil her committee duties since returning to Washington, questions remain about whether she can effectively govern. A San Francisco Chronicle report last year described Feinstein suffering memory losses and relying heavily on her staff to fulfil job duties. The senator has said that doctors have asked her to maintain a lighter work schedule as she continues to recover, but has provided no details on what that means. She has continually dismissed reporters’ questions about her health and workload. Some fellow Democrats, including the California representative Ro Khanna, have called on her to resign. “Three months is a long time to be absent without any clarity,” he told Politico. Feinstein has said she wouldn’t seek re-election in 2024. Three California representatives – Adam Schiff, Katie Porter, and Barbara Lee – have already declared their candidacy. If Feinstein does decide to retire early, it would fall to Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, to appoint a temporary replacement. Still, because Feinstein holds seniority after 30 years of service in the Senate, if she did step down, her replacement would not automatically wield the same authority she does on the judiciary committee and the powerful appropriations committee. The situation has rankled Californians who had called for Feinstein to step down earlier, before this term.</body>

    <head>High-profile Queensland rape accused seeks information from alleged victim’s phone</head>
    <body>Lawyers for a high-profile man accused of rape are seeking access to information from his alleged victim’s phone, as well as the results of a forensic medical officer’s report. The man, who is charged with two counts of raping a young woman in Toowoomba in October 2021, cannot be named under Queensland law. He has been on bail since the matter was first mentioned in court in January and has been represented by his lawyer, Rowan King, who on Wednesday morning appeared by phone before the Toowoomba magistrates court for a committal hearing. Crown prosecutor Sally Dreghorn sought a six-week adjournment of proceedings as her team worked to meet a disclosure request by the defence. That consisted of a forensic medical officer’s report conducted after the alleged sexual assault. It also included data obtained from the woman’s phone by police using the Israeli company Cellebrite. The case was adjourned until 28 June at which point Dreghorn said prosecutors would either be in a position to meet the disclosure requests or advise the court when that next step “might be due”. King was again granted leave to represent the defendant by phone at the next hearing unless “anything substantive” arises. Under current laws, a person accused in Queensland of serious sexual offences must be committed to stand trial before they can be named publicly. The state is one of the last jurisdictions to retain this law, which the attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, has flagged will be changed this year. A joint bid by a conglomeration of media companies which sought leave to name the accused man was rejected by the court in February as premature.</body>

    <head>International education providers ‘gaming the system’ undermine Australia’s reputation, inquiry hears</head>
    <body>The vocational education and training (VET) sector’s reputation will be destroyed if urgent action isn’t taken to clean up malpractice among international education providers, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. In the past weeks, the committee has heard of providers working with unregulated international education agents to steal students from prestigious public institutions for massive commissions, sell work visas and open “ghost schools” where students don’t attend classes and get handed degrees. Labor MP Julian Hill told the inquiry on Tuesday the behaviour of the “bottom end” of providers was harming students and causing reputational damage but could also “destroy the social licence” of the sector if it wasn’t cleaned up. Related: Australians who lost welfare under 1990s student loan scheme have cause for class action, expert says “I couldn’t put it more clearly … if we don’t act more urgently, the community will start to turn on this sector … we’ve got to deal with this,” he said. “Year after year, nothing seems to happen. Home affairs isn’t even enforcing the current rules, let alone new rules. “All the evidence we get is you don’t regulate quality, you regulate the ecosystem around the provider, police paperwork, you have no line of sight to the quality of the graduates which are being produced from these institutes.” About 180,000 international students are enrolled in the training sector across about 900 providers, regulated by the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA). Its CEO, Saxon Rice, told the inquiry the body was “acutely aware” of the risks of poor practices but conceded the current regulatory model didn’t assess the quality of teaching and graduate outcomes, instead focusing on individual provider risk. Since July 2022, ASQA has received 470 complaints and intelligence about training providers. In the same time period, just seven have had their registrations cancelled or suspended. A former teacher who taught English at a private educational institute with campuses across Australia for about six months told Guardian Australia the school was using educational agents to funnel international students into courses with dated textbooks, improper accreditation, substandard teachers and filthy classrooms, at a cost of about $1,000 a month. The education agents were housed in the same building, on the same floor of his workplace. “I could see from the inside how unethical the entire operation is,” he said, in comments separate to the inquiry. “The agents act as the sketchy middle point … they find students – friends, friends of friends, and shuffle them to Australian offices who shuffle them to the courses. “They’re not concerned about the quality of the course, they just take a massive cut. It’s a win-win but not for students because these courses are exorbitant.” The institute is accredited by ASQA and promises pathways to affiliated public universities on its website. It has received multiple formal complaints. He said they were provided with material from 20 years ago and forced to teach in overcrowded classrooms that still had plastic wrap on the seats. He received no training and didn’t have his credentials verified, claiming other teachers had poor English skills and dealt with a revolving door of managers. “Sometimes students had no access to textbooks. We were given two pages to teach a four-hour class,” he said. “The test every week seemed to come from some random website, and they were reused so it was easy to cheat,” he said. Menelaos Koumides, managing director of the Australian Academy of Vocational Education and Trades, told the inquiry the current regulatory system was failing. “We see institutes that we think really should not be here … they’re highly competent in licensing requirements [and they’re] gaming the system,” he said. Related: GPs aiding international student agents to exploit Australian visa ‘loophole’, inquiry hears “What is severely lacking in this industry, which is actually fundamental, is to hold registered trading organisations accountable by having independent assessments … and to make these transparent. “[There are] blow-outs in agent’s commissions … 98% of students are going through agents … these are all consequences of a regulatory system … that was never fit for purpose.” Koumides said students were receiving automatic passes with minimum study requirements. “It’s not fit for purpose when it comes to quality, it never was.”</body>

    <head>North Carolina bans abortion at 12 weeks, overriding Democratic governor’s veto</head>
    <body>North Carolina has passed legislation banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy after the state’s Republican-controlled general assembly successfully overrode the Democratic governor’s veto Tuesday evening. The house completed the second and final part of the override with a vote of 72-48. The move is expected to deal a fresh blow to one of the last bastions of abortion access in the south, which has been significantly curtailed after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, had honored a vow he made to North Carolinians to protect reproductive rights by vetoing SB 20 during a public rally in Raleigh on Saturday, which was attended by thousands. But in separate votes Tuesday, the state senate and house cleared the path to put new restrictions into place. Cooper condemned the decision to override his veto and move forward with the ban, and said he would do “everything I can to protect abortion access in North Carolina because women’s lives depend on it”. Gov. Cooper Statement on Republican vote to override SB20 veto: pic.twitter.com/Kh06weg4zQ — Governor Roy Cooper (@NC_Governor) May 17, 2023 Related: Texas man kills girlfriend after she had an abortion in Colorado Last week, Republicans had rushed the bill through the house, drawing criticism from other legislators and abortion rights advocates. The 46-page bill, in addition to banning abortion after 12 weeks, extends the waiting period for people seeking abortions to 72 hours, requires providers to send sensitive information to the state department of health and human services, and requires clinics to obtain special licensing that would result in clinic closures throughout the state. The new restrictions pose grave concerns for abortion providers, who have already witnessed a sharp uptick in patients traveling to North Carolina for abortion care after Roe v Wade was overturned. Advocates who foresaw the overturning of the governor’s veto of SB 20 sprang into action in the days following the legislative decision, hoping to sway lawmakers who showed support for reproductive rights in the past, like Tricia Cotham, a representative who handed house Republicans a supermajority after switching parties last month. In recent days, Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic launched a television ad campaign reminding viewers of Republican state representative Ted Davis’s promise to uphold North Carolina’s 20-week ban. The group also supported Governor Cooper’s efforts to reach constituents and providers in Mecklenburg, Guilford and New Hanover counties last week during a series of round tables. At each talk, the governor informed constituents about the contents of the bill. Cooper also called out Republican lawmakers in the state who had previously said they would protect abortion access in the state. One-third of North Carolina patients seeking abortions since the supreme court decision come from outside the state, Planned Parenthood estimates. One report shows the number of people traveling to North Carolina for abortion care spiked by 37% as restrictions tightened in neighboring southern states since last summer. Others show an average increase of 788 patients monthly after the supreme court’s decision. Agencies contributed to this report</body>

    <head>Neither Chris galvanises support as New Zealand voters shun major parties</head>
    <body>New Zealand’s two major parties have had a pretty good run of it. Other countries proportional election systems have seen established parties humbled and fractured. Israel’s once-mighty Labor party is now a minnow. In Germany the two large, old parties controlled less than half of the vote at the last election. Meanwhile Aotearoa’s two big beasts – centre-left Labour and centre-right National – have received the votes of more than 70% of the country in the past six elections. Indeed, Jacinda Ardern won Labour half of the entire vote at the last election, a feat no UK politician has managed since before the second world war. Related: New Zealand Labour minister suddenly defects to Māori party Yet with Ardern gone and both parties led by white men named Chris, New Zealand seems to be falling a bit out of love with the major parties. Just five months before the election neither party is able to command much more than a third of the vote. The exact lack of love varies by polling company. Roy Morgan’s last poll – conducted throughout April – had just 62% of voters backing either Labour or National. The two private pollsters who both of the main parties trust each had them at a combined 69% in their May polls. And a Newshub/Reid Research poll released in the last few days had them at a more healthy 71%. More striking is the fact that both parties are victims. At other points when the combined vote dropped sharply, it was because one of the two parties was in major turmoil, so voters on a single side of politics were searching for alternatives. See 2002, when National collapsed, or 2014 when Labour did. Now both parties have mediocre figures. The main beneficiaries of this drop have been two smaller parties which have long flanked the major parties on each side. The ACT party, to National’s right on the economy and most culture war issues, now comfortably controls a bit more than 10% of the vote, meaning there is no real chance of a right-wing government happening without it enabling it. The Greens, to Labour’s left on the environment, economy, and every culture war issue, control just under 10%, meaning its chance of being locked out of a left-wing government is similarly slim. And throwing a real firework in the mix is Te Pāti Māori, an Indigenous rights party formed out of a split with Labour in the early 2000s that just stole a minister from the governing party. This party has now made a definitive turn to the left of politics, and an increasing chunk of voters are backing it. These three smaller parties will play a huge role in the next election, and at least one of them will be a big part of the next government. New Zealand has seen many coalition governments before – but since 2002 these have always featured some sort of centrist party support. Either coalition this time will feature a party that wants the country to go strongly further to the left or right, and likely no tempering voice from the centre. So why are we seeing this cratering of support for both the main parties? Locally, there are plenty of good reasons for voters who really believe in something to ditch one of the main two parties. Labour have governed largely from the centre side of the centre-left, leaving climate hawks and socialists to swing to the Greens, and have left policy space on Indigenous issues for Te Pāti Māori, which can also rely on left-populist standbys like removing the GST from food. When last in government, National failed to roll back the clock on major Labour policies like KiwiSaver and Working For Families, and in opposition backed the government’s gun reforms after the 15 March attack, which has left space for ACT to thrive. Internationally, New Zealand is hardly alone. UK Labour were triumphant in the recent local elections but netted only about 35% of the actual vote – the Tories are floundering but Keir Starmer doesn’t seem able to quite light the match. Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese handily won the last election but with less than a third of first-preference votes. Even the US, deeply wedded to the two-party system, has huge numbers of voters pushing for a third party. There appears to be a post-pandemic malaise harming the major parties. While locked away in their homes a lot of people got a lot more political, forming incredibly strong feelings about things like mask use and social justice, on both sides. These people have not necessarily exited the pandemic radicalised beyond belief, but it does seem that smaller parties on the left and right of the classic “big two” have benefited. But smaller parties have had big rises in New Zealand polling before – most notably in the chaotic early 1990s. Whether they solidify this rise into a new normal is yet to be seen.</body>

    <head>Republican who expanded Kentucky voting opportunities wins primary</head>
    <body>Kentucky’s Republican secretary of state, who had earned widespread praise for increasing his state’s voter turnout during the coronavirus pandemic and for expanding opportunities to vote, won his primary on Tuesday. Michael Adams faced a primary challenge from two Republicans who align themselves with the growing faction within the GOP who believe elections are frequently rigged and stolen. Adams will now face Buddy Wheatley, a Democrat and former state representative, in November. During his time in office, Adams has shot down conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and defended his state’s election system from claims of fraud, a stance that he said earlier this week could cost him his job. In an interview, Adams said it would “absolutely” be worth it if he lost the race to have defended and expanded Kentucky’s elections, but he was hopeful that Kentucky Republicans understood the ways his reforms had benefited them. “I’m not surprised that I have a primary, but I also think in my gut that if these Republicans utilized early voting and absentee voting, then they’re not going to hold it against me that I implemented those things,” he said. The race marks the latest in what is likely to be a long series of primary contests in which more moderate, mainstream Republicans are challenged by candidates to their right who are allied with Trump and who deny the results of the 2020 election. “There won’t be a GOP primary that doesn’t have election denialism as part of it,” said Ben Ginsberg, a conservative elections lawyer, at a recent conference for election officials in Washington DC. Related: ‘Impossible to hold him accountable’: DeSantis signs laws to ease 2024 run The Republicans challenging Adams were Stephen Knipper, an information technology project manager who has twice run unsuccessfully for secretary of state, and Allen Maricle, a former state legislator. Knipper is endorsed by Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO, who has spread conspiracy theories about Trump winning the 2020 election. Knipper has also said he has serious doubts about the 2019 victory of Kentucky’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, and alleges that voting machines were hacked. Maricle has said he disagrees that the state’s elections are rigged, but he has maintained that voter fraud affects them. Both challengers wanted Kentucky to join the eight states that have recently left the Electronic Registration Information Center (Eric), a national database used by a majority of states to compare voter rolls and keep them accurate. Fueled by false claims and conspiracy theories about the network’s ties to the liberal donor George Soros, Republicans who once praised Eric now claim it does not protect election integrity. Adams has defended Kentucky’s participation in Eric and has said Kentucky will remain a member as long as it is beneficial and worth the dues. “Prior to the last couple of months,” when critical states have pulled out, “Eric has been a godsend for us in helping us get people off the rolls,” he said. Since taking office in 2020, Adams has worked with Beshear and the GOP-controlled legislature to expand absentee and early voting. During the height of the pandemic, he worked to open countywide polling supercenters in large venues. The work helped Kentucky see a primary turnout record in 2020 and earned him praise from Democrats. Adams said his biggest reason for running was to protect the expansions he has made to voting. “I do think if I get beat, that will send a message to other Republicans in the legislature, especially, that doing things the way I’ve done them is bad politics, and I’m afraid they’ll dismantle expanded voting and absentee voting for political reasons.” That desire overpowers his reluctance to continue serving in a job he calls “miserable” given the environment of threats and harassment for election officials. “I didn’t especially want to run again,” he added, “but I felt like I had to do it to protect what we’ve done.”</body>

    <head>Biden cancels Australia and Papua New Guinea visit as debt limit crisis looms</head>
    <body>Joe Biden has cancelled a planned visit to Australia and Papua New Guinea to focus on debt limit talks as Washington stares into the abyss of a potentially catastrophic default. Biden still plans to head to Hiroshima, Japan, on Wednesday for the Group of Seven (G7) summit with leaders from some of the world’s leading economies. But he called off what was to be the first visit by a sitting US president to Papua New Guinea and a stop in Australia, where he was to meet with other leaders of the so-called Quad. The move came as Biden hosted a fresh round of talks with congressional leaders at the White House in an effort to break the deadlock – and faced criticism from his left flank over rumored concessions to Republicans. Although the meeting ended in less than an hour, there were expressions of cautious optimism from both sides. Republican Kevin McCarthy, speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters: “I think we set the stage to carry on further conversations … We’ve got a lot of work to do in a short amount of time.” McCarthy acknowledged the two sides were still far apart but added: “It is possible to get a deal by the end of the week. It’s not that difficult to get to an agreement.” Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, said: “It was a good and productive meeting. Everyone agreed that default would be the worst outcome – a horrible situation for America and America’s families.” The leaders have just 15 days to strike a deal to raise the US government’s $31.4tn debt ceiling and avert the first default in the country’s history. The treasury department on Monday reiterated its warning that it could run short of money to pay all its bills as soon as 1 June, which would trigger a default that economists say would be likely to cause a calamity while delighting geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia. Related: What is the US debt ceiling and what will happen if it is not raised? More than 8 million people could lose their jobs, officials estimate. Millions of social security beneficiaries, veterans and military families could lose their monthly payments. Vital federal services including border and air traffic control could be disrupted if workers cannot get their government wages. Ilhan Omar, a Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, told the Guardian: “It would plunge a lot of American families into economic depression. It would create an economic crisis not just in the United States but globally. “We have to be able to keep our promise and pay our bills and then we can come back and obviously negotiate a budget that can be agreed upon by both parties. But to hold our economy hostage on a wishlist that creates economic devastation for so many of the people that we represent is just unthinkable, cruel and dangerously stupid.” Republicans, who control the House of Representatives by a 222-213 majority, have for months demanded that any increase in the government’s self-imposed borrowing cap be linked to spending cuts. Last month they narrowly passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling while cutting spending by nearly 14% over a decade. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, speaks outside the Oval Office after speaking with Joe Biden on debt ceiling negotiations at the White House on Tuesday. Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Shutterstock In the past week Biden and McCarthy’s aides have reportedly discussed issues including spending caps, tightening work requirements for food and other benefit programs for low-income Americans and changes to energy permitting in exchange for votes to lift the limit. This worries some Democrats, particularly on the left. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, tweeted on Tuesday: “Democrats cannot give ground on work requirements in the debt ceiling talks. All work requirements do is limit the availability of food aid for families and hurt poor, marginalized communities – the very people we were elected to defend.” John Fetterman, a Democratic senator for Pennsylvania, said in a statement: “I sure didn’t come to Washington to take vital assistance away from working people at the same time big bank CEOs nearly crash the economy and get to jet off to Hawaii scot-free.” Officially, the White House has repeatedly insisted that Republicans must rule out default and consider budget issues separate from the need to raise the nation’s debt limit, which it describes as Congress’s constitutional duty. But some observers suspect its real position is less clear cut. Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: “If this crisis is to be resolved, it will be resolved through a spending deal that will be linked in some way to the debt ceiling and I have sense – I can’t prove it – that Rubicon has already been crossed.” A similar standoff in 2011 between Barack Obama and a new generation of Tea Party House Republicans led to a historic downgrade of the US’s credit rating, which sparked a selloff in stocks and pushed its borrowing costs higher. Some Democrats argue that Obama made compromises he later regretted and Biden, vice-president at the time, should avoid a repeat. The current impasse has rattled investors, sending the cost of insuring exposure to US government debt to record highs. Adding to the challenge of striking a deal, McCarthy agreed to a change in House rules that allows for just one member to call for his ouster as speaker, which gives greater power to hardliners, including the roughly three dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus. William Howell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said: “The Republicans consist of a lot of different factions. There are some who are fiscal conservatives who are generally concerned about the debt and excessive spending and there are some, particularly the populist wing of the party, that’s interested in just blowing things up. For them, the disruption and the defiance and is politically advantageous. “For Biden to find a productive way forward, he doesn’t have to get all the Republicans. He’s going to have to get some of them. The question is, to the extent that he needs Republican support, who can he win over?”</body>

    <head>Australian pharmacy losses predicted to total $1.2bn over four years under Labor prescription reforms</head>
    <body>Pharmacies could lose more than $150,000 each annually over the coming years under Labor reforms that reduce the cost of many prescription medicines, the government’s analysis shows. The government says allowing people to buy two months’ worth of medicine for the price of a one-month prescription will save patients up to $180 a year for each medicine. Related: Pharmacists claim children at risk of overdose under Labor’s two-for-one prescription changes But the Pharmacy Guild has been scathing about the government’s plans, claiming they will lead to medicine shortages and children overdosing. Costings prepared by the Office Of Impact Analysis, which assesses any regulatory change, gives insight into the finances at the heart of the fight. The OIA estimates individual pharmacies could lose up to $49,000 in the first year of the change, increasing to $158,000 in the fourth year. Pharmacies will in total lose about $1.2bn over the first four years, the costings estimate. The OIA modelled the loss of revenue on the reduction in government payments to pharmacies under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, including dispensing and handling fees. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The health minister, Mark Butler, has repeatedly said the money saved will be reinvested in community pharmacies, and has strongly disputed the Pharmacy Guild’s claims on medicine shortages and overdoses. “Every dollar that the commonwealth will save from this measure will be reinvested back into new spending on community pharmacy programs,” he said when announcing the change last month. The reforms will apply to about 300 common medicines listed on the PBS and will be implemented in three tranches from 1 September. The government estimates it will save patients $1.6bn over the next four years and the move has been embraced by doctors, who say it will also help to free up GP appointments. The OIA also modelled a policy to allow three months of medicine to be purchased for the price of one script. This would would have cut revenue for individual pharmacies by an estimated $210,000 in the fourth year. That model was rejected by the government. The OIA also looked at the benefit to patients, citing research that one in five Australians aged 16 to 24 found prescription medication to be unaffordable, with more than 770,000 Australians delaying or not filling their scripts because of cost concerns in 2021-22. “The proportion of people who delayed or did not get prescription medication when needed due to cost increased to 5.6% in 2021-22, from 4.4% in 2020-21,” the OIA reported. Related: Two-for-one prescription changes to save Australian patients more than $1.6bn “In addition, those Australians with a long-term health condition were more likely to delay or not get prescription medication dispensed due to cost than those without a long term health condition – 6.4% compared to 3.8%.” The Pharmacy Guild and pharmacies have vowed to continue to fight the changes, saying it will send businesses “to the wall”, particularly in smaller and regional communities. Butler says there will be “additional support” to pharmacies in rural communities, including doubling the rural maintenance allowance in rural areas to help offset revenue pressures, with $80m set aside in the budget for that purpose over the next four years. Nearly $650m over the next four years has been set aside for community pharmacy programs, with the promise of committed ongoing funding, with additional funding provided for community pharmacy vaccination programs.</body>

    <head>California police seek assailant who severed homeless man’s hand with sword</head>
    <body>Police in Riverside, California, reportedly thought the detached hand residents had reported seeing on the sidewalk was a movie prop. Then they learned that someone was being treated for a severed hand. Related: Video shows Walgreens guard killing trans organizer Banko Brown as he left store The man in the hospital said that he had been injured by someone wielding a sword on Saturday night, officer Ryan Railsback, a spokesperson for the Riverside police, said in a statement to the Guardian. Investigators with the police department’s robbery-homicide unit have yet to arrest anyone in the incident in Riverside, a city about 50 miles south-east of Los Angeles, but say it appears that the victim and assailant were both homeless and may have known one another. The victim, who Railsback says is in his 60s, came into a local hospital on Saturday with a missing hand. Later that evening police responded to calls about a severed hand lying near an overturned shopping cart on a downtown street. The victim is expected to survive, officials said. The perpetrator of the attack is still at large. The man injured in the Riverside attack is well-known in the community and liked by those who live and work in the downtown area, according to a GoFundMe set up to raise funds for the victim’s recovery. “We fear he will not have a safe and clean place to recover after being released,” the page reads. Though the specifics of the victim and assailant’s relationship remain unclear, the attack comes amid growing concerns about violence against unhoused people in US cities. A former San Francisco fire commissioner has also been accused of spraying several homeless people with bear mace. In nearby Los Angeles, violence against homeless residents has increased in recent years, unhoused people accounting for 24% of the city’s homicide victims despite making up just 1% of the population, NBC Los Angeles reported in January of this year.</body>

    <head>‘You have no security’: the households affected by no-fault evictions</head>
    <body>The government promised to ban no-fault evictions in its 2019 election manifesto and a renters reform bill was included in the December 2019 Queen’s speech, but it never materialised, until this week. In the meantime thousands of households have been evicted after being served a section 21 notice, which the new renters reform bill finally proposes to ban. Among them is Chiara Daughtry, 33, a teacher in Walthamstow, London, who was issued with a no-fault eviction notice in January after complaining about long-term damp problems and refusing a 24% rent rise at the two bedroom flat she shares with her husband, Ben, and their three-year-old daughter, Maggie. Despite paying £1,250 a month, the flat was plagued by rotten wooden sash windows letting water in, damp coming from a waterlogged cellar below and water coming in through air bricks. Council inspectors came to see the problems on several occasions, but nothing was fixed and on Christmas Eve, the letting agent said the landlord wanted to increase the rent to £1,550. Daughtry wrote saying “we won’t be paying any increase until you address the issues” and the next communication the family received from the landlord was a section 21 notice, she said. “It was really distressing and really upsetting,” she added. “You have no security as a renter here. We are a family. We don’t want to move every year or two years. It felt very unfair as a teacher working hard. And there are zero consequences for the letting agent or the landlord.” She said she feared that removing no-fault evictions would not end the problem and that landlords would be able to manipulate other grounds for evictions in the absence of more resources for council housing officials to carry out checks. She also said continuing short-term tenancies means landlords could use renewal dates to force people out. “I am not hopeful things will improve immediately,” she said. “They need to put money into the councils for us to see a change.” David Martin and his partner, Samira, who were evicted from their rental property in Richmond, North Yorkshire after complaining to their landlord about damp and mould. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian David Martin, 34, a sales manager, and his partner, Samira, 30, live in Rishi Sunak’s constituency of Richmond, North Yorkshire. In January 2021 the couple moved into a £625-a-month two-bedroom privately rented terrace house, but just 24 hours later they were horrified to see damp appearing. That was the start of a two-year battle with mould which spread throughout the house. Martin complained repeatedly, and in November 2022, when Samira was five months pregnant, the landlord served a section 21 eviction notice. Since then, Martin has written to Sunak and complained to local environmental health officials who issued an improvement notice on the property. Now the couple has found a new property – a two-bedroom bungalow in the town. “The whole process of not having somewhere secure for the baby has been really stressful,” he said. “Practically, financially and emotionally, it’s had a massive impact. I think there’s quite a lot of things wrong with the rental market. It seems that a landlord can get away with not fixing things in the property, not upholding their end of the contract, but as soon as a renter doesn’t pay their rent, they’re worse than mud. I think something like a register for landlords would make sense, because if we have to have all these background checks on us, why don’t the landlords have to have the same thing?” He said a ban on section 21 evictions will “give renters more security and balance of power”. “At the moment in the rental market landlords cannot fix things, but as soon as you don’t have your rent, boom, you’re in trouble,” he said. “I was having to pay rent for a property that was not fit for human habitation.” He added that the current situation was “not good for the economy” citing the risk that stress for renters can cause illness, time off work and taxes not being paid. The executive assistant Jazmyn Sadri, 28, has been evicted from studio flats in London four times in five years. Three times it happened when the landlords increased the rent by an unaffordable amount and once when a landlord issued a no-fault eviction notice, which turned out to be falsified. Three of the homes did not have reliable heating. “The bill is meaningless,” she said. “In my experience, section 21 isn’t how landlords are evicting people. They are raising the rent to an amount you can’t afford, which happened to me almost every time. The impact of the legislation could be negligible to me. There needs to be a limit on how much you can raise the rent. “I got evicted and then I would see my home on Rightmove for £200 to £300 a month more.” The same kind of studio flat she was paying £1,000 a month for now rents for £1,500, she said. “You can’t plan far ahead,” she said. “You don’t know where you are going to be based in six months. And it’s expensive to move – I am in debt and it’s moving costs.”</body>

    <head>Bus fares: £2 cap in England extended to end of October</head>
    <body>Bus passengers in England will be able to keep travelling for £2 after the government extended funding by another £500m, easing fears about a further decline in local services. The fare cap on most local buses, brought in as a temporary measure last year to boost patronage, will be extended until the end of October and then for another 13 months at £2.50 for a single journey, in a move that the Department for Transport said would support people with the cost of living and ensure stability in the sector. Bus operators, who had warned that up to 15% of routes could be lost when existing funding was due to run out at the end of June, welcomed the news but said it would not be enough to save every service. Covid recovery grants, a subsidy to address the continued shortfall in passenger numbers, were also set to expire next month. The fare cap scheme, which is supported by the biggest operators, will cost about £200m, while the government will also commit another £300m in funding for bus services until 2025. The government said it would review the effectiveness of the fare cap, which cuts some fares in England outside London by more than 80%, at the end of 2024, when a general election is expected to take place. The average single adult bus fare would otherwise be £2.80. Fares for adults in London are £1.75, while £2 caps have been launched in Greater Manchester, Liverpool and West Yorkshire under metro mayors. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: “By extending the £2 fare cap, we’re making sure bus travel remains accessible and affordable for everyone, while helping to ease cost of living pressures. “Buses connect our communities and play a vital role in growing the economy; they transport people to work, take our kids to school and make sure patients can get to doctors’ appointments. That’s why we’re determined to protect local routes and encourage more people on to the bus, ensuring people can get around easily and in an affordable way.” The transport secretary, Mark Harper, said the investment would help “continue to level up transport in all parts of the country, doing our bit to help halve inflation and grow the economy”. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, representing bus operators, said the two-year funding settlement recognised the value of buses. Its chief executive, Graham Vidler, said: “It will enable bus operators and local authorities to plan, promote and grow services with greater confidence. “However, the combination of the funding settlement and the £2 fare cap extension will not save every service in every part of the country. Operators and local authorities will now work together to study the detail of the government’s proposals and ensure that the funding is used to safeguard the best possible network for local passengers.” The CPT has sounded repeated warnings over passengers’ concerns about increased travel costs or being cut off should funding mean services were withdrawn.</body>

    <head>Cryptocurrency trading in UK should be regulated as form of gambling, say MPs</head>
    <body>UK authorities should regulate cryptocurrency trading as a form of gambling rather than a financial service, parliament’s Treasury committee has said after a fresh inquiry into the industry. The government must avoid wasting more taxpayer funds promoting tech innovations such as digital tokens, without demonstrating the clear benefits to the public, MPs said in a report published on Wednesday. Like gambling, cryptocurrency trading and investing can be addictive, MPs concluded. And while the underlying blockchain technology could benefit the wider financial services industry, the process of betting on the volatile price of unbacked assets such as bitcoin could lead consumers to lose life-changing sums of cash. “Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the UK’s financial services industry,” the Conservative MP and Treasury committee chair, Harriett Baldwin, said. “However, with no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such. “By betting on these unbacked ‘tokens’, consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.” The recommendations could influence government plans to regulate cryptocurrencies, which are being considered after a consultation earlier this year. It has been widely expected that cryptocurrency trading would eventually fall under the Financial Conduct Authority – which is currently responsible for ensuring firms comply with money-laundering rules, and will soon be tasked with monitoring adverts. However, the Treasury committee said treating cryptocurrency trading or investing like a financial service – and regulating it via the FCA – risked creating a “halo effect” that could lead consumers to believe the industry was “safer than it is” or that they were protected from financial losses, when they are not. The report said that regulating cryptocurrencies as gambling would be consistent with the government’s principle of “same risk, same regulatory outcome”. The report also hit out at the government’s recent attempt to produce a non-fungible token via the Royal Mint. NFTs are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain, the same decentralised ledger of transactions used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. However, the project – which Labour had criticised as a “crypto gimmick” – was scrapped in March, just under a year after the project being announced. The Treasury committee said it was calling on the government to take a “balanced approach” to technology and “avoid expending public resources on supporting cryptoasset activities without a clear, beneficial use case”, adding that the failed NFT project was “a case in point”. It said: “It is not the government’s role to promote particular technological innovations for their own sake.” The Treasury and the CryptoUK industry group were contacted for comment.</body>

    <head>Vaping boom and bust: from bans to starter kits, how the world is responding</head>
    <body>The vaping industry turns 20 this year, but Ira Simeonidis fears the golden age of e-cigarettes is already wafting away. “It’s a bit destroyed,” says the organiser of Hall of Vapes, Europe’s largest vaping trade fair, held in Stuttgart this month. His festival once drew more than 20,000 visitors, who attended talks, partied with DJs and browsed rows of exhibits by renowned designers showing off their latest “mods”, elaborately crafted devices for inhaling nicotine – and other substances of choice. “It was for professional and passionate vapers,” Simeonidis says. “A community thing, to get together, drink beer, vape and see each other once a year.” Related: My vaping addiction came out of nowhere – and I’m finding it impossible to quit | Imogen West-Knights E-cigarette products at a store in Melbourne. Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP But no more. While the festival was suspended for two years during the Covid-19 pandemic, the vaping world transformed. Markets around the world have been flooded with mass-produced disposable vapes, and a product that was once the province of speciality stores now fills the racks of corner shops, mobile-phone accessory stands and booths hawking tourist tat. The number of designers exhibiting at his fair more than halved this year, Simeonidis says. There were no concerts, and many of his stalls were taken up by companies selling disposable technology. “They’re cheaper and it’s catastrophic for the environment with their lithium batteries,” he laments. “Also, there are the kids.” ‘A game of whack-a-mole’ The rise of disposables has not only upset vaping purists. It is has intensified the focus of regulators around the world on what they fear is an explosion of vaping among young people, including school-age children, enticed by dark marketing of the products by social media influencers and kid-friendly flavours like crème brûlée, sour sherbet and Swedish fish. Data on the surge is still emerging, but a survey of British children found the proportion who vape more than doubled in the year to 2022, while the use of disposables soared by 600%. Both those trends were largely among children who were already smokers, though studies from Australia, New Zealand and the US suggest more significant numbers of teenagers who vape in those countries might have never touched traditional cigarettes. Interactive Another way to measure the explosive growth of disposables is the flood of candy-coloured cartridges that now scatter the surroundings of many universities and schools. “A guy who picks up litter told me he thought they were highlighters – and students were getting very studious in the parks,” says Freddie Dawson, a Dublin-based editor at Tamarind Intelligence, a firm that tracks the industry. “You just need to walk down the street and see what [vapes] young people are using – it’s always, always going to be disposables.” Even as debate continues over whether vapes are a life-saving tool to wean smokers off cigarettes, or an avenue for the nicotine industry to hook a new generation of addicts – and they may be both – concern over teenage use and the environmental toll of the devices is driving a new wave of regulation around the world. Australia has announced that it will impose the strongest restrictions of any developed market, completely banning recreational vaping while limiting the sale of the devices to pharmacies – and only with a doctor’s prescription. Other countries are unlikely to go that far, Dawson says, but many are tightening their own regimes, inching closer to treating vapes the way they do cigarettes. The Netherlands banned flavoured vapes this year, while France says it could prohibit disposable vapes by the end of 2023. In Ireland, children under 18 can legally buy vapes from any store – a loophole the Irish parliament is moving to close. A man vapes in front of the Tate Britain Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian New Zealand has implemented a world-first generational smoking ban, preventing anyone currently aged 14 and under from legally buying cigarettes for the rest of their lives. More Kiwi adults vape (8.3%) than smoke (8%) according to the latest data, but as elsewhere, that growth is particularly strong among young people. Vaping rates among 14- to 15-year-olds have tripled, and legislators are spooked. As some doctors and health groups call for a tougher stance, New Zealand’s government is re-examining its regulations. Associate health minister Ayesha Verrall, who has fronted many of the smoking changes, admitted in January that “youth vaping rates are too high” and the government “need[s] to strike a better balance”. The UK is holding an awkward pose, trying to curb what one expert has claimed is an “epidemic” of use by children, while at the same time offering vape starter kits to English smokers – in recognition that its own commissioned research says vaping is not danger-free, but “poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking” in the short and medium term. Estimates of the number of people who vape around the world vary wildly, from 40m to more than twice that many, with the majority thought to be in rich or upper-middle income countries where, even with the imposition of new duties, vaping is still cheaper than smoking heavily taxed cigarettes. A woman walks down the street vaping Photograph: Diego Fedele/AAP But as the price of vapes has fallen, the devices have proliferated in less wealthy countries such as South Africa, Malaysia and the dozens of others where regulations are nascent, and lawmakers are starting to voice similar worries over their use by adolescents. In China, where most of the world’s vapes are manufactured, flavours other than tobacco were banned in 2022, in recognition of their apparent danger to children – though exporting those same flavoured products to the rest of the world is still permitted, and booming. India was four years ahead of Australia in banning vapes outright, but its experience raises another question for lawmakers: how effectively can vapes be regulated? A survey published this year of young Indians found more than one in five had vaped at least once, despite the ban, with another fifth intending to try it in the next year. “The sale of e-cigarettes is rampant, and its sale by home deliveries and through the internet is extensive,” says Monika Arora, a vice-president of the Public Health Foundation of India. “Our work with school students is showing they’re experimenting from a very young age, class 8 [age 13-14] onwards.” Governments are likely to confront similar challenges as they seek to claw vapes back from the hands of young people. Ban specific flavours, for example, and manufacturers may tweak their recipes slightly to circumvent the rules. Prohibit vapes completely, and the black market is likely to live on – as it does for any drug. “It’s a game of whack-a-mole,” says Dawson. Enthusiasts may believe the golden age of e-cigarettes is over. But the vaping era, with all the fraught questions it coughs up, is only beginning. • This article was amended on 17 May 2023 to clarify that Australia’s tough measures against recreational vaping have been announced but are not yet law.

    <head>Renters’ reform must close loopholes for unfair evictions, campaigners say</head>
    <body>Tenants and campaigners have warned Michael Gove not to create a “back door” for unfair evictions as private rented sector reforms are unveiled on Wednesday. The legal overhaul will ban no-fault evictions but strengthen landlords’ rights to throw tenants out for antisocial behaviour. The secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities will announce the renters’ reform bill affecting 11 million private renters in England. “Too many renters are living in damp, unsafe, cold homes, powerless to put things right and with the threat of sudden eviction hanging over them,” he will say. But after lobbying from landlords, he will also “strengthen powers to evict antisocial tenants, broadening the disruptive and harmful activities that can lead to eviction and making it quicker to evict a tenant acting antisocially”, his department said. It could mean renters being given a two-week notice period for antisocial behaviour evictions and that any behaviour “capable” of “causing nuisance or annoyance” could trigger eviction. The bill will not, however, limit the frequency with which landlords can hike rents or rent caps. It is expected to outlaw extreme rent increases targeted at pushing tenants out. This will be policed by a new ombudsman for private rented housing and the courts. It comes four years after the government first promised to ban the 1988 no-fault eviction law, which has had a chilling effect on tenants’ confidence to challenge non-decent homes, of which there are estimated to be 1m in England. Since that promise was made by Theresa May and repeated in Boris Johnson’s December 2019 Conservative election manifesto, more than 54,000 households in the private rented sector in England have been threatened with a no-fault eviction and almost 17,000 households were evicted by bailiffs. Related: Average monthly rent outside London now more than £1,000, says agency Gove will say: “Our new laws introduced to parliament today will support the vast majority of responsible landlords who provide quality homes to their tenants, while delivering our manifesto commitment to abolish section 21 no-fault evictions. “This will ensure that everyone can live somewhere which is decent, safe and secure – a place they’re truly proud to call home.” Keir Starmer is expected to announce on Wednesday that a Labour government would reform the planning system and “bring back local housing targets”, describing his party as “builders not blockers”. Labour will become the party of housebuilders, he pledged in an interview with the Times, announcing plans to loosen restrictions on building in the green belt to help boost local housing supply. The bill looks set to be subject to fierce debate in parliament over definitions of antisocial behaviour and the policing and timing of new decency standards. Basic decent homes standards, which already apply to social housing, will be introduced, although there is no timetable yet for when landlords should fix issues such as damp, cold and pests. It comes as the private rented sector is in crisis. The number of households renting in England more than doubled between 2001 and 2021, the census showed, and demand for rentals after the pandemic is up 50% on the five-year average – and coincides with a fall in the stock of rental homes, pushing the price of new lets up more than 11% a year in March, according to Zoopla. Gove will also announce a new right for tenants to ask to live with a pet, which landlords “cannot unreasonably refuse”, and will make it illegal to refuse tenancies to people on benefits or with children. The London Renters Union said the bill was a “huge step forward for renters forced to live under the threat of ‘no-fault’ eviction” but it said “it will not bring us security in our homes”. “Landlords could circumnavigate the new eviction ban by using large rent hikes and other ‘back door’ evictions to force unwanted tenants out,” it said. The housing charity, Shelter, said the bill moved renters “one step closer to fairer, more secure housing”, but cautioned it must be “as strong as possible with every loophole closed so that no renter can be unfairly evicted”. Toby Lloyd, who was a Downing Street housing adviser when May first pledged the ban on section 21 no-fault evictions, said: “Widening landlords’ ability to gain possession over antisocial behaviour and non-payment of rent must not create another back door route to no fault evictions.” Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, warned that the plan outlined so far “lacks detail” and said that without assurance of repossession powers, “the bill will only exacerbate the rental housing supply crisis many tenants now face”. The lobby group also called for more staff in the court system to meet what is expected to be an increased workload if antisocial behaviour evictions take off.</body>

    <head>People too tired to lead healthier lifestyles, UK survey finds</head>
    <body>It’s the question many of us ask ourselves: why don’t I exercise more, eat better food and generally lead a healthier lifestyle? For many who want to, but just can’t seem to make it happen, it turns out the answer to that question is – feeling just too tired. A survey has found that tiredness is why 35% of people don’t make the changes to their diet and physical activity levels that would help them close the gap between good intentions and concrete action. The results, from a YouGov poll of 2,086 UK adults for the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), illustrate the barriers many people face in their desire to adopt and stick to healthy habits. When asked what was stopping them from eating more healthily and exercising more often, 29% of men and 40% of women cited “feeling too tired”. Even more put it down to “lack of motivation” (38%). Other common reasons given included the cost of food (30%), lack of time (26%) and work/life balance (25%). Others cited the cost of exercising (25%), such as buying a gym membership or equipment, lack of confidence (16%) and “not knowing where to start” (12%). Only one in four (24%) in the representative sample of the British population surveyed online said nothing prevented them from making healthy changes to their lifestyle. Matt Lambert, the charity’s health information and promotion manager, said: “People have busy schedules and we know that, for many, the last thing they might want to do when they are tired or lacking in motivation is to start cooking from scratch or going to the gym.” WCRF is launching an eight-week healthy living plan which it hopes will enable people to build healthier habits into their routine. It said eating well and taking exercise were important ways of reducing people’s risk of getting cancer and other diseases. One in two people will get cancer at some point in their lives. The charity, and Cancer Research UK, estimate that 40% of all cases of cancer could be avoided if more people lived healthier lives, for example by eating more healthily, being active, maintaining a normal weight, avoiding sunburn and not smoking. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was promoting healthier lifestyles to boost physical and mental health, for example through its “better health – every mind matters” campaign launched last week. It encourages people to use free apps, such as Couch to 5k and Active 10, to boost their activity levels.</body>

    <head>Outrage over flaw that may encourage Australia’s aged care homes to select residents based on profit margin</head>
    <body>The federal government must urgently address an unintended consequence of its aged care funding model which could lead to providers avoiding residents most in need of care, an advocacy group warns. The warning comes as the funding model’s lead designer accused some aged care providers and consultancy firms of trying to exploit the system for financial gain, and amid concern from the Greens of residents being treated as “commodities”. But the consultancy firm that exposed the potential flaw, Mirus Australia, said helping aged care providers understand how the funding system works is crucial to the sector’s financial viability, and stressed its advice would never “negatively affect the provision of care”. Related: ‘Get your money now’: consultants encourage aged care providers to exploit the system Last week, Guardian Australia reported Mirus had given providers a list of the most profitable older Australians based on the subsidies they generate and their care requirements, and advised providers to make strategic decisions “in a way that benefits the business”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Under the recently introduced Australian National Aged Care Classification funding model, subsidies paid to providers are determined by the care needs of each resident. Residents are independently placed into one of 13 categories depending on the level of care they require, and those who require more care generate larger subsidies. From October these subsidies will help providers deliver mandated care minutes for each resident. The minutes vary for each category of residents. Mirus has warned providers that reclassifying residents to reflect their deteriorating health may not always make business sense because increased subsidies won’t always cover the increased cost of mandated care. The company used the example of reclassifying a resident from class seven to nine, which would move them from assisted-mobility to a non-mobile category. This would increase the government subsidy by $10 a day and require an extra 11 minutes of care be provided. A registered nurse would need to provide seven of those minutes. “The cost to the business to meet that new level of care that we are mandated to [provide] means that ultimately we are moving backwards in our sustainability,” the company told providers in a video briefing. According to the analysis, a resident who is immobile and could be in respite care is the least profitable. “Funding of Australia’s aged care system is complex, confusing for many, and can lead to poor resident outcomes for those who don’t understand how it works,” a Mirus Australia spokesperson said. “Funding varies according to need.” The spokesperson added: “This helps explain why more than 1,000 aged care professionals recently attended our training courses, including representatives of the Independent Health and Aged Care Pricing Authority, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and the Department of Health.” ‘The government needs to take action’ Bryan Keon-Cohen, a retired barrister and founder of Aged Care Justice, a not-for-profit that assists families access legal representation, called on the federal government to investigate the Mirus modelling. “When a funding model creates disproportionate outcomes for aged care facilities by financially incentivising the admission of residents with less complex care needs than others, we are not putting the person first,” Keon-Cohen said. “Australia needs a sustainable person-centred model to ensure that the aged care sector is supported to deliver quality care to every resident, regardless of their subsidy classification. “Now that Mirus has identified the problem, the government needs to take action to ensure that the system works for all.” Prof Kathy Eagar, who helped design the government’s funding model and is a former adviser to the aged care royal commission, said the new system made it harder for providers to “manipulate the assessment system to maximise income”. The regulator must crack down on anyone who’s trying to game the system for financial gain Greens senator Janet Rice “But aged care is big business and consultants make a fortune attempting to manipulate the system,” said Eagar, who is now an adjunct professor at the Queensland University of Technology. “So called ‘cream skimming’ – selecting residents on the basis of who will be most profitable – has been big business in aged care for years.” ‘The elderly are not commodities’ The Greens senator Janet Rice was outraged by the categorisation of residents by profit margin and said she would raise the issue with government officials during Senate estimates. “This is disgusting, deplorable behaviour from industry consultants, lobbyists and aged care providers, and shows exactly what happens when government puts public services in the hands of private companies,” Rice said “People in aged care deserve care and support, not exploitation that maximises provider profits. The elderly are not commodities – they are people.” Related: Australian aged care providers warned against hiking fees for wealthy without proving it goes towards care Rice added: “The regulator must crack down on anyone who’s trying to game the system for financial gain.” Mirus Australia has not broken any rules and did not respond directly to Rice’s comments regarding issues around the funding model. A company spokesperson said ensuring providers operate efficiently allows more funding to be directed to care rather than administration costs. The federal government was contacted for comment.</body>

    <head>‘Anything can happen’: Inter’s Inzaghi urges belief in Champions League final</head>
    <body>Simone Inzaghi has admitted that Internazionale will be the underdogs in the Champions League final next month, but he insisted his team should not be written off against Manchester City or Real Madrid in Istanbul. Inter secured their first final place in 13 years with a 3-0 aggregate victory against their city rivals Milan on Tuesday night, but many observers – including the former Inter defender Christian Panucci – have described City v Real as “the real final”. Related: Lautaro Martínez finishes off Milan to put Inter in Champions League final “They are two huge clubs with immense quality,” Inzaghi conceded. “It’s a very open match. I believe that Inter and Milan did a great semi-final, two hard-fought intense games. Maybe against Real Madrid and Manchester City, Inter are the underdogs. “But anything can happen in football. We met Real Madrid last year, two losses unfortunately, but my team played very well. Manchester City need no introduction. I will watch tomorrow’s match, and we will see who wins.” Inter’s win – 1-0 on the night – capped a remarkable Champions League campaign for the Nerazzurri, who were rated as 50-1 outsiders to win the tournament after a daunting group-stage draw that pitted them against Bayern Munich and Barcelona. “It’s a dream come true, a dream that we’ve shared and grown together since the draw, because we had to believe, nobody gave us anything,” Inzaghi said. “Tomorrow we’ll realise what we’ve achieved, but this was a magic night with our fans and our families. We couldn’t ask for more.” The Milan coach Stefano Pioli defended his club’s youth-oriented recruitment strategy after a tie that exposed their lack of experience. “This is the club policy, and it’s giving us great results,” he said. “Inter in these two matches hurt us with counter-attacks and set pieces. These are situations we had to do better with. In these games you have to play to great levels, or you go out.”</body>

    <head>Rebekah Vardy: Jehovah’s Witnesses and Me review – this harrowing documentary will totally surprise you</head>
    <body>It may sound as if its title has come from the Alan Partridge school of TV commissioning, but there is nothing at all humorous about Rebekah Vardy: Jehovah’s Witnesses and Me. Vardy gets her notoriety out of the way in the early moments of this powerful film, explaining that she is best known as the wife of a Premier League footballer and “a bit of a controversial character from that trial”. What follows is a harrowing account of her early life as a Jehovah’s Witness and an investigation of the Christian denomination, its structures and its practices. Vardy has spoken before about being raised as a Jehovah’s Witness and her dislike of the organisation. Four years ago, she told the Loose Women panel that it was “horrible” and that, as a child, she felt alienated from other children, who would “poke fingers” at her for her beliefs. Here, she goes much further, describing a series of traumatic events, while meeting others who describe their experiences within what is portrayed as a “high control” religion. (As you would expect from a film so accusatory, there is a lot of back and forth, as the Jehovah’s Witnesses UK branch committee is given the right to reply to each allegation. In one response, they call the idea that the religion is controlling “misleading and discriminatory”.) Vardy points out that, in the UK, home to approximately 130,000 adult Jehovah’s Witnesses – there are roughly 8.5 million members worldwide – very little is known about the organisation and how it operates. She suggests that the perception from outsiders is of “harmless Christians that knock on your door, wanting to talk about God”. She offers her own view of what it was like growing up in Norwich, attending Kingdom Hall meetings and Bible studies twice a week, or standing on the street doing “service rounds”. She talks of the end of days and the books she read when she was very young, which showed her detailed pictures of what Armageddon would look like. She felt judged by the outside world and accepted only by other Jehovah’s Witnesses. From the age of 11, her life fell into disarray. Her parents divorced and she left Norwich, leading to former family members and friends “shunning” the family (divorce is allowed only under very limited circumstances). At 12, Vardy was sexually abused. By 15, she was “acting out” and was told to leave the family home. She has had very little contact with her family, many of whom are still Jehovah’s Witnesses, since. The Jehovah’s Witnesses deny that “shunning” takes place, but there are several accounts here from people who have left the church and say that even their closest family members no longer talk to them. One man admits that he shunned his own children and was instructed to hang up the phone if they called him. Related: Rebekah Vardy says she was sexually abused in Jehovah’s Witness childhood Vardy acknowledges that she feels a sense of guilt, even now, in going against the group and its teachings. But she is not alone. She expands her remit beyond the personal, speaking to others with stories to share. She meets a woman who had an affair while married, who alleges that the husband is treated as the head of the family and has absolute control over what happens within it. After explaining the system of “elders” – senior male members of the church who provide “spiritual guidance” – Vardy meets two former elders who now consider themselves to be “free”. These men describe how the system works and why they believe it meets the parameters of “high control”. She also meets a woman who was a Jehovah’s Witness for 50 years and courageously waives her right to anonymity to discuss being sexually abused as a child, as well as the horrific denials and labyrinthine procedures she faced when she tried to report it. As a presenter, Vardy is empathic and inquisitive. Clearly, she knows this world; when she meets others who have been through similar experiences, she has meaningful conversations perhaps because she has been there, too. When she tries to talk to the Jehovah’s Witnesses UK branch on camera, no one will come forward. That is not surprising, but this documentary certainly is. You may come to it cynically, thinking it an attempt at career rehabilitation after “that trial”, but I doubt you will get to the end and still think that way. • Rebekah Vardy: Jehovah’s Witnesses and Me is available on Channel 4</body>

    <head>Study finds weight gain early in life increases risk of prostate cancer death by 27%</head>
    <body>Men who put on 2st (12.7kg) before turning 30 are 27% more likely to die from prostate cancer in old age than those who maintain their teenage weight, early research suggests. A decades-long study into more than 250,000 Swedish men indicated there was a strong link between men gaining weight across their healthiest years and developing prostate cancer. The analysis, which was presented at the European Congress on Obesity, suggests those who gained at least half a kilogram a year (1.1lbs) from 17 to 60 had a 10% greater risk of aggressive prostate cancer and a 29% greater risk of fatal prostate cancer. But gaining weight more steeply puts you at a similar risk. A man putting on 13kg (28lbs) between the ages of 17 and 29 is associated with a 13% increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer and a 27% increased risk of fatal prostate cancer. The findings, which are yet to be peer reviewed, were part of the Obesity and Disease Development Sweden study from 1963-2014. Researchers analysed the data of Swedish men who had had their weight measured at least three times between the ages of 17 and 60. Dr Marisa da Silva, of the department of translational medicine at Lund University, said: “Knowing more about the factors that cause prostate cancer is key to preventing it. “We do not know if it is the weight gain itself or the long duration of being heavier that is the main driver of the association that we see. Nevertheless, one must gain weight to become heavier, so preventing a steep increase in weight in young men is imperative for the prevention of prostate cancer.” Of the 258,477 Swedish men who had taken part of the study, 23,348 participants were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with an average age at diagnosis of 70 years, with 4,790 men dying from the disease. Related: NHS in England to offer pioneering cancer drug to patients with ‘Jolie gene’ With more than 1.4m cases diagnosed every year, prostate cancer is the most common cancer occurring in men. In the UK, one in six men are diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime. Almost 12,000 men a year die from the disease in the UK, and African-Caribbean men in the UK are almost twice as likely to die from the disease compared with their white counterparts. Although many prostate cancers are slow-growing and may not cause a man harm during his lifetime, with eight in 10 men diagnosed in England living for at least 10 years after diagnosis, others can be more aggressive and harder to treat. Previous research has suggested a strong link between excess body fat increases and the risk of aggressive and fatal prostate cancer. Da Silva said: “Previous research has implicated elevated concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone that is involved in cell growth and development, with an increased risk of prostate cancer. “Levels of this hormone are raised in people with obesity and a steep increase in weight may fuel this elevation and the development of the cancer.” Simon Grieveson, assistant director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Several studies have indicated a possible correlation between being overweight and aggressive prostate cancer, and this study builds on those by suggesting that weight gain earlier in life is associated with an increased risk of dying from the disease. “While these results are intriguing, more research is needed to fully understand the biological link between obesity and prostate cancer – and, most importantly, how we can use this information to improve outcomes for men. Prostate Cancer UK is funding research to do just that. “Maintaining a healthy weight can protect against many cancers, but it is important to remember that prostate cancer can affect men of all weights, shapes, and sizes. Men over 50, Black men, and men with a family history are at highest risk of the disease and should speak to their doctor if they have concerns.”</body>

    <head>Biden reportedly cuts Asia trip short as debt ceiling talks enter crunch time – as it happened</head>
    <body>10.36pm BST Closing summary We’re only 16 days away from 1 June, when the US government – having hit the legal limit on how much money it can borrow months ago – is expected to exhaust its cash on hand and could default on its debt obligations, potentially causing a financial calamity. Today, Joe Biden met with top Republican and Democratic lawmakers in congress to negotiate a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Biden will be cutting his trip to Asia short, so he can continue negotiations. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy signaled that the talk was promising, even though Republicans and Democrats remain “far apart” on issues. Republicans want to cut federal spending before agreeing to lift the debt ceiling – scaling safety net back programs for poor Americans and seniors. They want to impose work requirements for recipients of public assistance, which could be a non-starter for many Democrats. A number of elections are happening today. Kentucky Republicans will vote on a challenger to take on the state’s Democratic governor Andy Beshear, and special elections in Pennsylvania could determine which party control’s the state’s house of representatives. In the Senate banking committee, Democratic and Republican lawmakers were skeptical of explanations from former Silicon Valley Bank CEO Gregory W Becker for why the institution went under. Updated at 10.41pm BST 9.42pm BST In a statement, the White House said the meeting today was “productive and direct”. “The president directed staff to continue to meet daily on outstanding issues. He said that he would like to check in with leaders later this week by phone, and meet with them upon his return from overseas,” according to the White House. The US could default on its debts by 1 June if negotiations do not conclude, and the debt ceiling is not raised, by then. Updated at 9.44pm BST 9.39pm BST Here’s the Guardian’s explainer on the debt ceiling, and the significance of these talks: Related: What is the US debt ceiling and what will happen if it is not raised? Updated at 9.40pm BST 9.20pm BST “It was a positive meeting,” said Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader. “We all agreed that default was not an option.” Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said that he and Jeffries were “committed” to getting a bipartisan bill done. “The bottom line is that we all came to agreement that we were going to continue discussions in the way that I believe Speaker McCarthy described, which was agreed to by all of us in the room together.” 9.10pm BST Lawmakers speak to press after debt limit meeting Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House speaker, said the two sides are still “far apart” on a debt limit deal. “It is possible to get a deal by the end of the week,” he said, and noted that the “structure of the talks” has improved. McCarthy said they’ve agreed to have Biden appoint someone to negotiate with Republican leaders. 9.01pm BST Back in Congress, CBS News tracked down George Santos to ask him what he thinks about the push by Democrats to expel him. Here’s what he has to say: ONLY ON @CBSNews: @RepSantosNY03 tells me what he thinks of a resolution introduced by @RepRobertGarcia to expel him from Congress. 👇🏾 pic.twitter.com/v7bUIQKDJY — Nikole Killion (@NikolenDC) May 16, 2023 The Guardian’s Maanvi Singh is taking the blog over to keep you updated on the rest of the news for today, including the outcome of the ongoing debt ceiling talks at the White House. 8.47pm BST Biden cuts Asia trip short to address debt limit – report Joe Biden has cut short his trip to Asia and will return on Sunday from visiting Japan to work on reaching a deal over the debt ceiling, NBC News reports: BREAKING BIDEN TRIP CHANGE According to a source familiar with the president&apos;s trip planning “President Biden has decided to return to the United States on Sunday, immediately following the completion of the G7, to ensure Congress takes action by the deadline to avert default.“ — Kelly O&apos;Donnell (@KellyO) May 16, 2023 The president had been set to stop in Australia, and pay the first visit by an American president to Papua New Guinea. According to the Washington Post, the three-country trip was meant to solidify allied efforts to counter China, as well as rally support for Ukraine and for fighting the climate crisis. Biden is still expected to meet with leaders from the G7 group of the world’s richest countries while in Hiroshima, Japan. Updated at 9.08pm BST 8.35pm BST A quick vibe check from Joe Biden at the start of the meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders in the Oval Office. “Hello folks. Get a good picture of all of us. We’re having a wonderful time. Everything’s going well,” he said to reporters, with a laugh that seemed to indicate everything is, perhaps, not going well. See the moment here. 8.25pm BST Biden, McCarthy convene at White House for debt ceiling talks Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy are now in the Oval Office for their latest attempt to find an agreement on raising the US government’s borrowing limit ahead of the estimated 1 June deadline for default. Joining them is vice-president Kamala Harris, the Senate’s Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber’s top Republican Mitch McConnell and the Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. The group said little to reporters who were allowed in briefly as the meeting began, but the lawmakers are expected to address the media at the White House once the gathering wraps up. The question now is whether they’ll have anything substantive to say. 8.09pm BST Robert Reich, a former secretary of labor professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and Guardian US columnist, has also weighed in on the standoff over raising the debt ceiling. He does not have much time for Republicans saying raising the debt ceiling would lead to higher spending and bigger federal debts. Writing on Twitter, he said: I’m sick and tired of hearing this lie peddled by the GOP and corporate media. Raising the debt ceiling does not increase spending or the federal debt. It simply allows the government to pay bills it has already taken on— and defaulting on the debt would be catastrophic. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) May 16, 2023 And spelling out what he thinks a GOP plan would mean, he wrote on Monday: The GOP’s debt ceiling plan would mean: -A reduction of up to 108K teachers and aides -200K children kicked off Head Start -Meals on Wheels taken away from 1 million seniors -7K fewer rail safety inspection days next year alone It&apos;s just ruthless — plain and simple. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) May 15, 2023 Updated at 8.22pm BST 8.06pm BST House speaker Kevin McCarthy is heading to the White House now to discuss the debt limit standoff with Joe Biden, alongside top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell and the chamber’s leader Chuck Schumer. Such talks have in the past not yielded a breakthrough, but there are signs that both parties are looking for a deal. Case in point: at the just-concluded White House press briefing, a reporter asked National Security Council spokesman John Kirby if Biden would continue with a trip to Asia scheduled to start on Wednesday, given the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations. Kirby indicated the president might cut his trip short: AP’s @ZekeJMiller: “Rest of [Biden&apos;s] trip is now up in the air because of debt limit negotiations?” National Security Council’s John Kirby: “What I can speak to is G7 and going to Hiroshima. The president’s looking forward to that. We’re taking a look at the rest of the trip.” pic.twitter.com/oOtIyRlZtI — The Recount (@therecount) May 16, 2023 Biden is scheduled to attend a meeting of G7 leaders in Japan, before visiting Australia and Papua New Guinea. Updated at 8.07pm BST 7.51pm BST House Democrat introduces resolution to expel George Santos House Democrat Robert Garcia has introduced a resolution to expel indicted fabulist George Santos from the chamber. Santos was elected as a Republican to represent the New York City suburbs last year, after which reports emerged that he lied about large parts of his resume. Last week, he was indicted on federal charges of fraud and money laundering, among other allegations. Garcia’s resolution requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass, which is a steep hill to climb, considering Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy has said he would call for Santos to resign only if the chamber’s ethics committee recommends it. The GOP has a slim majority in the House, and Santos supported McCarthy’s election as speaker, as well as many of his legislative priorities. Here’s the moment Garcia introduced the resolution on the House floor: Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) introduces a resolution to order “Rep. George Santos be, and hereby is, expelled from the House of Representatives.” pic.twitter.com/y5lwAihdtt — The Recount (@therecount) May 16, 2023 7.34pm BST Steve Phillips, the founder of Democracy in Color, has written for the Guardian about what he calls the Biden administration’s timidity when it comes to the debt ceiling fight with Republicans. He writes: One wonders what the Biden administration is afraid of when it comes to calling the Republicans’s bluff on raising the federal debt ceiling. While White House officials no doubt have genuine legal and policy concerns about their ability to act unilaterally to defuse the crisis, the overriding reason is probably fear of the political consequences, and on that front they are both misreading the moment and misunderstanding the composition of the country’s electorate.

What is it afraid of? | Stephen Phillips Updated at 8.22pm BST 6.56pm BST Away from US national politics, the state department has condemned the arrest of a former US consulate employee in Russia. Robert Shonov was detained in the Russian city of Vladivostok on suspicion of “cooperation on a confidential basis with a foreign state, international or foreign organization”. According to AP, the state department says Shonov is a Russian national who worked at the now-closed US consulate in Vladivostok for more than 25 years. He then worked at a company the US contracted with to support its embassy in Moscow. State department spokesman Matthew Miller told AP: “Mr Shonov’s only role at the time of his arrest was to compile media summaries of press items from publicly available Russian media sources .His being targeted under the ‘confidential cooperation’ statute highlights the Russian Federation’s blatant use of increasingly repressive laws against its own citizens.” Updated at 8.22pm BST 6.36pm BST A man who allegedly attacked two congressional workers with a metal baseball bat had a history of mental illness and had assaulted someone else earlier in the day, authorities said. The man, identified as Xuan-Kha Tran Pham, 49, of Fairfax, Virginia, attacked the Democratic congressman Gerry Connolly’s office on Monday, shattering windows and striking two women, including an intern on her first day on the job, authorities said. AP reports: Staffers then managed to shelter in an inner office until officers arrived, within five minutes. Connolly said they used a stun gun to subdue Pham. Pham, 49, has been violent before, attacking police officers last year. His father, Hy Pham, told the Washington Post his son was schizophrenic and had dealt with mental illness since his late teens. He said he had been trying, without success, to arrange mental health care for his son. Related: Alleged attacker of congressman’s staff had history of mental illness, police say Updated at 8.22pm BST 6.00pm BST As the debt ceiling hangs over Washington and the US economy as a whole, the Guardian’s Lauren Aratani has the answers to all your question about the high-stakes policy logjam: The US faces an “unprecedented economic and financial storm”, the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, warned on Tuesday as Joe Biden met with his Republican counterparts for the latest in a series of tense talks over the US debt ceiling. Time is quickly running out to find a solution, said Yellen. Without raising the debt limit, the US government will default on its bills, a historic first, with likely catastrophic consequences. Federal workers would be furloughed, global stock markets would crash and the US economy would probably drop into a recession.

I take responsibility for what ultimately happened,” Becker said in response to questions from Republican senator Katie Britt, who asked what he would have done differently. Britt asked him if he would return a $1.5m bonus he received before the institution went under, but Becker was vague. “I’m committed to cooperate with the process, with the regulators and other agencies that I know are going to be looking into that specific question,” he replied.

Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images “OK, well, I hope even if, for whatever reason, they say you don’t have to, I hope that you dig deep and you decide that that needs to be somewhere besides in your pocket,” Britt replied. Updated at 7.16pm BST 5.26pm BST Kevin McCarthy says he intends to push for more work requirements on public programs Ahead of his meeting with Joe Biden later today, Republican speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy has made clear that he intends to push for more work requirements on public assistance programs: House Speaker Kevin McCarthy calls for work requirements for “all the programs” as part of debt limit negotiations: “What work requirements actually do: help people get a job … The public wants it, both parties want it.” pic.twitter.com/lyUHBDu0si — The Recount (@therecount) May 16, 2023 Major anti-poverty programs the federal government runs include Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which states can use to offer cash and services to the poor. Republicans have long called for more requirements to ensure people receiving such aid are made to work or be looking for a job, but supporters of the programs say that would harm their effectiveness. Meanwhile in the Senate, the top Republican Mitch McConnell made clear that he’s letting McCarthy take the lead in negotiating with the White House: Ahead of the second debt ceiling meeting, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell signals he’s still backing the House GOP: “So, for the second time, I’ll be glad to sit in at the White House to support Speaker McCarthy and to urge President Biden to start operating in reality.” pic.twitter.com/a72rmq3kXD — The Recount (@therecount) May 16, 2023 Updated at 5.36pm BST 5.04pm BST While Republicans in statehouses under their control are moving to restrict abortion access, the party’s current presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has remained mum about how far he would go in curbing the procedure. He was asked repeatedly last week at a town hall hosted by CNN if he would sign a nationwide abortion ban, but refused to answer. He was similarly unclear in an interview published yesterday by the Messenger. That vagueness has provided an opening for Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who is expected to run for the Republican nomination while trying to close what polls indicate is a wide deficit in support between him and Trump. The former president has attacked DeSantis with a variety of colorful nicknames, and while the Florida governor has refrained from firing back to the same degree, he did criticize Trump over the abortion issue in a press conference today: Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) criticizes Donald Trump for refusing to commit to a federal abortion ban during his CNN town hall: “He didn’t give an answer about, ‘Would you have signed the heartbeat bill?’ … I was proud to do it. He won’t answer whether he would sign it or not.” pic.twitter.com/JPueGjEp8B — The Recount (@therecount) May 16, 2023 4.45pm BST In North Carolina, Republicans are today set to use their recently achieved supermajority in the state legislature to override the Democratic governor’s veto of a bill banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, the Associated Press reports. Democratic governor Roy Cooper vetoed the ban this weekend, which allows abortions at up to 24 weeks of pregnancy for “life threatening” anomalies and 20 weeks for cases of rape and incest, according to the AP. The GOP has a veto-proof majority in the Senate, and attained the same in the House after a Democrat who said she supported protecting abortion access switched parties. Republican leaders in both chambers believe they have the votes lined up to override Cooper’s veto, while the AP says the governor has singled out four Republican lawmakers who he said campaigned on protecting abortion access in an effort to get them to oppose the bill. Cooper discussed the ban in an interview with MSNBC: Gov. Roy Cooper (D-NC), ahead of GOP-controlled state legislature potentially overturning his veto of a 12-week abortion ban: “Right-wing politicians should not be in the exam room with women and their doctors ... We need to leave the medicine to doctors and decisions to women.” pic.twitter.com/C4FTDyUfp7 — The Recount (@therecount) May 16, 2023 4.25pm BST Ex-SVB chief criticised for not having a chief risk officer before collapse Back to the Senate banking committee, Democratic and Republican lawmakers were skeptical of explanations from former Silicon Valley Bank CEO Gregory W Becker for why the institution went under. “That sounds a lot like the dog ate my homework,” remarked the committee’s Democratic chair Sherrod Brown, after Becker in his opening statement blamed the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes as well as what he called a social media-fueled bank run for the collapse. Brown asked Becker to explain why Silicon Valley Bank did not have a chief risk officer on its staff for some of last year. That’s a position typically tasked with guarding against the type of insolvency that the bank eventually fell into. “We took risk management seriously,” Becker responded, and blamed the gap on the time it took to find a suitable candidate. The committee’s top Republican Tim Scott indicated he found Becker’s explanation wanting. “You said you took risk management seriously. It’s hard to believe that comment,” he said, pointing out that at the time of its collapse, 90% of Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits were uninsured by the federal government. Updated at 5.34pm BST 3.58pm BST Here are a few of the other elections happening across the United States today: Kentucky Republicans will vote on a challenger to take on the state’s Democratic governor Andy Beshear, who is standing for a second term in November. Control of Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives – and the fate of an abortion access referendum the GOP may put before voters – is at stake in two special elections that will determine which party controls the chamber, according to the Associated Press. Democrats need to win just one of these to cement their majority, and thwart Republicans’ efforts. Speaking of Pennsylvania, today is the day of the city’s Democratic primary for mayor – the victor of which is likely to win the general election in the solidly blue city. As with the Chicago mayor’s race earlier this year, the New York Times reports that the contest will serve as a bellwether of voters’ appetites for progressive leaders. Jacksonville, Florida is one of the few major cities in the United States with a Republican mayor, Lenny Curry. Term limits prevent him from running for another term, and polls are open in a runoff election today where voters will decide whether to replace him with another Republican, or hand the reins of the city to the Democratic candidate. 3.28pm BST There are a number of elections happening across the country today, including in Kentucky, where a Republican secretary of state who has taken pride in expanding voter turnout is facing a challenge from within his party, the Guardian’s Kira Lerner reports: Kentucky’s Republican secretary of state has earned widespread praise for increasing his state’s voter turnout during the coronavirus pandemic and for expanding opportunities to vote. He has also shot down conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and defended his state’s election system from claims of fraud, a stance that could cost him his job. On Tuesday, Michael Adams is facing a primary challenge from two Republicans who align themselves with the growing faction within the GOP who believe elections are frequently rigged and stolen. The winner will face Buddy Wheatley, a Democrat and former state representative, in November. In an interview, Adams said it would “absolutely” be worth it if he loses the race to have defended and expanded Kentucky’s elections, but he was hopeful that Kentucky Republicans understood the ways his reforms had benefited them.

The witnesses include the former Silicon Valley Bank CEO, Gregory W Becker, Scott A Shay, former chairman and co-founder of Signature Bank, and its former president, Eric R Howell. The two banks were shut down by federal authorities in the course of a weekend in March after suddenly becoming insolvent, raising fears of a crisis that could spread across the financial system. Another major regional bank, First Republic, failed the following month, and it’s unclear the extent of the risk posed to other financial institutions. Senators will probably ask about that at the hearing, which you can follow at the live stream embedded at the top of the page. Updated at 3.57pm BST 2.53pm BST The Congress gurus at Punchbowl News have a rundown of all the reasons to be worried about lawmakers’ ability to actually pass a debt limit compromise ahead of the 1 June deadline. Their concerns focus on the logistics of both reaching a compromise and getting a bill approved by Congress. Despite all the meetings, including the one scheduled for this afternoon between Joe Biden, Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders, the sides still appear to be far apart. Here, according to Punchbowl, are a few of the things that could still go wrong: Timing. House Republican leadership estimates congress needs 10 days to move this deal if and when it comes together.

Over the past few years, American families and businesses – including many of yours – have worked hard to mount a historic economic recovery. A default would reverse all of the hard-earned progress that we’ve made. And it would set us back even further,” she told a meeting of the Independent Community Bankers of America. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen. Photograph: Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters She described a scenario where the government would be unable to pay its bills, disrupting government services such as air traffic control and law enforcement as well as payments to military veterans and social security recipients. “And of course, the financial crisis that accompanies a default on our debt could multiply the severity of the downturn,” Yellen continued. “The US Treasury market serves as the very bedrock of the global financial system. There’s a reason for that: the world has never doubted that America will pay the principal and interest on its bonds – in full and on time. That’s a fundamental principle of modern finance. A default would crack open the foundations upon which our financial system is built. It is very conceivable that we’d see a number of financial markets break – with worldwide panic triggering margin calls, runs and fire sales.” Updated at 2.48pm BST 2.09pm BST Yellen confirms 1 June deadline for debt limit standoff In a letter to the Republican speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, released yesterday, the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, confirmed the first day of June remains the estimated date when the US government could default if the debt limit is not raised, dashing hopes that incoming tax revenue or other measures could push the deadline back further. “With additional information now available, I am writing to note that we still estimate that Treasury will likely no longer be able to satisfy all of the government’s obligations if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by early June, and potentially as early as June 1,” Yellen wrote, adding: “The actual date Treasury exhausts extraordinary measures could be a number of days or weeks later than these estimates.” She then warned McCarthy that even if a default is avoided at the last minute, the protracted uncertainty has already caused problems for the US economy: We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States. In fact, we have already seen Treasury’s borrowing costs increase substantially for securities maturing in early June. If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, it would cause severe hardship to American families, harm our global leadership position, and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests. I continue to urge Congress to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by acting as soon as possible. Updated at 2.13pm BST 1.46pm BST Biden and McCarthy to meet as debt ceiling talks enter crunch time Good mornings, US politics blog readers. Talks between Democrats and Republicans over raising the debt limit have gone the direction the pessimists told us they would. We’re only 16 days away from 1 June, when the US government – having hit the legal limit on how much money it can borrow months ago – is expected to exhaust its cash on hand and could default on its debt obligations, potentially causing a financial calamity. Joe Biden and top lawmakers in Congress have seen this day coming for months, and they’ve been negotiating for weeks, but there’s still no deal to raise the borrowing limit even though both parties say a default must be avoided. The good news here is that Biden, Kevin McCarthy and congressional leaders are meeting at 3pm ET, so perhaps a breakthrough is in the offing. Here’s what else is going on today: The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, is speaking this morning to a conference of the Independent Community Bankers of America in Washington DC, where she may elaborate on the administration’s view of the debt ceiling standoff. You may hear more about the report special counsel John Durham released on Monday examining the origins of the 2016 investigation into Donald Trump’s ties to Russia. Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the House foreign affairs committee, may hold the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in contempt over his refusal to turn over a 2021 dissent cable written by embassy staff in Kabul, Afghanistan.

Related: Lautaro Martínez finishes off Milan to put Inter in Champions League final Related: ‘Anything can happen’: Inter’s Inzaghi urges belief in Champions League final Updated at 12.01am BST 10.29pm BST Milan director Paolo Maldini has been talking into a microphone after tonight’s game. The season is not over, as we must try to qualify in the top four in Serie A and we’ll see what happens to Juventus,” Maldini told Sport Mediaset. “Reaching the semi-final was a great achievement and unexpected, but naturally if you lose against Inter then it will make this seem more painful than it otherwise would’ve been. We must remember this journey was totally unexpected. “In the last four games there really wasn’t much of a challenge. This game was better, but compromised by the bad performance in the first half. Perhaps the way Inter play causes us problems, but in recent weeks we have been struggling against teams that are frankly less prestigious and strong. “I would say eight [out of 10 for the season]. As we said last season, we are not yet built to handle two tournaments. We said that to the media, but also to the club owners, so they know that full well. This journey stated four years ago, which took great results, both economic and sporting, built a young foundation to the squad and there are roughly three years difference in the average age of our squad to Inter’s and that lack of experience tells at this level. “You are never satisfied at Milan, that is not allowed. I think there are opportunities to take, so reaching the Champions League semi-final is something we must make the most of economically too, so invest to finish in the top four and hope to repeat this journey again.” Maldini did have some good news over Leao’s contract. We are truly just down to the smallest details, it will certainly be done, that is for sure.” Updated at 10.31pm BST 10.19pm BST How many people even believed Inter would even make it to the knockouts after they were drawn with Bayern and Barcelona?

I’m not sure that’s true. I can imagine them nicking an early goal through a set piece and digging out a sneaky 1-0 win. It’s a big ask, unlikely but no impossible. Inter are very comfortable in a low block and have some clinical finishers in their side. 10.09pm BST Save for one moment in the first half where a low shot narrowly flew past the far post, Leao was a passenger tonight. In hindsight, I think it’s clear that he wasn’t 100% fit. But Pioli had to roll the dice, and we should give a lot of credit to Inter for their shape.

Inter’s fans are doing the ‘olés’. 9.51pm BST 89 min: “While I doubt that either Ancelotti or Guardiola will take a Champions League final for granted, Inter’s danger is widely underestimated”, emails Kári Tulinius. “They have such a varied array of attackers, that even if Inzaghi doesn’t get the frontline right from the get-go, he can radically change his team’s offence. And they’re unlikely to ship a bucketload of goals.” I will say that Inter are unorthodox, and have quality in the right areas. But I can’t see them beating Real or City. But that’s why we love football, there are lots of different ways to win. The same just isn’t true for so many other sports. 9.49pm BST 87 min: The game is petering out. Onana is picking his toenails in the Inter goal. Milan’s subs have offered no change to a turgid second-half display. 9.47pm BST 85 min: Milan fans, would you want to sign Brahim Diaz on a permanent deal? 9.46pm BST 83 min: “One more fact that shows how the Italian school of football is anything but dead,” emails Giovanni Cafagna. Three out of four managers in the CL semi finals are Italians (plus the manager of the European champions). It can be argued as much as you like that Italian teams have not been successful in CL for a long while but Italian football is not about the teams, it’s about the managers and the philosophy and tactical knowledge and the winning mentality they are able to impose on teams made of international players.” 9.45pm BST 80 min: Inter make further changes. Martinez is withdrawn to a thunderous clamour, with Correa coming on in his place. That’s clever again from Inzaghi, who can’t afford to lose the booked Martinez to a suspension in the final. Gagliardini also comes on for Barella, who was also cautioned. Updated at 9.49pm BST 9.44pm BST 78 min: Krunic, who has been chasing shadows all night, is booked for a poor challenge on Calhanoglu in midfield. Some handbags ensue, with (I think) Tomori and Martinez also receiving yellow cards. Saelemaekers comes on for Messias, and Origi – the eternal sub – replaces Diaz. Updated at 9.49pm BST 9.40pm BST 76 min: Martinez nearly makes it 2-0 on the night! He is again given too much space, this time on the edge of Milan’s box, and the Argentinian tries an audacious lob – a la Totti against Inter in 2005 – but Maignan is just tall enough to palm it behind. An inch or two away from being a spectacular goal. 9.36pm BST GOAL! Internazionale 1-0 Milan (Martinez 73, 3-0 agg) That’s the killer blow, surely! Martinez plays a one-two with Lukaku in Milan’s penalty box, gets goalside of Kalulu, and fires his shot low, hard and true past Maignan at his near post. Awful defending from Milan, who let Inter’s strikers take far too many touches, and also not the best goalkeeping. Maignan has kept Milan alive in this tie, but he’ll be disappointed with that. Inter’s fans, meanwhile … well you know the rest. Lautaro Martinez has surely sent Inter through to the final in Istanbul. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Lautaro Martinez scores for Inter! Photograph: Isabella Bonotto/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 9.44pm BST 9.32pm BST 72 min: An email from Tim Smith. “I have been waiting for Milan’s Messias to go scything through someone in midfield, picking up a yellow card, just so we can all say: “He’s not the Messiah, he’s a very naughty boy.” Has to happen.” 9.31pm BST 70 min: This is pretty uninspiring stuff. Diaz is too deep. Neither Messias or Leao are offering much out wide, and so Calabria and Hernandez are throwing hopeful balls towards Giroud, who is swamped by the three Inter centre backs. 9.27pm BST 67 min: Leao is having no joy on the left flank, so switches to the right. He stands up Acerbi, but the Portuguese’s cross is blocked, with the ball bouncing back off him for an Inter goal kick. The home fans cheer it like a goal. 9.25pm BST 65 min: Inter respond with a couple of changes of their own. Lukaku comes on for Dzeko, and Gosens replaces Dimarco. Good changes from Inzaghi, I think. 9.24pm BST 63 min: Thiaw comes off. The Milan man was on a yellow, so seems like a sensible decision. On comes Kalulu. 9.23pm BST 61 min: Thiaw looks like he’s pulled up with cramp, with Kjaer and Kalulu primed. But the German looks like he’s going to continue. A break in play, and Inter’s fans are celebrating in the stands like they have already won. Milan have offered very nothing in this second half. 9.20pm BST 59 min: I can’t imagine Pep Guardiola or Carlo Ancelotti watching this and quaking in their slippers. 9.18pm BST 57 min: The game is spluttering along. No fluency here, with plenty of fouls. Inter will be very happy, as things stand. 9.16pm BST 54 min: Our first booking of the second leg, and it’s been coming. Thiaw is booking for hauling Martinez down on the half-way line, after a neat turn from the Inter striker. Martinez is bullying the Milan back four, by the way. He’s winning every 50-50, chasing every ball. A menace. Lautaro Martinez is fouled by Malick Thiaw, who gets the first yellow card of the evening. Photograph: Emilio Andreoli/Inter/Getty Images Updated at 9.19pm BST 9.15pm BST 52 min: Play stops for an off-the-ball incident. Replays show Acerbi clearly stamping on the toes of Calabria as the players wait for a cross to come in. It’s deliberate, pre-meditated and a certain yellow card, but VAR fails to intervene! How utterly bizarre. Acerbi gets away with one. 9.12pm BST 51 min: Inter win a free-kick. Calhanoglu throwing himself to the turf after the faintest of shoves from Messias. It’s a bit embarrassing. 9.10pm BST 49 min: Brahim Diaz just can’t get a kick. 9.08pm BST 47 min: One of Milan’s many problems here is that they don’t have a strong bench to change things if we get to the hour mark without a goal. De Ketelaere has not impressed since his big move from Club Brugge, while Saelemaekers has flickered with talent, but not shown a consistent end product. Inter, meanwhile, have already brought Brozovic off the bench, and have Lukaku, Gosens and Correa to call on, among others. Brahim Diaz is challenged by Marcelo Brozovic. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP Updated at 9.12pm BST 9.05pm BST Peeeeeeeeeeep! And we’re off again for the second half. 9.04pm BST Meanwhile, Luton are 45 minutes away from reaching the Championship playoff final at Wembley. They have gone 2-0 up against Sunderland in the second leg to lead the tie 3-2.

Milan’s best idea seems to be hopeful balls towards Giroud, in the hope that they pick up the scraps. Hmmm. 8.47pm BST 45 min: Three minutes added on here. Both teams are going to ground far too easily, trying to con the referee. It doesn’t make for pleasant viewing. 8.46pm BST 43 min: Mkhitaryan is going to have to come off. The Inter man has picked up a knock and is replaced by Brozovic. Not a bad replacement to have. Some might even say an upgrade, although Mkhitaryan played very well in the first leg, getting that second goal. 8.45pm BST 42 min: Some nice detail from Ian Darke, BT Sport commentator. Dimarco was in the Inter crowd 20 years ago to watch the Champions League semi-final between these two. Related: ‘It was wonderful’: Shevchenko on Milan beating Inter in the 2003 semis 8.43pm BST 40 min: Inter come roaring back, and they are unlucky to not take the lead themselves. What a second leg this is! Calhanoglu whips a free-kick into the box with customary pace, and Dzeko wins the flick. Maignan sticks out a right hand and makes a point-blank save, with Thiaw booting the rebound away! What a blinding stop. 8.41pm BST 37 min: Chance for Leao! The Milan winger gets the better of Darmian, glides past Acerbi, but drags his left-footed shot wide, the ball just curling past the far post. The first real glimpse of Milan’s talisman. When he gets going, nobody can stop him. 8.38pm BST 35 min: Milan throw an inswinging cross into the box, that will happen with their inverted wingers, but Darmian and Acerbi marshall Giroud well, and get the danger away. 8.36pm BST 33 min: “I believe a large part of the reason Milan didn’t challenge for the title well this year is because Maignan was out injured for a large part of the season,” emails Justin Madson. “There’s other reasons, of course, but you cannot underestimate how important he is to this defence. Will be nice to see him get some international time as well - Lloris retiring has opened the door to showcase his talent. Waiting to see if he gets poached or, like Leao, commits to Milan.” Completely agree. If he’s not already the best in the world (Courtois and Ter Stegen might have something to say), he’s definitely in the conversation. Magic Mike Maignan. Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 8.39pm BST 8.34pm BST 30 min: Hernandez catches Dumfries with a high boot as their feud re-ignites. Free-kick to Inter, but Hernandez was unlucky in truth, as Dumfries dived low with his head to win the ball. The home fans are calling for a booking, but the French referee is unmoved. 8.32pm BST 28 min: Never before have a seen a slower side try and play on the counter-attack. Inter are making it work, though. 8.30pm BST 26 min: “A Milan matchup wouldn’t be complete without comments on the fashion on show,” emails Peter Oh. “Inter’s classic sponsorless shirts give the Nerazzurri a clear edge. As for the managers’ threads, both gaffers have opted for sharp black suits but Inzaghi’s choice of button-sized badges on his sleeves is questionable. Advantage Pioli.” The suit is a bit Libertines. Inzaghi is Carl Barat if he never found the gear. 8.26pm BST 24 min: Tonali brings Martinez to the deck on a dangerous Inter counter-attack. A minute later, a nasty challenge on Dimarco, from Calabria. Things are getting tasty. 8.25pm BST 22 min: Giroud is clutching his leg, worryingly. Seems like he stretched a bit too far in trying to close down Bastoni. Looks like he’s going to be OK to continue. 8.24pm BST 19 min: Milan need an early goal, or a first-half one at least. Inter’s experience will see this game out easily enough if there’s a two-goal cushion. Rafael Leao is challenged by Nicolo Barella. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP Updated at 8.26pm BST 8.22pm BST 16 min: Diaz is very talented, capable of brilliant moments (see his performance against Napoli a month ago) but the Spaniard is currently being roughed up by Inter’s midfield, just as he was in the first leg. Needs to move the ball quicker, because at 5ft6in, he’s not going to win the physical battle. 8.19pm BST 14 min: Inter respond, with Dzeko sprinting in behind (!). The ball arrives at Barella, who rasps a fierce shot goalwards, but Maignan is equal to it. One of the world’s best stoppers, IMO. 8.16pm BST 12 min: Golden chance for Milan! Squandered by Diaz! Crikey, it should be 1-0, 2-1 on aggregate. Tonali bursts past Mkhitaryan and gets to the byline, cuts the ball back. There are three Milan players waiting, but Diaz takes a first-time shot from the penalty spot with his weaker right foot, and the ball dribbles gently into the arms of Onana, who did well to read the intentions of Milan’s No 10. Diaz should have buried it. Giroud has his head in his hands. 8.14pm BST 10 min: Milan, though, have settled. Diaz and Messias make some probing runs and a cross towards Giroud has Onana flapping at the back post. Only a header behind from Darmian stops Tonali from heading into an empty net! 8.09pm BST 7min: A good start to this game. Inter have made the better of it. First Dumfries picks the pocket of Leão, then Barella finds some space on the edge of Inter’s box but his shot is high and wide. 8.07pm BST 5 min: Oh my. Hernandez has nearly ripped one in the top corner from about 40 yards out. The Milan left back lets fly, and the ball swerves wildly to Onana’s right before just disappearing over the bar. The Inter keeper was nowhere there. Theo Hernandez lets fly from a long way out. Close! Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP Updated at 8.15pm BST 8.05pm BST 3 min: Barella beats Tonali to a ball at the back post, nods back towards Dzeko, who wallops a volley straight at Maignan. A warning shot, even if Barella was actually (harshly) penalised for that aerial duel with Tonali. 8.03pm BST 2 min: Dumfries and Hernández had a decent tussle in the first leg, and the collide – sort of – down Inter’s right flank, with the Milan man hitting the deck as he chases a ball back to his own byline. A free-kick is awarded. Soft. 8.00pm BST We&apos;re off! Peeeeeeeeeeeeep! 8.00pm BST “Do you think Dumfries is known as Queen of the South to his mates?” emails Richard Hirst. Catchy. 7.58pm BST Here come the players, for real this time. I’m am absolutely buzzing for this one. THE CHAMPIONNNNNNS!!!!!!! 7.54pm BST There’s another footy match going on tonight. Is it as important as this one? I couldn’t possibly comment. Related: Luton v Sunderland: Championship playoff semi-final, second leg – live 7.35pm BST In Inter’s 3-5-2 system, the most important players are their wing backs, Dumfries and Di Marco. Too far forward, and the three centre backs can become easily exposed. Too far back, and Martinez and Dzeko will become too exposed. Neither forward is blessed with pace, but can be deadly when crosses come into the box. Dumfries and Di Marco will help supply the ammunition to put this tie to bed. 7.23pm BST An email! “The last two World Cups have been the poorer for the absence of Italy,” writes Justin Kavanagh. “Say what you want about the dark arts, their defensive tendencies (though Euro 2020 surely dispelled that to the hysteria books once and for all), and the pasta doubts of Alex Ferguson, but this year’s CL Final will have a richer narrative because of the men from Milan. Every panto needs a villain.” Italian football is a fickle thing. Much maligned, much romanticised. But these are the facts. The national team are European champions, and all three European competitions (Champions League, Europa League, Europa Conference League) could all yet be won by an Italian side. I’ve got a funny feeling about Milan tonight. They are down but not out. 7.17pm BST It’s 20 years since Milan and Inter last went toe-to-toe in the semi-finals of the Champions League. In this piece by Emmet Gates, Andriy Shevchenko remembers the goal that set Milan on their way to the final (and eventual glory at Old Trafford). Related: ‘It was wonderful’: Shevchenko on Milan beating Inter in the 2003 semis 7.14pm BST The players are out for their warm-up. The atmosphere is so deafening, I can’t hear what BT Sport’s James Horncastle is saying. 7.06pm BST The teams Inter (3-5-2): Onana, Darmian, Acerbi, Bastoni, Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco, Martinez, Dzeko. Subs: Handanovic, Gagliardini, De Vrij, Gosens, Correa, Bellanova, Asllani, Cordaz, D’Ambrosio, Stankovic, Brozovic, Lukaku. Milan (4-2-3-1): Maignan, Calabria, Thiaw, Tomori, Hernandez, Krunic, Tonali, Messias, Diaz, Leao, Giroud. Subs: Ballo-Toure, Rebic, Kalulu Kyatengwa, Kjaer, Florenzi, Origi, Pobega, Gabbia, Saelemaekers, Mirante, De Ketelaere, Nava. Referee: Clement Turpin (France) Updated at 7.12pm BST 7.04pm BST One Milan player that will not feature this evening is Ismaël Bennacer, who went off injured in the first leg. The Algerian has been at the heart of everything Milan have done well this season, particularly after his move up the pitch into the No 10 role. The club released a statement on his injury progress earlier today. AC Milan announces that Ismaël Bennacer underwent surgery on his right knee in Lyon this morning. The repair of the cartilage lesion was successfully performed by Dr. Bertrand Sonnery Cottet in the presence of AC Milan’s club doctor, Dr. Stefano Mazzoni. The recovery time is estimated to be at least six months. On his Instagram, Bennacer posted: Hello everyone! My knee surgery went very well. The road to recovery starts today, It will be long, difficult, and will keep me away from the field for several months. But I am ready to overcome this ordeal with courage and determination. I will work hard, fight every day, to come back stronger and be again able to defend the colours of my club and my country. Thank you all for your messages and the strength you are giving me to get through all of this. I will keep you updated on each step of my recovery. 6.59pm BST Inter are overwhelming favourites to reach the finals after their 2-0 win in the first leg. Milan were toothless without the injured Rafael Leão, their star player who watched on from the sidelines. But the Portuguese is back tonight, and any chance of a comeback for the ‘away’ side tonight rests squarely on his shoulders. Leão led Milan to the Scudetto last season. This campaign, he has missed three games, two due to suspension and one due to injury: Milan have lost all three. Leão’s assist to set up Olivier Giroud in the quarter-final against Napoli was one of the finest this season. Rafael Leão&apos;s coast to coast run and assist 🥵@acmilan || #UCL pic.twitter.com/Uvrkf63B2U — UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) April 21, 2023 Not only is he a matchwinner in his own right, but his ability to draw defenders opens up more space for Milan’s other attacking threats: Giroud and Brahim Díaz in particular. Leão’s importance cannot be overstated. 6.30pm BST Preamble This is no ordinary football match. Normally, a Champions League semi-final would demand enough attention. For Internazionale and Milan, this is not just about reaching the final. Whoever is victorious will celebrate the other’s demise as much as their own triumph. This is not just about tonight. This is about history. This is (also) about the future. The history. Milan is the only city in Europe to have two Champions League winners within their walls, with Internazionale and Milan sharing 10 European Cups between them. Ten! But 13 years have passed since either scaled the mountain. The Stadio Giuseppe Meazza is a unique stadium steeped in legacy, hosting four European Cup finals. Last week it pulsed with ferocity, and one wondered why anyone ever came up with idea of tearing the San Siro down. This week, it’s Inter’s turn to be the ‘home’ side, and they bring a 2-0 lead into the second leg, courtesy of goals from Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. The scene at San Siro before the start of the first leg. Photograph: AC Milan/Getty Images The future. For Milan, this game has another facet. Their surprise 2-0 defeat to Spezia at the weekend means they now sit four points afrift of fourth-placed Lazio with three games remaining, meaning they are unlikely to qualify for the Champions League next season. Apart from the obvious glory of adding an eighth title, winning the competition would also ensure they qualify for 2023-24, providing a vital boost to the depleted coffers. So, quite a lot to get excited about, then. This is no ordinary football match. Kick-off: 8pm BST, 9pm in Milan. Updated at 6.33pm BST</body>

    <head>Chinese embassy calls Liz Truss’s trip to Taiwan a ‘dangerous political stunt’</head>
    <body>Liz Truss’s trip to Taiwan this week is a “dangerous political stunt”, the Chinese embassy in London has said, as the former prime minister prepares to call on Rishi Sunak to declare Beijing a “threat” to UK security. She is expected to use a speech in Taipei City on Wednesday to challenge the prime minister to deliver on his rhetoric during last summer’s Conservative party leadership contest, when he declared China “the biggest-long term threat to Britain”. He also promised to close all 30 of the UK’s Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese culture on campus in higher education and in some British schools. In a pre-briefed extract of her speech to the Prospect Foundation, Truss is expected to say: “Last summer the now British prime minister described China as ‘the biggest long-term threat to Britain’, and said the Confucius Institutes should be closed. He was right and we need to see those policies enacted urgently. “The UK’s integrated review needs to be amended to state clearly that China is a threat. Confucius Institutes should be closed down immediately. Instead, the service could be provided by organisations with the support of Hong Kong nationals and Taiwanese nationals who have come to the UK, on a free basis.” A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said Truss’s visit to Taiwan was a “dangerous political show which will do nothing but harm to the UK”. The statement on the embassy website added: “We urge the relevant British politician to correct her wrongdoing, stop making political shows with the Taiwan question and stop conniving at and supporting ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist forces.” Truss is the most senior British politician to visit the country since Margaret Thatcher in the 1990s, and comes at a time when relations between Britain and China have been at their most fractious in decades. The former Conservative leader is also expected to urge the west not to work with China, warning that totalitarian regimes “don’t tell the truth”. “There are still too many in the west who are trying to cling on to the idea that we can cooperate with China on issues like climate change, as if there is nothing wrong; that there are bigger issues than Chinese global dominance or the future of freedom and democracy,” she is expected to say. “But without freedom and democracy there is nothing else.” Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with the Communist party in control of the mainland. The island has never been part of the People’s Republic of China but Beijing has insisted it must unite with the mainland, by force if necessary. A UK government spokesperson said it was in Britain’s interests to “continue engagement” with China while recognising the challenges the country presents, adding: “We have always been clear that China remains the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security. “That’s why our integrated review refresh sets out a new approach to dealing with the challenge which China presents for the UK and the wider world.”</body>

    <head>Luton 2-0 Sunderland (agg: 3-2): Championship playoff semi-final, second leg – as it happened</head>
    <body>10.10pm BST Which means we’re done here. Thanks for your company; peace out. 10.10pm BST Here’s Nick Ames’ match report: Related: Luton reach playoff final as captain Tom Lockyer sees off Sunderland 10.06pm BST Related: Internazionale in Champions League final after Martínez sinks Milan 10.06pm BST Morris says he’s learnt a lot how much stuff like this means to the club, saying he spoke to someone who’s been watching Luton for more than 60 years, so hopes he enjoyed tonight. He doesn’t think his team turned up at the weekend, and is glad they had a chance to put it right tonight. He loves coming to work every day, loves Lockyer, and can’t wait to get involved with the celebrations. Lockyer, meanwhile, says he thought he’d throw his head at the corner from which he scored and see what happened. He doesn’t think any fans will care that Edwards came from Watford, he allows his players to express themselves and though they were dead on their feet at the end, they hung on. He’s the official player of the match, and earned it ion the grand style, not just for his goal but for his leadership and intensity. 10.02pm BST And hold tight Rob Edwards, sacked by Watford, Luton’s rivals, and now going to Wembley. He’s done an incredible job and wasn’t too precious to impose a physical style he knew Sunderland couldn’t handle. 10.01pm BST Lockyer, player of the match and then some, says they had to “mix it up” and &quot;be dirty” to beat Sunderland, before the camera cuts out. 10.00pm BST It’s all over at San Siro too, Inter winning 1-0 to complete a 3-0 aggregate win. They meet Man City or Real Madrid in the Champions League final. Related: Internazionale 1-0 Milan (agg: 3-0): Champions League semi-final second leg – live 9.59pm BST In the stands, David Pleat and Mick Harford enjoy the moment; this is an incredible achievement by Luton, it really is. 9.58pm BST Fans invade the pitch to dance with the players; it’s extremely wholesome. But a word for Sunderland, who’ve had a terrific season; tonight was a game too far, but good things are happening on Wearside, and it’s about time. They’ll be dancing in the streets of Bedfordshire tonight. Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images Updated at 10.10pm BST 9.57pm BST Full time: Luton Town (3) 2-0 (2) Sunderland Less than a decade ago, Luton were in the Conference; in fewer than three weeks, they might be a Premier League club! Patrick Roberts is crestfallen at full-time. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/Reuters Updated at 10.00pm BST 9.56pm BST 90+5 min Roberts mooches down the right, this is Sunderland’s last chance … and he pumps a cross right into Horvath’s arms. That is surely it?! Updated at 9.56pm BST 9.55pm BST 90+4 min Mpanzu is booked for something or other. 9.55pm BST 90+3 min But Osho heads away, Lockyer charges over to the line and slams it downfield almost from in the stand, and Drameh races away leading a four on one! all he needs to do is draw Johnson and tee-up whoever he fancies for a tap-in, but instead he shoots himself and a tame effort dribbles past the near post! That was the match right there! 9.53pm BST 90+3 min But ball down the line sees Huggins charging after it, sliding into a cross that Osho blocks behind for a corner. Up comes Patterson… 9.53pm BST 90+2 min Lockyer, who’s been an absolute giant, hauls his team up the park – he knows if they keep doing what they’ve been doing, they’re going to Wembley. 9.52pm BST 90+1 min Now Luton sit back and Roberts finds Clarke, who jinks inside, freeing up Alese on his outside … only to ignore him and look inside where he’s crowded out. 9.51pm BST 90 min Mchut finds Roberts 25 yards out, he dips inside Nakamba and lamps miles over the top. It’s been that kind of night for Sunderland, who have four minutes to save themselves. 9.49pm BST 88 min Ach, Clarke finds Diallo 30 yards from goal, but a heavy touch means he’s quickly unloaded. Sunderland have been so poor tonight, but their fans are still giving it plenty, performing footballing defiance in the traditional manner. 9.47pm BST 86 min Sunderland have had 605 of the ball – it doesn’t feel like that – and 37 v 11 touches in the opposing box, in favour of Luton, better explains what we’ve seen and why the score is as it is. Updated at 9.48pm BST 9.46pm BST 85 min This is sobering, and given the money sloshing about the game, totally unnecessary. The latest winding up petition by HMRC against Southend United will be heard tomorrow, at some point after 11:30am — Thomas Feaheny (@ThomasFeaheny) May 16, 2023 9.45pm BST 84 min A nice touch from Morris, flicking his foot to send the ball behind him for Mpanzu to run onto, but O’Nien is there to see away. 9.43pm BST 83 min Luton are seeing this out pretty comfortably – so far – and bring on Campbell for Clark. Jordan Clark takes a corner for Luton. Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/JMP/Shutterstock Updated at 9.46pm BST 9.43pm BST 81 min “Can the pitch size make that much of a difference?” wonders Joe Pearson. “I have the Milan Derby on another screen, and San Siro is 114 X 74. Kenilworth Road is 110 X 72. Frankly, that’s not that much different. The respective camera angles sure make it look smaller, but effectively that doesn’t really seem that material. But what do I know, I’ve never kicked a ball.” I think it’s enough to make a difference, because Lurton’s wide centre-backs can stay narrow knowing they can get out if they have to, and the wing-backs are able to drop in if necessary . If they’re even a couple of metres further away, it’s much harder to do. 9.40pm BST 79 min “Can we please talk about club colours,” beseeches Julian Menz. “Luton’s ‘orange’ has become so red that it would take an out-of-work TV interior designer (Lawrence?) to spot the difference. Not to mention Wolves, whose ‘old gold’ seems to have become Watford yellow. Nitpicking I know, but still….” I don’t think Wolves have played in old gold for decades, but Luton, once upon a time, played in white – and I agree, this is not very orange. 9.39pm BST 78 min Two more changes for Sunderland: Huggins and Ba on, Gooch and Neil off. 9.38pm BST 76 min Luton have been so physically dominant they’ve not sat back to protect their lead as I thought they might. If they keep doing what they’re doing, it’s hard to see them losing their lead. 9.36pm BST 75 min But they win a free-kick down the left, Neil to swerve in … except he scuffs into the wall then, as Sunderland try to sustain the attack, Amad beats his man only to slip immediately afterwards. 9.35pm BST 74 min Bit of Sunderland possession, but they can’t pick a pass through Luton who are, as we thought, blocking up the middle of the pitch. They’ve run out of ideas, and with 15 to go are already in Hail Mary territory. Marvelous Nakamba keeps possession for Luton.

Inter will play in the Champions League final, against either Man City or Real Madrid. Related: Internazionale v Milan: Champions League semi-final second leg – live 9.33pm BST 71 min I hate to say it, but Sunderland might need to take a leaf out of Luton’s book, because doing it their way isn’t getting them close to close. It’s too late now, but it might’ve made sense to keep Gelhardt on, get Michut up with him, and get the ball forward quickly. 9.31pm BST 69 min Sunderland just can’t get any momentum, Luton pinning, crowding and hustling. And when Roberts sashays down the right, Osho upends him fairly, thrashing clear. 9.30pm BST 68 min I’m not sure Luton will be as effective if they make it to Wembley – Boro could easily pass around them if they see off Coventry and play properly – but I could see them winning enough home points to stay up if things went very very well . 9.27pm BST 66 min Luton are just too physical for Sunderland, especially on a tight pitch. Mpanzu bustles through a couple of challenges then wins a free-kick 40 yards out, so the big lads got forward. This time, though, O’Nien makes definitive contact and heads into touch. 9.25pm BST 64 min Sunderland try something different, Michut replacing Gelhardt – whose enticing ruckus with Lockyer never quite materialised. 9.24pm BST 63 min Now it’s Rpoberts in attack, skirting across Clark before Osho makes the challenge. 9.23pm BST 62 min Again, the delivery is excellent – Clark is a bad man – and Adebayo meets it well, but again Roberts does superbly to head away, this time from on the line! I keep saying it, but I can’t see how Sunderland score and don’t concede. 9.22pm BST 61 min Again, the delivery is excellent, and Roberts does superbly to head behind from under the bar. 9.22pm BST 60 min Mpanzu into Morris, who slides in Adebayo at inside-right and is he in?! No! Alese charges alongside and does just enough to make the tackle without conceding a penalty, but Luton do have a corner. 9.20pm BST 59 min Amad draws in Nakamba and spins him, only to pass directly to Doughty. Sunderland really need to find a way of getting him on the ball more often. 9.18pm BST 57 min Change for Sunderland, Pritchard – who’s carrying a knock from the first leg – replaced by Alese. Hell go to left-back with Gooch moving to right and Roberts into midfield. 9.17pm BST 56 min Sunderland again clear the corner only to concede another, and this time Mpanzu pins the keeper before Adebayo heads over the top. I get the feeling that Sunderland might need two to get penalties, because Luton look good for another set-piece goal. 9.15pm BST 54 min The away end are getting behind their team now, and Sunderland are starting to dominate possession. And provided Luton don’t score again, that may continue, as the home side opt to hold what they have … but in the meantime, they win a corner swarming Sunderland as they play out with Drameh making the key intervention. 9.14pm BST 53 min O’Nien carries forward but Clarke’s pass to Gooch, nashing on his outside, is needlessly heavy, so the eventuating cross is on the stretch and from the line, so easily cleared. 9.13pm BST 51 min Sunderland are already looking more likely, and let’s not forget that just last week, they devastated Preston 3-0 after going in goalless at half-time. Luton, though, will not offer them similar space, and they’ve still to create an open-play opportunity. Amad Diallo lays the ball off to a teammate. Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport/Getty Images Updated at 9.28pm BST 9.11pm BST 50 min “I like to think that Eric Morecambe is currently watching and being very happy at the moment,” tweets Chris Rowe. That’s a more comforting thought than considering some of Luton’s 80s types. 9.10pm BST 49 min Now Luton surge forward, Drameh crossing and Adebayo volleying into his own leg and into the ground. This has got some tempo about it, and I doubt it’s getting any less frantic. Updated at 9.10pm BST 9.09pm BST 48 min Sunderland win a corner and take it short along the by-line to Amad, who sways inside then wiggles outside Doughty, his cross deflected behind. So in comes another cross and it’s Big Amad up, heading wide of the near post. 9.08pm BST 46 min Goodness me! O’Nien totally misses his kick, Sunday League hungover-style, but Patterson is there ahead of Morris … only to kick straight at Clark … who shanks his shot wide of the near post! Absolutely dreadful behaviour all round. 9.06pm BST 46 min We go again. Sunderland must score, and there are no away goals. 8.56pm BST Half-time viewing: 8.52pm BST At San Siro it’s 0-0 on the night, 2-0 Inter on aggregate. Related: Internazionale v Milan: Champions League semi-final second leg – live 8.51pm BST Half-time: Luton Town (3) 2-0 (2) Sunderland A frantic, intense half, with the score reflecting the balance of play. 8.50pm BST 45+2 min Here’s Clarke down the left, he crosses, and from the edge, Amad miskicks a volley into the ground. 8.49pm BST 45+1 min I wonder if Sunderland will think about going into Gelhardt early, getting men around him, and going form there. They’re struggling to find the spaces, so perhaps they just need to get their better players on the ball and take it from there. 8.48pm BST 45 min We’ll have two additional minutes. 8.47pm BST 44 min I think it’s 31 games since Sunderland failed to score, so we can expect them to tonight; problem is, they just don’t look able to stop Luton winning set-pieces, never mind defend them. 8.46pm BST GOAL! Luton (3) 2-0 (2) Sunderland Sunderland get the first ball away, but only to the edge, and it quickly goes back to Doughty who, now with an angle, bends in a glorious flat, quick ball which Lockyer meets on the run, punishing a header beyond Patterson! My god he wanted that, and Luton are flying! Tom Lockyer scores for Luton! Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images Updated at 8.49pm BST 8.45pm BST 42 min Drameh, who’s been quiet, advances down the right, crosses, and O’Nien blocks behind. Another corner, Adebayo and Morris stood on Patterson… 8.44pm BST 40 min Morris overruns the ball and, as Neil slides in, tramples on his ankle and calf. Somehow, the ref appraises not even a yellow card and a free-kick to Luton – Neil is less than gruntled – meaning another chance for them to stick a ball into the box … but Roberts is there to head clear. That could easily have been a red, and not even of the seenemgiven variety. Updated at 9.00pm BST 8.42pm BST 38 min Clark feed a ball in behind for Adebayo, who cant make anything of it. Nonetheless, Luton look the more likely again, their rampaging style allowing them to get the ball into dangerous areas more often than Sunderland. I wonder if Mowbray will change something at half-time, because his side are struggling to create currently. 8.40pm BST 37 min Morris lays off nicely for Adebayo, but out of nowhere, Roberts slides in to make a fine recovery challenge just inside the box. That had to be perfect and it was. Elijah Adebayo is challenged by Trai Hume. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Updated at 8.46pm BST 8.39pm BST 35 min There’s almost something nostalgic about watching Luton – in a way they’re not unlike 80s Wimbledon, turning games into physical contests. I’d be interested to see how that worked in the Prem, because most defenders aren’t used to facing two strikers, never mind two like Morris and Adebayo. 8.35pm BST 31 min In comes another decent corner and Morris is up, glancing a header towards the far post … and it looks like Patterson sees it late! But have a look! He plunges to his right and prangs it away with a strong arm, then when Adebahyo recovers possession, Lockyer heads just past the for post! These set-pieces are causing Sunderland all sorts, and there’s not loads they can do to stop them from happening. 8.33pm BST 30 min Abebayo draws O’Nien out wide and after a scrap for the ball, forces by on the outside. So O’Nien hauls him back and is booked, while Luton have a free-kick down the right, not far outside the box… 8.32pm BST 29 min Sunderland haven’t really created anything yet, and ultimately, it’s easier for Luton to put them under by lamping it forward, than it for them to do the reverse, as it requires more successful passes. 8.30pm BST 27 min Doughty progresses down the left and flicks square to Ruddock, who lines up a shot only for Hume to hurl himself at the block. The alacrity with which players do that will never cease to amaze me. 8.29pm BST 26 min Amad taxes possession off Bell and bursts off then leathers a shot that Lockyer blocks at source. Everything good Sunderland are doing is coming through him – Pritchard and Clarke have been quiet so far. 8.27pm BST 24 min That’s the thing, really: Luton can cause havoc simply by sticking the ball into the box, and it’s very hard for Sunderland to stop them from doing just that. 8.26pm BST 22 min And as I clip that, here come Luton, pumping the ball into the box, and when Patterson flaps at the cross, Morris heads goalwards, forcing O’Nien then Hume to hump off the line. Updated at 8.26pm BST 8.22pm BST 19 min Amad drills low and hard from the left, missing everyone in the box, then Roberts, backing up, drills back the other way. Sunderland have responded pretty well to conceding. 8.21pm BST 18 min Lockyer leaves one on Gelhardt and there’s minor shoving. It’s a great contest this, and if we’re lucky we might just get the kind of scenes that no wants to see. 8.20pm BST 18 min Gooch runs away from clark down the left, so cCark trips him, playground-style. He’s booked. 8.20pm BST 17 min Sunderland only got an allocation of 950 for this game, so a mate who’s gone could only take one of his sons. The seven-year-old was persuaded to stay at home with the offers of bolognese and cake, which sounds a decent win. 8.19pm BST 15 min This is lively now, Nakamba driving a lush pass out to Doughty down the right, catching Roberts out, but the volleyed cross is well held by Patterson. 8.17pm BST 13 min Almost! Roberts swings in and Ekwah is there at the near post, flashing a header that Horvath beats away superbly … but Ekwah seizes onto the loose ball, crossing, and it hits Bell on the hand! No penalty says the ref, and I think that’s right; there was no movement of arm to ball, and it wasn’t in an unnatural position. Sunderland players appeal unsuccessfully for handball. Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images Updated at 8.30pm BST 8.15pm BST 12 min There’s no reason to think Luton won’t create a few more chances very similar to that one, but in the meantime Sunderland have a corner of their own down the right. Can they make it count? 8.14pm BST GOAL! Luton (2) 1-0 (2) Sunderland (Osho 10) A good, inswinging cross, Lockyer makes sure he gets first contact, craning downwards and knocking the ball into the path of Osho, who needs to bites at it but lashes home from three yards. We have lift off! Gabriel Osho scores for Luton! Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport/Getty Images Updated at 8.17pm BST 8.12pm BST 10 min Bit of Luton pressure, Morris into Adebayo. He can’t make anything happen but his team sustain the attack and win a corner down the left… 8.12pm BST 8 min Amad chases one and trips over Osho, who was facing the other way. Again, no foul, but he’s starting to cause minor problems. 8.10pm BST 7 min Sunderland are trying to play out from the back, brave given Luton will step onto them and, on a narrow pitch, have less space to cover. They get the ball into Diallo though, who appears on the left and flicks to no one. 8.09pm BST 6 min Backwards and forwards goes the ball, no one able to find time on it. Updated at 8.09pm BST 8.08pm BST 4 min Gooch clears weakly and Morris spreads, but when Doughty zips across the face of the box, Gelhardt muscles through him and Sunderland counter, Amad going down in the box when he runs at Nakamba and Bell, trying to nip between them like a man racing onto a Tube as the doors close. He forlornly appeals for a penalty, but the ref is having no such thing and rightly so. 8.06pm BST 3 min Clarke runs at Gooch but quickly runs out of pitch. The game hasn’t settled yet, a sequence of humps and skews – which probably isn’t far off what Luton are after. 8.04pm BST 2 min Gelhardt catches Lockyer waiting on a ball to drop and barges him out of it, but Lockyer does just enough to win the free-kick. 8.04pm BST 1 min Kenilworth Road is perhaps the most higgledy-piggledy in the country, but when you’re this close to the pitch you can forget about aesthetics because you’re there. 8.03pm BST 1 min Away we go! 8.02pm BST Another little tussle going on tonight – join Michael Butler and follow that one. Related: Internazionale v Milan: Champions League semi-final second leg – live 8.00pm BST “I’ve lived here all of my life and been a Sunderland season ticket holder for 30+ years of it,” tweets Jen O’Neill, “and I don’t know anyone who would talk like that that isn’t from the north of Newcastle or Northumberland! It’s a quite guttural Toe-knee. Love your work, just me &amp; me fam were confused!” Yes, it was pointed out to me by a Mackem mate (he’s there tonight) who grew up in Newcastle. I wondered if it was specific to there, but wasn’t sure so went with the general. I have learnt. 7.59pm BST And here they come! Kenilworth Road is buzzing. 7.58pm BST Our teams are tunnelled. It’s tight in there… 7.57pm BST Related: As Southend face 18th winding-up petition, is there hope for the future? 7.57pm BST “The Football Weekly Derby!” hollers Joe Pearson. “OK, so Glendenning and Wilson are Sunderland supporters, but Faye Carruthers is a Luton fan. So 2-1 Sutherland, just like the current score. Let’s get it on!” 7.55pm BST That was a dreadful game, but I was at an even worse one at the Stade de Lit in October 2004 on my way to watch Man United at Ibrox. That was against Rotherham, finished 0-0, and is either up there or down there with the most dreadful I’ve ever seen. 7.53pm BST Just to be clear, I don’t know that kind of thing about everyone, more’s the pity; I was just there that night hanging about with a couple of mates one of whom supports Watford and the other Sunderland. I think Sunderland won 1-0. 7.50pm BST Kevin Phillips is pitchside for Sky, which reminds me of a perfect usage for a footballing “ironically”, so here goes: Kevin Phillips made his full debut for Watford in 1995 – ironically, against Sunderland. Updated at 7.53pm BST 7.47pm BST “Interesting to see how Sunderland’s wide players get on with the lack of space tonight,” emails Alan Johnson in Sunderland. “Amad and Roberts especially link well. Whereas Clarke is used to running into space. Expect them to attack down the right more than the left.” Yup, I think Sunderland will be wanting those two to gang up on Drameh, but as you say on a narrow pitch the space for that might be harder to arrange. 7.46pm BST Tom Lockyer says Luton always bounce back after defeats and they will tonight; Rob Edwards concedes Sunderland have an advantage, but is confident his players can produce. Mowbray knows his side will have to defend long balls and set-plays, but his team will look to get the ball down, play through midfield, and attack. He wants to get his wide attackers one-on-one, and to start fast. Dan O’Neil, meanwhile, notes that you don’t get many chances to play in the Premier League, which reminds us, as if we needed any such thing, just what this means to those charged with our entertainment. 7.43pm BST Both league games between the sides finished 1-1 while, this time last year, Luton were losing 2-1 on aggregate to Huddersfield in a tie they’ll think they should’ve won, while Sunderland were beating Wednesday by the same score before seeing off Wycombe at Wembley. 7.40pm BST Funny thing is, Luton’s formation necessarily forces Sunderland to go wide by bottling up the middle of the pitch. Against most teams, that makes a lot of sense, because it takes the ball away from the goal. I’m not sure how well it’ll work tonight, though. 7.33pm BST Luton will, I’m sure, be seeking to take advantage of Sunderland’s defensive situation. Their two up front could almost be designed to bully Hume and O’Nien, problem being their wing-back formation could leave them outnumbered out wide. In particular, Roberts and Amad down the Sunderland right could mean a lot of trouble for Cody Drameh and Gabriel Osho. 7.25pm BST I say these arrangements of what they have available because Sunderland’s back four is makeshift to say the least. Patrick Roberts is a winger and Lynden Gooch is a winger or wing-back, while Luke O’Nien and Trai Hume aren’t exactly specialist centre-backs. However, in attack they can damage any team, so the role of Pierre Ekwah and Dan Neil in protecting the men behind them and feeding those in front will be crucial. 7.12pm BST Both those sides are unchanged, which makes sense. Both managers are happy with these arrangements of what they have available. 7.09pm BST Let&apos;s have some teams... Luton Town (3-5-2): Horvath; Osho, Lockyer, Bell; Drameh, Ruddock, Nakamba, Clark, Doughty; Morris, Adebayo. Subs: Shea, Potts, Berry, Burke, Campbell, Onyedinma, Taylor. Sunderland (4-2-3-1): Patterson; Roberts, Hume, O’Nien, Gooch; Neil, Ekwah; Diallo, Pritchard, Clarke; Gelhardt. Subs: Bass, Lihadji, Ba, Anderson, Michut, Alese, Huggins. 6.30pm BST Preamble Oh man, how not to love the playoffs. Games split by days not a week, a whole year’s work on the line, and wildness almost guaranteed. It doesn’t happen often, but the football authorities do, occasionally, make decent decisions – though, let’s be real, if the side finishing fourth-bottom of the Prem were in this fighting for survival, this would be even more exciting. Luton are a ridiculous story, in the Conference as recently as 2013-14 following a 30 point deduction for financial irregularities – on the part of owners who should never have been allowed to buy the club – sent them down in 2008-09. Since then, though, they’ve got shot of bad owners and returned to the family ethos that served them so well in the 80s, steadily improving to arrive at this point and still playing in their division’s smallest, most archaic ground. They’re expecting to go up this season but if they don’t, they plan to soon.. Sunderland, meanwhile, a Premier League club in all but name, were only promoted into the Championship last season – ending a Wembley hoodoo in the process –and will be as surprised as they are delighted to find themselves in this position. And for that, credit must go to Terrknee Merrbrehy, who not only has the best name to say in a north-eastern accent but has cobbled together a team of youthful intensity and innocent enterprise that it’s impossible not to enjoy. If they don’t go up now, they could run away with it next season Saturday’s first leg was an extremely enjoyable affair, Luton the better side early on and well worth their early lead, just as Sunderland more than earned their eventual 2-1 win. Given their lack of defenders, though, there’s every chance the home side overturn the deficit … but given their surfeit of attackers, it’s equally likely they put the tie away. This is going to be great. Kick-off: 8pm BST</body>

    <head>Russia’s most potent hypersonic weapon neutralised, says Ukraine</head>
    <body>Ukraine has said it has neutralised the Kremlin’s most potent hypersonic weapon, shooting down six out of six Kinzhal missiles launched at Kyiv, but hours later it emerged the intense night-time attack had damaged a Patriot air defence system. Yurii Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air command, said Moscow had also bombarded the capital with nine Kalibr missiles and three ballistic rockets, as well as six attack drones and three reconnaissance drones. All were shot down, he said, thwarting what he called “air terrorism”. But the attack appeared to have damaged a US-made Patriot air defence battery, US sources told CNN later on Tuesday. Officials warned the system may have to be withdrawn entirely depending on the level of damage it had sustained. An assessment was ongoing, they added. The attack on Kyiv was one of the biggest since last year’s invasion and followed Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s three-day trip to Europe. During meetings in London, Berlin, Paris and Rome, Ukraine’s president secured promises of more military assistance, including long-range attack drones from the UK. Russia’s furious response came at 2.30am local time. Emergency sirens woke residents. Soon afterwards there were loud booms as Ukrainian air defences engaged incoming missiles. Tracer fire illuminated the sky and car alarms went off. There were growling explosions. A further air raid warning sounded at 4am.

Photograph: Gleb Garanich/Reuters Earlier, on Tuesday, the ministry of defence in Moscow said it had destroyed a US-supplied Patriot air defence battery. Serious damage to a Patriot would be a major blow to Ukraine’s air defences. Two Patriots, one donated by the US and one by Germany, arrived in the country around mid April, and have already been targeted previously by Russian missiles, in an effort to eliminate them. Although considered particularly effective, the Patriot is a relatively static air defence system, and is considered potentially vulnerable to high speed missiles. “We have received very powerful air defence systems from our western partners. They work against air dynamic targets. The Kinzhal X-47 missiles which used to terrorise us are not so scary any more,” Ihnat said. The raid was “unique” in its use of six Kinzhals from an estimated reserve of “about 50”. “The enemy has used a relatively big number of them,” he added. The combined attack in the early hours of Tuesday featured Shahed loitering drones arriving from the north, Kinzhals launched by MiG-31K fighter jets in the east and Kalibr missiles fired by Russian warships stationed in the Black Sea, he said. The shooting down of the Kinzhals, if confirmed, would be a powerful demonstration of the effectiveness of the newly deployed air defences. After a sleepless night during which many residents sought refuge in bomb shelters, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, issued an update on damage. He said there were three victims in the Solomyan district, which was hit by falling rocket debris. Rescuers extinguished blazes after vehicles caught fire. Debris fell on the suburbs of Darnytskyi and Obolonskyi, he said, as well as on Kyiv zoo. The zoo’s director, Kirill Trantin, said the remains of a shot-down rocket sliced through trees and landed next to enclosures containing vultures and a family of raccoons. He said he was a few hundred metres away at the time and had taken cover in a shelter with 20 other employees. People inspect missile fragments in the grounds of Kyiv zoo on Tuesday. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images “It was 2.50am. We heard a boom. It was very loud and very bright. There was no fire and fortunately no humans or animals were hurt. Police arrived and took away a part of the missile,” he told the Guardian. “The Russians don’t give a shit for the law or international norms. We’ve held on for over a year. We will beat them.” By morning the debris had been swept up, with the zoo opening to visitors as usual at 10am. The animals did not appear distressed but would be monitored over the coming days and if necessary given antidepressants in their water, the director said. In the meantime they would get extra apples and nuts. Trantin said Russia’s goal was to punish and terrify Ukraine’s civilian population into submission. He said 10 of his zoo colleagues were fighting with the Ukrainian army, including three in the city of Bakhmut. They had contacted him to see if he was OK, he said, adding that Ukraine needed better air defences. The zoo is a popular Kyiv attraction. One mother, Maryna, said she had taken her son Serhii to see the chimpanzees as a birthday treat. “He’s 11 today. Last night’s attack was terrible. But I promised to take him to the zoo and a promise is a promise,” she said. Zelenskiy said he had received “important and powerful” pledges of military aid during his European trip. Both the UK and France have announced they will soon start training Ukrainian pilots, and would work with other countries on the delivery of F-16 jets. On Tuesday the UK and Holland announced an “international coalition” to help procure the aircraft. Ihnat described F-16s as Ukraine’s fighter jet of choice. They could destroy cruise missiles and drones and would support Ukraine’s troops in a counteroffensive, expected this summer, and involving newly formed brigades equipped with western battle tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. “F-16s will protect us from air terrorism by Russia,” he said. Writing on Twitter, the UK’s ambassador in Kyiv, Dame Melinda Simmons, described the Russian bombardment of the capital as “full on” and “pretty intense”. She had just returned to Ukraine from the UK, where she accompanied Zelenskiy, who held talks on Monday with the prime minister in Chequers. A full on aerial attack on Kyiv last night, pretty intense. Bangs and shaking walls are not an easy night. Hope everyone is ok. — Dame Melinda Simmons (@MelSimmonsFCDO) May 16, 2023 The attack follows the provision by the government of long-range Storm Shadow missiles, which have a range of more than 250km (155 miles), and a British pledge to deliver long-range attack drones soon. The Kremlin has called the move “extremely negative” amid evidence Kyiv is already using Storm Shadows to hit Russian command and control centres away from the frontline. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, praised the “unbelievable success” of his air forces in the early hours of Tuesday. “Russian terrorists have no chance of prevailing over Ukraine. Their weapons can and should be countered by western ones,” he wrote. Another unbelievable success for the Ukrainian Air Forces! Last night, our sky defenders shot down SIX russian hypersonic Kinzhal missiles and 12 other missiles. 80-1-6=❌ russian terrorists have no chance of prevailing over Ukraine. Their weapons can and should be countered by… — Oleksii Reznikov (@oleksiireznikov) May 16, 2023 Meanwhile, fighting continued in eastern Ukraine. Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar on Tuesday said Ukraine had pushed Russian forces from the flanks of Bakhmut but conceded that Moscow’s forces were pushing deeper inside the embattled town.</body>

    <head>Luton turn tables on Sunderland to reach Championship playoff final</head>
    <body>At full time the Kenilworth Road pitch filled with incredulous fans, one of them claiming a shirt from the striker Elijah Adebayo and a few others setting off orange flares. Should any minor repairs be needed, Luton Town can add them to the £10m bill that would be required for ground renovations upon promotion and it is unlikely they will mind. One match lies between them and the top flight: for a club that was clawing its way out of the National League nine years ago it is a staggering achievement and, as the revellers eventually acceded to requests they return to the stands, the possibility of further celebrations on 27 May felt tantalisingly real. It will be a wonder if, upon waking up on Wednesday, any of the 9,000 raucous home supporters will have the capacity to vocalise exactly how this felt. Many of them waited for Rob Edwards’s players to emerge from the dressing room one last time to soak in the adulation, the manager greeting them with fist pumps and a thumbs-up. If the team had produced then their faithful had too, combining to create a blistering atmosphere inside this eccentric old venue and an environment Sunderland simply could not handle. Coventry or Middlesbrough will have to deal with the awesome energy and power of this Luton side at Wembley if this season is to be denied its greatest story. Related: PFA seeks advice on legal protections for players during pitch invasions “We had to mix it up and be horrible and dirty and that’s how we won the game,” said the Luton captain, Tom Lockyer, who barely lost a challenge in either penalty area all night. When Alfie Doughty swung yet another ball into Sunderland’s box two minutes before half-time it was Lockyer, the thought of coming second best never an option, who powered in and headed past a motionless Anthony Patterson. Luton had their second goal and an aggregate lead; it said everything about their spirit, steel and execution that they never looked like relinquishing it. With David Pleat and Mick Harford, now their chief recruitment officer, looking on they produced a night’s work to sit with the glory years of the 1980s. In losing narrowly at the Stadium of Light they had not fully exploited Sunderland’s aerial weakness, which was the result of a lengthy defensive injury list, but the lesson was heeded. From the opening whistle they hurled into challenges, pressed ferociously and, backed by a quite extraordinary din, asked questions of a makeshift back line. Crosses were flung in constantly; while Tony Mowbray’s visitors were technical and nimble, Luton overhauled them by bringing the chaos. It took only 10 minutes for their intensity to pay off. The award of a left-sided corner brought portentous roars and, when it was swung in by Jordan Clark, a Lockyer header was blocked. Gabe Osho swooped to stab in the loose ball, his finish the cue for pandemonium. By levelling the tie so quickly, Luton had the grip they craved.

Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Lockyer’s clincher came at the end of a whirlwind that Sunderland, craving the break, appeared to have seen off. Every delivery from the flanks caused discomfort, Patterson flapping at a Doughty cross and requiring a combination of Luke O’Nien and Trai Hume to clear off the line from Carlton Morris. Soon afterwards Morris forced Patterson into a spectacular save, Lockyer subsequently heading wide, and the striker was unfortunate a third time when flashing Adebayo’s centre just wide. “I thought we were exceptional, it was everything we want to be,” Edwards said. “We had the better chances, way more pressure, the lads worked their socks off.” That continued in the second half, Luton spending it on the front foot when many would have been cowed into dropping deeper. Clark should have punished another Patterson error and the stadium’s foundations shook from the roar when Cody Drameh, their right wing-back, chased the length of the field to win a corner from Jack Clarke. Prompted by the ubiquitous Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu and urged forward from the side, Luton were utterly relentless. A swamped Sunderland had no answer but could reflect on the moment, straight after Osho’s opener, when Ethan Horvath brilliantly repelled Pierre Ekwah’s near-post flick. When Ekwah drilled the rebound back across, they screamed for a handball by Amari’i Bell but nothing was given and VAR was not present. Amad Diallo tried to get them going but ultimately a stretched squad ran out of the steam needed for successive promotions. “We couldn’t really get them off our backs,” Mowbray said. “I’m proud of the team, how well they’ve done.” For Edwards, that feeling was multiplied several times over. He was sacked by Luton’s bitter rivals Watford in September and, taking over two months later, has emphatically shown his worth. “This group of players is special,” he said. “We’re one game away from the Premier League. It sounds surreal saying it, but it’s a fact.” Luton have every right to believe.</body>

    <head>Lautaro Martínez finishes off Milan to put Inter in Champions League final</head>
    <body>For Internazionale, the road to Istanbul was paved with bad intentions. The exuberance and colour of their first-leg victory gave way to something darker and grittier here: not so much a semi-final as a turf war, the sort of game that is to be endured rather than enjoyed. Here their great city rivals were snuffed out, dismantled piece by piece, and finally picked off via a goal by Lautaro Martínez. Milan is theirs. But the greatest prize of all remains tantalisingly within reach. Simone Inzaghi’s side will probably go into the final on 10 June as one of the least fancied Champions League contenders in recent history. And from the English perspective there is perhaps a tendency to gaze upon this wrought and wizened squad, with the 37-year-old Edin Dzeko up front and the 35-year-old Francesco Acerbi in the centre of defence, and wonder just how they got this far. But there is also a kind of deadly honesty to them: men of conviction, men of skill and steel, who over 180 minutes simply stood taller and made the braver decisions. Related: ‘Anything can happen’: Inter’s Inzaghi urges belief in Champions League final Dzeko was magnificent again: a colossal and utterly disruptive presence who seemed to run long periods of this game with his backside alone. So too Acerbi, a Milan native (and former Milan player) who has beaten bereavement, depression, alcoholism and testicular cancer to reach this point, and for whom this dominant and fearless performance helped to seal the most personal of triumphs. So too Martínez, now just a game away from winning the World Cup and Champions League in the space of six months. And so to Milan, a crashing disappointment who from the very first whistle last Wednesday never really looked like adding to their seven European Cups. Here again they were painfully lacking in pace and imagination, a team with 57% possession but just one shot in the second half, a team who offered only lethargy where urgency was required, a squad probably too thin and too inexperienced to challenge in two competitions at once. On the touchline Stefano Pioli, dressed immaculately in a suit and trainers like a man intending to run home from work, raged at the unfairness of it all. This has been a dispiriting campaign for Milan, their Serie A title defence crumbling after the winter break and now even the top four looking like a faint hope. This semi-final represented Pioli’s last chance of salvaging something from the season. Now it too has gone, there will be an increasing chorus of voices wondering whether Pioli is part of the solution or part of the problem. Lautaro Martínez fires in the second leg winner. Photograph: Alberto Lingria/Reuters They arrived in hope, buoyed by the return of Rafael Leão on the left wing, suited up for an Inter rearguard. But as the game went on the lack of poise in their build-up was painfully evident, the one-dimensional Olivier Giroud exposed and isolated. Leão had one decent sight of goal all night, a shot dragged wide. Brahim Díaz scuffed a wonderful opening in the first half, and in hindsight that was probably Milan’s best chance of shifting the feel of the tie. And when Inter got the ball, the field seemed to open out for them in the way it did not for their opponents. They were unchanged, but within that supple, ductile 3-5-2 system they can vary so much. Nicolò Barella played a more aggressive role than he had in the first leg, making late runs into the box, trying to latch onto the second balls from Martínez and Dzeko. Dzeko enjoyed Inter’s best chance of the half, flicking on a free-kick and forcing the supreme Mike Maignan to scrabble the ball away. The game turned a little scrappy in the second half, dead ends begetting dead ends, wrestles begetting wrestles. Dzeko’s backside was still running the show, at least until Inzaghi decided to substitute it for Romelu Lukaku’s backside. The Curva Nord beat out a frightening tribal rhythm. It felt like a countdown. Finally, with 15 minutes remaining, the bomb went off. Inter won the ball too easily on the left, worked it into the area virtually unchallenged, Lukaku and Martínez and Robin Gosens all exchanging it. Finally it came to Martínez, who jammed the ball in at the near post before running over to the advertising hoardings and standing atop them like a god on a pedestal. For the first time Inter could breathe, a gasp of air that felt as fresh and life-affirming as the very first. Will Pep Guardiola or Carlo Ancelotti endure any sleepless nights? Probably not. But then this is a club that has always done its best work in the shadow of doubt, that is most dangerous at the moment when you dare to write it off. Internazionale are not the world’s greatest football team, but they know who they are. As the flags waved triumphantly, a banner in the Curva Nord toasted gli amici che non di son piu: friends who are no longer with us. By contrast, it feels like one of the European Cup’s oldest friends has risen from its slab.</body>

    <head>Morning Mail: cost of tax cuts to soar, Biden cancels Australia visit, call to regulate AI</head>
    <body>Good morning. Our top story focuses on the ballooning costs of stage-three income tax cuts, with new analysis revealing they could rise to as much as $313bn over a decade – with the wealthy and men set to benefit the most. Meanwhile, NSW taxpayers are having to fund indemnity for organisations against child abuse claims. Plus: Joe Biden has had to cancel his Australian trip next week, and an antidote may have been found for the toxin in death cap mushrooms.

    <head>Gavin Newsom presidential run is ‘no-brainer’, Arnold Schwarzenegger says</head>
    <body>A presidential run by the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, is a “no-brainer”, according to one of the Democrat’s predecessors, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the film star and “governator” who ran the golden state for eight years from 2003. “I think it’s a no-brainer,” Schwarzenegger told the Hollywood Reporter in an interview published on Tuesday. “Every governor from a big state wants to take that shot.” Schwarzenegger also discussed his exercise regime and described how, at 75, he plans “to live forever”. Newsom, 55, is one of few names proposed as a credible alternative to Joe Biden, the 80-year-old Democrat in the White House – though such suggestions have quietened since Biden announced his re-election campaign. Shortly after election day next year, Biden will turn 82. Newsom can in all likelihood wait until 2028 to take his own tilt at the presidency, not least as his term in state office will end in 2027. First elected in 2018, Newsom steered California through the Covid pandemic but had to fight off a recall before winning re-election. Schwarzenegger, 75, said: “What do I think about his performance? When you become part of the club, you don’t criticise governors – because you know how tough the job is. It’s impossible to please everybody. “Before I ran for governor, I had an 80% approval rating. As soon as I announced, I had a 43% approval rating. Immediately, half of the people said, ‘Fuck him! I’m not going to see his movies anymore.’ “I would run things differently [than Newsom], but I’m a Republican, so of course I would. I don’t criticise him for not doing it my way.” Schwarzenegger earned the “governator” nickname, based on his famous roles in the Terminator films, when he won election as governor in 2003. He left office in 2011, unable to run for president because he was born in Austria. Asked for his view of Ron DeSantis of Florida, the leading Republican challenger to Donald Trump for the GOP nomination next year, Schwarzenegger was mildly critical. “I was against some of the stuff he did with Covid,” Schwarzenegger told the Reporter, of the governor who moved against mask and vaccine mandates and other public health measures. “But who am I to judge? That’s for the people of Florida. My style is different. His is too conservative for me. That doesn’t mean I think he’s terrible. He’s just not my style.” In a passage of possible interest to Biden, the Reporter asked Schwarzenegger about his own battle against the effects of age. “I never had cosmetic surgery,” he said. “I never tried any gimmicks. Years ago, I [went to] UCLA, where they have world-renowned experts on ageing. I asked if anything has been created, or that is about to be available, that reverses ageing. “He says, ‘Absolutely nothing, end of story.’ The only thing you can do is the old-fashioned stuff. I could wipe out earlier because I smoke cigars, but then it gets counterbalanced by me eating well and then exercising. “… I still work out every day, I ride my bike every day, and I make movies – show business is another part of my life. I add in my life, I never subtract. “I don’t need money. I get money because you have to have a certain value and the agents negotiate. But I have a great time doing it. I love everything that I do. There’s no retiring. I’m still on this side of the grass, so I’m happy. My plan is to live forever – and so far, so good!”</body>

    <head>Home Office minister heckled by victims of Windrush scandal</head>
    <body>A Home Office minister was heckled by people caught up the Windrush scandal during a heated meeting in Westminster called to draw attention to the slow progress in assisting those affected by the department’s mistakes. Simon Murray said it was “painful” to hear accounts from people describing their difficulties receiving documentation and compensation, five years after the government first apologised. He was greeted with some hostility and repeatedly interrupted by victims of the scandal, who shouted “gaslighting” and “we’ve heard this before” as he reiterated the government’s promises to deliver justice. “That was very painful for me to listen to but I wanted to hear it,” Lord Murray told the crowded meeting organised by Action for Race Equality. “It is important for me to hear it, as the government minister with responsibility for the Windrush compensation and status schemes.” He said that the government has now paid or offered more £70m in compensation, and that the compensation scheme was being constantly improved. “The victims of the Windrush scandal suffered a terrible injustice,” he added. “It is a shameful episode in our history.” Jeremy Crook, CEO of Action for Race Equality, noted that people affected by the scandal were still trapped overseas, unable to return to the UK because they did not have the correct documentation. Politicians, lawyers and Home Office staff were joined by people who are still fighting to put their lives back together, after finding themselves among the group of thousands of people who came to the UK legally as children from Commonwealth countries but were later misclassified by officials as illegal immigrants. The minister heard from several people who explained the complex ways in which their lives were ruined by the mistake. One man, who had to give up his career as a secondary school maths teacher after his right to work in the UK was questioned, said he had been offered a “derogatory sum” in compensation. “I wished the floor would open up for me to fall through it,” he added, remembering the moment when he was told how much he had been awarded. He called for the department to be more empathic. A former psychiatric nurse said she was unable to travel to visit her mother before she died because the Home Office lost her passport twice and then said they could find no record of her. “I couldn’t get to the funeral,” she said. “They need to sort this out.” One man described how his sister was still stuck in St Vincent because she was unable to trace documents proving that she had the right to live in the UK. The Labour MP Dawn Butler told the meeting: “The Windrush scandal was just an element of a wider state-sanctioned hostility that has been directed at black people for as long as I can remember. The Home Office is not an effective department; it is not competent.” Murray said he was greatly looking forward to June and the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Empire Windrush liner, “when we will celebrate the enormous contribution of the Windrush generation”. The campaigner Patrick Vernon said it would be a bittersweet celebration, adding: “There are thousands of people still locked in the Home Office’s maladministration.”</body>

    <head>Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim submits late £5.5bn bid to buy Manchester United</head>
    <body>Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani has made a dramatic fourth bid for Manchester United, with an improved offer of no more than £5.5bn which includes the clearance of the £1bn debt and a fund solely for the club and surrounding community. More than two weeks have passed since Sheikh Jassim and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the Ineos owner, each submitted what were supposedly final bids for United. The Qatari banker’s offer then was close to £5bn for 100%, while Ratcliffe’s was thought to be for a stake of a little over 50%, leaving Avram and Joel Glazer, two of the siblings who collectively own a majority share, with a 20% stake. Related: Sheikh Jassim: Manchester United suitor and ‘the elite of the elite’ But the Guardian understands that Sheikh Jassim’s intent on becoming United’s next owner moved him to increase his price by around £500m while clearing the debt and creating a fund solely for the club and surrounding community as he seeks to become the Glazers’ preferred bidder. The family originally valued the club at £6bn after it went on the market. Whether Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest people and also owns French club Nice, will respond is unclear. However, a third option may be that one or more of the Glazers retain their stake and take investment into the club, with the US firms Elliott Investment Management and the Carlyle Group interested in doing so. The Raine Group is orchestrating the sale for the Glazers.</body>

    <head>Cool response in Iceland as Rishi Sunak urges Europe’s leaders to back Rwanda plan</head>
    <body>Rishi Sunak has sought to convince European leaders to support his plans to detain and remove people to Rwanda – using a summit address to link the “lessons” of the Ukraine war to what he said was a need to confront threats such as illegal migration. Downing Street earlier hailed an agreement reached between Sunak and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to establish a new working arrangement to “strengthen cooperation” between the EU and the UK on migration. The arrangement would see British agencies working together with Frontex, the EU border force, on “critical operational and strategic challenges including the situation in the Channel”, a spokesman for Sunak said. The prime minister used his spot at the opening of the Council of Europe to push for cooperation to tackle illegal migration as he seeks to reassert his authority over the restless right wing of his party. Sunak said the dynamism of the European response to Russia had to be brought to bear on other issues, telling the Reykjavik summit: “We must also learn the lessons of this war by being prepared to confront threats to our societies before they become too big to deal with. “That includes acting on cybersecurity and AI and it means tackling illegal migration.” The moral case for action was clear, said Sunak, who went on to inject a Conservative electoral slogan into his address, telling the summit that more cooperation was needed across borders “to end illegal migration and stop the boats”. He had used discussions with other leaders, as well as a rare meeting with the president of the European court of human rights (ECHR), to seek backing for UK attempts to overcome rules that blocked the first scheduled deportation flight to Rwanda last summer. But others, including the Icelandic government – which is hosting the summit – played down the prospect of Sunak getting the agreement he wants to overcome the obstacles presented by the Stasbourg court. Icelandic foreign minister Thórdís Gylfadóttir Photograph: Oleksandr Gimanov/AFP/Getty Images Iceland’s foreign affairs minister said the summit would not be used to reform an order that prevented the first deportation flight to Rwanda from taking off. “The leaders are reconfirming their commitment to the common human rights protection system and, in particular, the court is a cornerstone of our protection system,” Thórdís Gylfadóttir told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme. “But the next two days, the time we have we are not using to reform certain articles in the court.” Tiny Kox, a Dutch politician who is the president of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly, also told the Guardian the UK could end up like Russia if it just ignores court rulings, as the British government wants to give itself the ability to do. “We are not a cafeteria, where you can ask for the verdict of the court that suits you,” he said. Sunak also held talks with the president of the ECHR, Síofra O’Leary, over a review of how rule 39 works – the order that blocked the inaugural flight to Kigali last year. People trafficking came up in his bilateral meeting with Dutch leader Mark Rutte, with whom he agreed to “tackle the scourge” by working together “both bilaterally and through forums such as the European Political Community”, according to No 10. Looming over the talks is the memory of Sunak caving in last month to demands from hard-right MPs to allow the UK to ignore rulings from the European court of human rights on small boat crossings. Backbench rebels had been pushing the PM to harden the illegal migration bill so ministers could ignore interim rulings. One of the Strasbourg court’s rule 39 injunctions blocked the government’s first attempt to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda last year. The Council of Europe summit officially opened later on Tuesday evening, following a rendition of Ode to Joy by an Icelandic brass band, where the country’s prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, said in her address: “The very concept of universal human rights continues to be contested.”</body>

    <head>Jeanne du Barry review – Cannes kicks off with Johnny Depp’s purring and peculiar royal dandy</head>
    <body>The rosebud lips of Johnny Depp in this film are pursed in a strange expression of irony, stupefied entitlement and droll, martyred awareness of the absurdity of which his royal person is the centre: a human candle starting to melt. He plays Louis XV in the decadent court of pre-revolutionary Versailles, purring his lines in French and playing him as the ageing, slow-moving dandy – though Rip Torn was sexier in the same role in Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette. Depp might actually have been better cast as the lead: Madame Jeanne du Barry, the low-born and entrancingly sensual mistress and royal favourite with whom the king was scandalously infatuated at court, permitting her all manner of familiarities and intimacies. Jeanne is in fact played by the movie’s director, Maïwenn, who has written the screenplay with Teddy Lussi-Modeste and Nicolas Livecchi. Mme du Barry is supposed to be a rebel, although apart from causing some flutter among the courtiers with her gender-dissident clothes, and of course by simply existing, she never seriously challenges anything about court life at all. (Like Coppola’s Marie Antoinette, incidentally, this film finishes well before the guillotine finale.) It is a preposterous confection of a movie, like one of the rich sweetmeats being languidly nibbled at court, but very moreish, nonetheless. It is handsomely furnished and costumed with blue-chip character actors in the supporting roles and some wonderful locations and interiors at the Palace of Versailles itself. Maïwenn plays Jeanne as a sexy, smart courtesan who reads books in the bath (did people in those days really bathe wearing a négligé?). Her first important conquest is the Comte du Barry, a fawning sybarite played by Melvil Poupaud, to whose sweet-natured and bookish son Adolphe she takes a platonic shine, tutoring him in philosophy and poetry. Du Barry sees the obvious social advantage in getting his mistress introduced at court to the king, who is now a widower, and while making a stately procession past an array of bowing flunkies at Versailles, Louis is struck by Jeanne’s beauty. He is impressed by the fearless, and yet somehow satirical way she meets his gaze, and curtsies in the way demonstrated by the Duchess of Sussex in the Netflix docuseries. Having been subject to a gruesome gynaecological inspection by the royal doctors, Jeanne is admitted to the kingly presence à deux; things proceed satisfactorily enough (although we are spared a sex scene) and soon they are gigglingly inseparable. This infuriates all the pompous stuffed chemises thereabouts – especially the king’s grownup daughters with the late queen, who are to be the ugly sisters to Jeanne’s Cinderella. But a problem arrives when the Dauphin (Diego Le Fur), later to be Louis XVI, makes his choice of bride: the comely Autrichienne Marie Antoinette (Pauline Pollman), who declines to acknowledge Jeanne at court, perhaps nettled by Jeanne’s wearing white to upstage her at Versailles. With the decline of the king’s health, Jeanne’s powerbase dwindles and calamity looms. Depp in Jeanne du Barry. Photograph: goodfellas The essential silliness of the film is part of its watchability, though perhaps Maïwenn is never quite sure how to handle Depp. Without this spectacular casting – although Depp is certainly good enough for it not to be simply stunt casting – Louis XV would just be an unsexy old guy, the royal sugar daddy, and much more emphasis would be placed on Jeanne’s political strategising. The presence of the preening Depp always insists on more than that – but Louis and Jeanne are not entirely credible as a love story, perhaps because of the cynicism in which they are both complicit and perhaps because the performances are a little opaque. It’s an entertaining spectacle, only partly aware of its own vanity. • Jeanne du Barry screened at the Cannes film festival.</body>

    <head>Ghanaian influencer charged in New York for allegedly scamming lonely seniors</head>
    <body>A high-profile Ghanaian Instagram influencer has pleaded not guilty to New York charges for her alleged role in several online “romance schemes” that targeted lonely seniors, court records indicate. Related: Social media firms should reimburse online fraud victims, say UK bankers Mona Faiz Montrage, who was arrested on 10 November in the UK and extradited to the US several days ago, was part of a West Africa-based “criminal enterprise” that targeted “vulnerable, older men and women who lived alone”, according to Manhattan federal prosecutors. Montrage, whose Instagram profile Hajia4Reall once had about 3.4 million followers, was one of the 10 most followed profiles in Ghana. The criminal outfit often sent victims emails, as well as text and social media messages, that tricked them into thinking they were in romantic relationships with someone, when in reality they were communicating with a scammer using a fake identity. Once the con artist cohort gained victims’ trust, they convinced them to send money to bank accounts under the false belief that they were controlled by their online paramours, prosecutors alleged. The criminals goaded their victims to send money under the guise of payments to send gold to the US from abroad, as well as money to help a US army officer get funds from Afghanistan. Montrage, prosecutors charged, used her real name with one victim and also spoke with them by phone. She allegedly sent this victim a tribal marriage certificate claiming to demonstrate they were married in Ghana, prosecutors allege. This victim transferred Montrage about $89,000 under the false pretense of assisting with costs involving her father’s farm in Ghana, prosecutors said. Montrage allegedly controlled bank accounts that took in more than $2m in illicit funds. Montrage is charged with six counts, on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, money-laundering conspiracy, money laundering, receipt of stolen money and conspiracy to receive stolen money. Montrage’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</body>

    <head>Twitter and Saudi officials face racketeering lawsuit over jailed satirist</head>
    <body>A US activist has filed a racketeering lawsuit against Twitter and senior Saudi officials on behalf of her brother, a Saudi aid worker who was forcibly disappeared – and then later sentenced to 20 years in jail – for using a satirical and anonymous Twitter account to mock the Riyadh government. The lawsuit by Areej al-Sadhan alleges that Twitter has become a “participant tool” in a campaign of transnational repression by Saudi authorities as part of the company’s effort to monetise its relationship with the kingdom. Saudi Arabia is Twitter’s second-largest investor, after Elon Musk. At the heart of the case lies the story of Areej’s brother, Abdulrahman, a former aid worker with the Red Crescent who has not been seen or heard from since 2021, when a Saudi court sentenced him to 20 years in prison and a 20-year travel ban for his use of Twitter. Related: Saudi Arabia jails alleged satirist ‘identified in Twitter infiltration’ The lawsuit, which was filed at the US district court in the northern district of California on Tuesday, contains critical new details about Abdulrahman’s story, including that the former aid worker created his anonymous Twitter account while living in the US. He did so, the complaint alleges, “in order to call out hypocrisy” in the kingdom’s ruling family. He then returned to Saudi in 2014, before being “kidnapped” by the kingdom’s “secret police” in March 2018. The lawsuit accuses Twitter of turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia’s systematic and documented repression of critics even though reports began to circulate about the kingdom’s “malign activities” using Twitter as early as 2018. US prosecutors have separately established that Saudi authorities illegally obtained confidential data about Twitter users between 2014 and 2015 from two covert Saudi government agents who were working for the company. The so-called Twitter spies targeted individuals like Abdulrahman, the suit alleges, who were posted critical or embarrassing information about Saudi Arabia and its royal family. The lawsuit alleges that, even as Twitter’s two Saudi employees – Ali Alzabarah and Ahmed Almutairi, who are now wanted by the FBI and are believed to be living in Saudi Arabia – were illegally obtaining confidential user data, Saudi Arabia was simultaneously increasing its equity stake in Twitter. The information submitted to Saudi authorities included the names, birthdates, device identifiers, phone numbers, IP addresses and IP session histories of the anonymous users. A jury in a federal court in California last year found that a third Twitter employee, Ahmad Abouammo, a dual US-Lebanese national who worked with the other spies, had acted as an unregistered agent of the Saudi government. The suit alleges that Abdulrahman’s family have learned new details about what had happened to the former aid worker, who was 38 years old when he was arrested at his office. According to the lawsuit, Abdulrahman’s sister Areej learned from informal sources that her brother had been tortured and held in solitary confinement for years. The suit also says she was told that the secret police “broke Plaintiff Abdulrahmam’s hand and smashed his fingers, taunting him that ‘this is the hand you write and tweet with”. The lawsuit also alleges that Areej has been targeted with online harassment and threats. The family spoke to Abdulrahman in 2020, the suit claims, two years after he had first disappeared. They got another call on 2 March 2021, in which Abdulrahman told his family he was going to be released from prison soon. Shortly thereafter, he was sentenced. Several cases have emerged over the last 12 months showing that several Saudis who previously lived abroad and then returned home have faced draconian decades-long jail sentences for charges that include using Twitter, and following or liking Tweets by Saudi dissidents. Twitter has repeatedly declined to comment about the cases to the Guardian. In 2021, a spokesperson for Twitter declined to comment on specific questions about Abdulrahman’s case but said the company had acted swiftly to cut off access to “malicious actors” using its user data as soon as it learned it had been infiltrated. “We cooperated closely with authorities during their investigation, which has resulted in several indictments in the United States. We simultaneously moved to notify and protect affected account holders. We remain committed to protecting the public conversation from abuse by state actors,” the company – which was not then under the ownership of Elon Musk – said in 2021. The Guardian received a poop emoji in response to a request for comment on Tuesday from Twitter’s press office, as is the company’s custom since Musk took over.</body>

    <head>Lucy Letby tells court ‘killing babies’ was not on her mind before holiday</head>
    <body>Lucy Letby has told jurors that “killing babies” was not on her mind at a time when she was looking forward to a holiday in Ibiza. The nurse is alleged to have attempted to murder a baby boy at the Countess of Chester hospital a day before she flew out to the Spanish island with a colleague and a friend. It is alleged she went on to murder a newborn triplet boy on her first shift back after her return, and then killed his brother the next day. Letby, 33, denies murdering seven babies and attempting to murder 10 others on the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. On Tuesday at Manchester crown court, her barrister, Ben Myers KC, asked her about an exchange of WhatsApp messages with a nurse, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, on 13 June 2016. Myers said: “You were going to have to go to work before you went away; how were you feeling about going to work?” Letby replied: “I was happy to go to work but I was also looking forward to time off and going on holiday.” Myers said: “In the middle of that were you planning on killing babies?” Letby said: “No.” Myers said: “That’s what the prosecution are saying.” Letby said: “That didn’t happen.” Letby denied first attacking Child N, a baby boy born with the blood clotting disorder haemophilia, in the early hours of 3 June. She said she was unaware that his blood oxygen levels had dipped during her shift before he made a relatively swift recovery. Twelve days later, on 15 June, Child N had a profound deterioration at 7.15am, the court heard. Letby said she had looked after Child N the day before and did not recall any concerns with him but his condition had deteriorated by the time she arrived for duty the next morning. The defendant said she was standing in the doorway of nursery room three when Child N’s monitor alarm sounded. She said: “I went over and found him to be mottled and not breathing properly. “He was a blueish colour. Straight away I started Neopuffing [using a breathing support] and called for help. [Child N] recovered from that episode within minutes and the same thing then happened again.” Earlier, Letby said she was in a different nursery when a doctor has alleged he saw her “doing nothing” when a baby girl collapsed on the unit. The defendant is alleged to have deliberately dislodged the infant’s breathing tube shortly before a consultant walked into nursery one. Giving evidence earlier this year, Dr Ravi Jayaram said he saw Letby standing by the incubator of Child K as her blood oxygen levels plummeted. On Tuesday, Myers asked: “Did you interfere with [Child K’s] tube?” “No,” replied Letby. Myers asked: “Was there a time when you were in the nursery and Ravi Jayaram came in and he found you to be standing there close to [Child K]?” Letby said: “No.” Child K was transferred later that day, 17 February, to Wirral’s Arrowe Park hospital, where she died three days later. The prosecution does not allege that Letby caused her death. Letby, from Hereford, denies all the allegations against her. The trial continues.</body>

    <head>Granit Xhaka poised for Arsenal exit with Leverkusen close to £13m deal</head>
    <body>Granit Xhaka is poised to leave Arsenal at the end of the season and Bayer Leverkusen are in advanced talks to sign the midfielder for €15m (£13m). The 30-year-old’s contract expires in June 2024 and there are no negotiations over an extension, with a parting of ways planned seven years after Xhaka joined from another German club, Borussia Mönchengladbach. The Switzerland international is close to an agreement over personal terms with Leverkusen on a four-year deal. Xhaka has played a major role in Arsenal’s title push, starting 34 of their 36 Premier League games and coming on as a substitute in one. The midfielder’s contribution amounted to “probably the best season he has had at the club”, Mikel Arteta said last Friday, but manager and player accept this is a good moment for the relationship to end. Xhaka has faced fierce criticism from Arsenal fans at times during his stay but he intends to depart on a positive note.</body>

    <head>Two poultry workers test positive for bird flu in England</head>
    <body>Two poultry workers have tested positive for bird flu after coming into contact with infected birds on the same farm in England, according to the UK Health Security Agency. The cases were picked up through a screening programme for people who have come into close contact with the virus, though neither individual suffered symptoms and both have since tested negative. Health officials said there were no signs of person-to-person transmission of the virus, which has spread dramatically in wild bird populations and affected other species, but added that contact tracing was being carried out for one of the workers as a precaution. “Current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we’re seeing circulating in birds around the world do not spread easily to people,” said Prof Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at UKHSA. “However, we know already that the virus can spread to people following close contact with infected birds and this is why, through screening programmes like this one, we are monitoring people who have been exposed, to learn more about this risk.” Based on the timing of the poultry workers’ exposure and their test results, the UKHSA said it believed one of the cases was not infected with avian flu, but had inhaled virus-containing material into their nose and throat that triggered a positive result on a nasal swab. In the second case, health officials have not ruled out an infection with the virus, though, as with the first case, the person may have inhaled virus that did not establish itself as an infection. The UKHSA said that person was the focus of an ongoing investigation and that precautionary contact tracing was undertaken. Both cases relate to the H5N1 strain of avian flu. The two cases are the latest since January 2022 when a person living in the south-west of England was found to be infected with avian influenza. The UKHSA found no evidence of onward transmission from the infected individual. The agency said the two new cases did not change the level of risk to human health, which remains “very low” for the general population. “Globally there is no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population,” said Hopkins. “It remains critical that people avoid touching sick or dead birds, and that they follow the Defra advice about reporting.” Health protection teams at the UKHSA make daily contact with individuals who are at high risk of exposure to avian flu to ask about any symptoms they may be experiencing. The latest two cases were detected through the agency’s asymptomatic surveillance programme, where poultry workers are asked to take nose and throat swabs which are tested for the virus for 10 days after exposure. Some workers are also asked to provide finger prick blood tests which the UKHSA checks for antibodies against avian influenza, which would point to an infection that has triggered the body’s immune defences.</body>

    <head>As Southend face 18th winding-up petition, is there hope for the future?</head>
    <body>Peeling from a boarded-up building outside Roots Hall is an old poster. It shows a glimpse of a possible future, the image that of a grand white stadium with a sweeping concourse and fans chatting before the match. Underneath there is a line that reads “making Southend proud” and above, the slogan “Bring it on!” Once perhaps an exclamation of joy, it now reads like desperation. On Wednesday Southend United face a winding-up petition in the high court, the result of unpaid taxes to HM Revenue &amp; Customs. It marks the 18th such petition in the 25 years that the chairman, Ron Martin, has owned the club and it is hardly their only problem. Staff have gone unpaid, fans have lent money that remains unreturned, the club is up for sale and in 2021 the Shrimpers were relegated from the Football League for the first time in 100 years. They remain in the fifth tier. Related: Guess the football stadium: planes, trains and automobiles edition “Previous experience suggests there will likely be enough evidence submitted for an adjournment of the petition,” says Robert Craven of the Shrimpers Trust, who has experienced more of these moments than likely is healthy. “But it’s also easy to be blase and personally I am quite fearful. There’s only so long you can keep treating people like Ron Martin does.” Shop fronts on Victoria Avenue by Southend’s Roots Hall ground. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian Southend are hardly the only English football club facing uncertainty, Wigan and Charlton being just two more prominent examples. On the surface, Southend’s story is also a familiar one. An owner who bought the club and made grand promises of a new stadium, with an equally aspirational training ground alongside. It was a package that would take the Shrimpers to the next level, it was argued, but decades later it has yet to arrive. Now, for the owner, the costs of running a club appear to have outweighed its benefits. “I think the fact that Ron Martin has put the club up for sale means he has recognised that we need to move on,” says Martin Terry, an independent councillor in the newly minted city of Southend-on-Sea, and season-ticket holder at Roots Hall. “We now need to find someone who wants to grow the club and who has the resources to do so. Like a lot of businesses in the country, there’s a cash flow problem. The fundamentals of the business are correct but we need someone to come in and resource it properly.” Southend did not respond to requests for an interview with Martin, nor answer questions submitted by the Guardian. Being blanked is also the current experience of the Southend Echo, which has doggedly pursued the plight of the club over the past few years. Craven describes the club’s recent fall, from League One to non-league in two years, as a “precipitous decline”. Martin’s history of making payment at the last minute – whether to the taxman or staff – is unpleasant. But neither Craven nor Terry is willing to entirely put the boot into Southend’s owner. Martin Terry remembers the whole country supporting Southend against Manchester United in 2006. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian “I’ve had moments at Roots Hall that were so exciting I can’t properly describe them,” Terry says. “The night we beat Manchester United here with Freddy Eastwood’s free-kick [in 2006], the entire nation was supporting us. Southend has a 100% record against Manchester United and that sort of thing gives the city something to think and dream about. Over the years we’ve had many glory days like that. It hasn’t all been bad, and some people have a short memory about it.” Terry also argues there have been a number of occasions where the new stadium project was about to achieve liftoff, only to be hit by last-minute problems – including the global financial crisis of 2008 and charges of tax fraud which were brought against Martin by HMRC in 2021 but were later dismissed. “I respect Ron Martin, but the reality is that he needs to let go and let someone else in,” Terry says. For Craven, there is a “complicated” relationship between owner and fans. “In 25 years we’ve had good times,” he says. “We had a season in the Championship and won the League One title [in 2006], one of only two championships in our history. But now for whatever reason if feels like he doesn’t have either the means or the inclination to run a football club. Some people would say he’s a villain, but I have concern over who the next owner might be.” Southend’s Freddy Eastwood (left) fires a free kick past Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney and David Jones (right) to score the only goal of the game during their Carling Cup fourth round win at Roots Hall in November 2006. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters There are fans who have no truck at all with Martin, however, and they like to call him “Teflon Ron”. As the name suggests, they feel he should bear more responsibility for the club’s failings. “Nothing sticks with him,” says a representative of the recently formed Southend Fan Protest Group. “He’s really good at making out like he’s a nice guy and every time something comes up he manages to wriggle his way out of it, but we don’t think even he is sure he’s got the money to bridge the finances this time.” The SFPG is largely comprised of younger fans and they take a direct approach to protesting against Martin’s ownership. They have led marches through the high street before matches and, last weekend, were picketing outside Martin’s house. “The original assumption was that we were just Stone Island-wearing, Kopparberg-drinking teenagers throwing abuse at Ron Martin,” the SFPG says, “And, yes, there was a bit of that. But we are on a hearts and minds campaign now; we want to raise awareness.” The factions of the fanbase may differ in their assessment of the club’s plight, as might their response to it, but there is alignment too. They all insist upon the importance of the club to the broader community, and all would like Southend to come under some kind of fan control. A poster shows what Southend United believed they could become. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian The SPFG says the trials of Southend United create an “air of depression and exhaustion” in the city, where “now, more than ever” football is a part of people’s identity. For Terry, the club can be a rallying point for a community split between commuters from London and those in traditional seasonal work along the Essex coast. He, like Craven, also sees opportunities for the city in terms of tourism should the club become upwardly mobile. All have followed the debate around the government white paper into football governance and the possibility of a regulator that would enshrine some fan involvement in the running of the clubs they belong to. Terry says he is in favour of a German model of majority supporter ownership, while the SPFG is radical enough to be ready to see the club go into administration if it meant fan ownership at the end of it. Craven and the Shrimpers Trust, meanwhile, may be mocked by the SPFG as having effectively become Martin’s volunteer workforce, but are also acknowledged as having been effective in their work. “It just shows that fans could run the club,” the SFPG says. Despite the travails, Southend finished just outside the National League playoffs in a year dominated by the heavyweights of Wrexham and Notts County. Disaster is not a given. Should a solution to the question of Martin’s ownership be found, it is also clear there are people ready to step in with ideas and energy. They all hope they have caught the scent of change on the sea air.</body>

    <head>The Guardian view on the cost of living crisis: Labour needs creative solutions</head>
    <body>The sharp fall in disposable income among UK households has been blamed on the war in Ukraine, supply chain problems and Conservative policies. It is a product of all these things. But it is also a symptom of a longer decline in living standards that predates them. In response, both the Conservatives and Labour have proposed variations on the same programme of growth and jobs. Yet what if this emphasis is neglecting another essential area: the everyday goods and services that we all depend upon? This is the argument advanced by academics in a new book, When Nothing Works. Living standards aren’t just determined by income or wage growth – they also depend upon people’s access to essential infrastructure and services, such as housing, transport and energy. Rather than ensuring that these goods are available and affordable to everyone, the government has instead fixated on work as the main route for lifting people out of poverty. Its punitive benefits system has pushed more people into low-paid work but has not protected them from falling below the minimum needed to survive. Meanwhile, because many essential services have been outsourced to the market, their costs have escalated – and households are struggling. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dysfunctional rental market. Government spending on housing benefit has risen by around 40% since the mid-1990s, yet this has not prevented people from falling into poverty. So long as landlords continue to drive up rents and social housing remains scarce, private renters will be playing catch-up, and the government will either have to accept an ever-increasing housing benefit bill or leave people exposed to high housing costs. It has opted for the latter, freezing local housing allowance in England. In the UK, the housing overburden rate for low-income private tenants – the percentage of them who spend more than 40% of their income on rent – is 53%, more than three times the rate in Germany. High housing costs deepen poverty. In Scotland, for example, where housing is relatively affordable, rates of child poverty are lower. An easy way to protect people from these costs would be unfreezing local housing allowance. But a future Labour government should go further. A better solution to the cost of living crisis would be providing universal access to the services and goods that form the bedrock of prosperity. This would mean building more social housing and curbing soaring rents with reforms such as rent controls. In other areas of life, it could mean making nutritious food cheaper by subsidising it, giving children free school meals, or providing free internet access. In 2018, Rachel Reeves wrote a pamphlet calling for a focus on the “everyday economy” – the services and social goods that sustain our daily lives. Five years is a long time in politics. Although Labour has made gestures towards transformative reforms, such as its pledges to create a national energy company and support a community right to buy, its economic agenda is framed overwhelmingly in the conventional language of growth. The shadow cabinet seems reluctant to focus on questions of economic power, lest these be interpreted as a Corbyn-era hangover. But there are many examples of progressive experiments that it could learn from within its own party, such as Sadiq Khan’s free school meals policy in London or Paul Dennett’s municipal housing company supplying affordable homes for rent in Salford. The challenge for Labour should lie in scaling these up.</body>

    <head>The Guardian view on Thailand’s elections: can the country move forward?</head>
    <body>Careful what you wish for. The Thai royalist-military establishment has spent years attempting to suppress the political forces that swelled around the billionaire businessman Thaksin Shinawatra. Instead of addressing the social roots of his populist appeal to rural Thais and the urban poor, it has used two coups, court cases and ruthless suppression of dissent to see off the tycoon and his proxies. The military has remained in power since removing his sister as prime minister in 2014. Yet in Sunday’s election, Pheu Thai, the latest party associated with him, was eclipsed only by a new progressive party demanding military- and monarchy-related reform. The results are not even a landslide, says one political analyst, but a skyfall. The poll ruptured the division of Thailand into establishment “yellow shirt” and Thaksin “red shirt” supporters. The new Move Forward party took 14m votes and 151 seats by winning over young urbanites who would recoil from the former prime minister, a polarising figure convicted of corruption in absentia and with a dismal human rights record in office. It also picked up some support from Pheu Thai, now fronted by his daughter, which still took 9m votes and 141 seats. Together, the opposition have trounced the political establishment and agreed to form a coalition government. That does not mean they will be able to do so. Move Forward’s predecessor, Future Forward, placed third in 2019’s election but was dissolved, with its leader disqualified as an MP. A similar bid is afoot against Move Forward’s Pita Limjaroenrat. To become prime minister he needs support from military-appointed senators as well as elected MPs; several of the former have said they will not back him. And if the elite allows Move Forward to proceed, it will be poised to exploit – or foment – crises that can bring down a government. Thaksin, who has said he will return from self-exile, rose by tapping into deep-rooted grievances about glaring inequalities. Beyond piecemeal subsidies and handouts, the elite has done little to counter his offer. The 2014 coup was a turning point for many younger Thais. If their parents have seen the military as a source of stability, they see it erasing their future through increasingly authoritarian rule and an economic slump. Then came the royal succession in 2016. King Maha Vajiralongkorn lacks the moral authority accorded to his father, and has centralised wealth and power. Use of harsh laws against insulting the monarchy helped to provoke previously unthinkable protests against royal power and privilege. While the old order tries to drag Thailand back towards a deferential past, voters are looking to the future. They see themselves as citizens, not subjects. Even Pheu Thai’s machine politics and materially focused messaging looks old-fashioned to many – and rumours that it might form a pact with a minor military party boosted Move Forward, which has vowed to rein in the military, take on the oligarchs and amend the lese-majesty laws. As the political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak observes, “The more foul play that unfolds, such as military takeovers, party dissolutions and the disqualifications of elected representatives, the likelier it is that street demonstrations return.” The old playbook is not working, and the failures are more striking each time. Thaksin was a symptom. The elite’s real problem is themselves.</body>

    <head>Asylum seekers in England and Wales to lose basic protections in move to cut hotel use</head>
    <body>Ministers are removing basic housing protections from asylum seekers under new rules designed to move tens of thousands out of hotels and into the private rented sector. The changes would exempt landlords from regulations governing everything from electrical safety to minimum room sizes, leading campaigners to warn that the government is preparing to cram people into small spaces in an effort to alleviate the crisis in asylum seeker accommodation. MPs are set to vote as soon as Wednesday on the plans, which have been put forward by Suella Braverman, the home secretary, and Michael Gove, the housing secretary. Under the changes, landlords of asylum seekers in England and Wales would no longer have to register with local authorities. The rules would allow landlords to house asylum seekers for two years without obtaining a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence, a standard requirement for any landlord renting to more than one household in a single property. Mary Atkinson, a campaigns and network manager at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “HMO licences exist to make sure that accommodation meets basic levels of safety and sanitation. However, much asylum accommodation already falls below these standards, with people seeking sanctuary housed in cramped, windowless rooms smaller than prison cells. “Without HMO licences, already traumatised people will be at risk of living in places that are unfit for human habitation.” Gove is pushing the rules through the Commons at the request of Braverman as the government scrambles to reduce the number of people being temporarily housed in hotels. He plans to bring them to a vote in the Commons with little fanfare on a day that will otherwise be dominated by the publication of his bill to ban landlords from evicting tenants without cause. Massive backlogs in the asylum processing system have led to more than 50,000 asylum seekers being housed in hotels across the country, at a cost of £6m a day. Meanwhile, cramped and unsanitary conditions in temporary accommodation have led to outbreaks of highly contagious diseases such as diphtheria. The temporary solutions have caused alarm among healthcare workers and migration campaigners. But they have angered a number of Conservative MPs, who say they are putting pressure on local communities and services. Braverman is already planning to house asylum seekers on redundant cruise ships, barges and ferries in an effort to ease the crisis. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak is using a meeting of the Council of Europe in Iceland to lobby his European counterparts to reduce the ability of the European court of human rights to block asylum seeker deportations. Ministers hope that removing housing regulations for private landlords will also speed up the transfer of people away from hotels. A government spokesperson said: “By temporarily removing this licensing requirement, we will be able to acquire more suitable long-term accommodation while continuing to meet our legal duty of care.” The abolition of the rules means that landlords of asylum seekers, many of whom use large service companies such as Serco to run their properties, will no longer have to provide gas or electrical safety certificates before tenants move in. They will not be asked to supply documents on demand to show that electrical appliances and furniture are safe and usable. And they will not have to comply with standards that require under-10s to have a room at least 4.6 sq metres and over-10s to a room of at least 6.5 sq metres. Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “Licensing for HMOs was brought in to keep people safe. By doing away with these protections in order to flex minimum space standards, the government is putting thousands of people, including children and older people, at serious risk.” Braverman used a speech to the National Conservatism conference this week to argue for lower migration, despite pressure from some of her cabinet colleagues to allow more people to come to the UK to boost the economy. Gove gave the home secretary his backing on Tuesday, telling the same conference that migration was a key reason for the UK’s housing crisis – despite evidence that his own watering down of housing targets is set to drive housebuilding to the lowest level in decades. Gove said: “Britain’s always been a country that has benefited from people of talent arriving here and people fleeing persecution, but the numbers recently have been at a level where there’s an inevitable pressure on housing and on public services.” The changes explained What is a HMO? A house in multiple occupation is any home rented out to three or more tenants from more than one household. This applies whether it is a house or a block of flats, and requires landlords to register with their local council. What are the licensing requirements? Landlords renting out an HMO must provide: A gas safety certificate every year. Working smoke alarms for every inhabited storey. If requested, a declaration that electrical appliances and furniture are safe. Written statement of the terms of occupancy to tenants. A carbon monoxide alarm in every inhabited room with a gas or oil heater. A declaration from a qualified electrician that electrical fittings are safe. Bedrooms that are at least: – 6.51 sq metres for a room used by one person aged 10 or over. – 10.22 sq metres for a room used by two persons aged 10 years or over. – 4.64 sq metres for a room used by one person aged under 10 years. What will the new rules mean? The government will still have some oversight of landlords who rent to asylum seekers, because civil servants will sign off on their contracts. But campaigners say the Home Office has already proved it is unable to provide safe and sanitary asylum accommodation, after outbreaks of diphtheria at hotels and the Manston holding facility in Kent. • This article was amended on 16 May 2023. The headline of an earlier version referred to the UK instead of England and Wales. Also Rishi Sunak was at a Council of Europe meeting in Iceland, not Finland.</body>

    <head>Reporter blackmailed the Mirror as it tried to cover up phone hacking, court told</head>
    <body>A leading Mirror journalist allegedly blackmailed the company as it attempted to cover up phone hacking, the high court has been told. Lee Harpin, who held a number of senior roles at the People and Sunday Mirror, was alleged to be a known phone hacker whose understanding of illegal behaviour at the newspaper group caused anxiety at board level. Harpin, who is now the political editor of Jewish News, told the Guardian: “I categorically deny the allegations. No one has contacted me from either side to give evidence so I have not been given a chance to respond to these outrageous allegations.” The claims were made in a witness statement to the phone hacking trial by Brian Basham, an investor and PR executive. He told the court on Tuesday he extensively researched the Mirror’s involvement in phone hacking and shared his findings with the company’s executives and media reporters. Brian Basham arriving at court on Tuesday. Photograph: Neil Mockford/GC Images Prince Harry and more than 100 other claimants allege there was a widespread culture of phone hacking and other illegal activity by journalists at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the People newspapers over several decades. The court heard Basham went for lunch with David Grigson, the Mirror’s then-chairman, in 2012 and advised him to “clear the decks” on phone hacking to avoid being swept up in the same scandal as the News of the World. At that time the Mirror was still publicly insisting its journalists had not been involved in phone hacking. Basham told the court that senior staff, including board members of the listed company, were aware that voicemail interception had been widely used by its journalists. He claimed the company’s lawyers were openly making jokes about checking mobile phone messages to “widespread laughter” in the newsroom. He also alleged that the former Mirror chief executive Sly Bailey, who was in charge when phone hacking is alleged to have been at its peak, “had orchestrated a cover-up”. He said Bailey had “bullshitted her way around a lot, and that investors had been misled”. Basham said his research into the Mirror later led him to conclude the board was particularly concerned by Harpin, whom he described as “the phone-hacking ‘dauphin’, or heir apparent”. Harpin was arrested on suspicion of phone hacking while working at the Mirror in 2015 but was never charged. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped its phone hacking investigations into dozens of journalists after concluding there was “insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction”. Basham alleged that, around this time, Harpin “was blackmailing the company to prevent them from penalising him for his phone-hacking activities by threatening to blow the whistle on everything he knew about their phone-hacking problem if they did”. The Mirror’s barrister suggested Basham was defaming individuals on the basis of anonymous sources. Mirror Group Newspapers has already paid out more than £100m in settlements and legal fees for phone hacking. It is fighting four test cases, including Harry’s, because it disputes their evidence. It also argues the claims have been filed too late. The court is continuing to hear evidence from witnesses in the seven-week trial, with the Duke of Sussex expected to give evidence at the start of June.</body>

    <head>Ukraine claims to have retaken 20 square km of land around Bakhmut – as it happened</head>
    <body>6.42pm BST A summary of today&apos;s developments Ukraine has said it has neutralised the Kremlin’s most potent hypersonic weapon, shooting down six out of six Kinzhal missiles launched at Kyiv during a sweeping and “exceptionally intense” night-time attack. The attack on Kyiv was one of the biggest since last year’s invasion and followed Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s three-day trip to Europe. During meetings in London, Berlin, Paris and Rome, Ukraine’s president secured promises of more military assistance, including long-range attack drones from the UK. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, claimed Kyiv’s defenders shot down 18 out of 18 Russian rockets and drones. The city had came under an intense and sweeping attack from the “north, south and east”, featuring missiles fired from air, sea and land, he said. Among the areas affected by falling debris in Kyiv was the city’s zoo. In response, Russia’s defence ministry has said it has destroyed a US-built Patriot surface-to-air missile defence system overnight with a hypersonic Kinzhal missile attack on Ukraine, the Zvezda military news outlet reports. This has not been independently verified by the Guardian. Ukrainian forces have taken back about 20 square km (7.5 square miles) of territory from Russian forces around the eastern city of Bakhmut in recent days, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Tuesday. She said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had advanced “somewhat” in the city of Bakhmut itself, and that heavy fighting continued. The head of Ukraine’s supreme court Vsevolod Kniaziev has been arrested as part of the biggest bribery investigation in the country’s history. Police detained Knaiziev as part of a $2.7m bribery inquiry, as Kyiv pursues anti-graft measures required for closer integration with the EU. Omelchenko said two people, including Kniaziev, had been detained as part of the investigation but declined to identify the second individual. A group of judges within the supreme court were likened to a “criminal group”. Six African leaders plan to travel to Russia and Ukraine “as soon as is possible” to help find a resolution to the war, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Tuesday. Russian president Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy have “agreed to receive the mission and the African heads of state, in both Moscow and Kyiv,” Ramaphosa said. A bill banning Russian uranium imports to the US gained momentum on Tuesday by passing a committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the US banned imports of its oil and imposed a price cap with other Western countries on sea-borne exports of its crude and oil products, but it has not banned imports of its uranium. About 2,000 people who had helped defend the Azovstal plant who were captured and became prisoners of war are still in the hands of the Russians, according to a charity set up to support families and those connected to the factory. Six people have been killed in Kharkiv and Donetsk over the last 24 hours, according to the region’s governors. Oleh Syniehubov and Pavlo Kyrylenko confirmed the figures on Tuesday. Russia has said it is still undecided on the extension of a landmark Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine, brokered by the UN and Turkey and due to expire 18 May. “There are a lot of unanswered questions regarding our part of the deal … now we have to make a decision,” the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 6.39pm BST Ukraine does not have enough military equipment to launch a counteroffensive against Russia, the deputy head of President Zelenskyy’s office said. Ihor Zhovkva said his country needs armoured vehicles and tanks if it is to “liberate” areas captured by Moscow. He added that the “primary object” of Zelenskyy’s visits to European neighbours including the UK, Germany and Italy in recent days was to request “additional military packages”. Zhovkva told Sky News: “Unfortunately, the level of equipment we have is not yet enough to start the counteroffensive. “To start a counteroffensive, with the result being the liberation of Ukrainian territories, you need enough artillery systems and ammunition. You need armoured vehicles and tanks. “We want this counteroffensive to be as successful as possible. “Success would be liberating all the captured areas of Ukraine.” 6.25pm BST A bill banning Russian uranium imports to the US gained momentum on Tuesday by passing a committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the US banned imports of its oil and imposed a price cap with other Western countries on sea-borne exports of its crude and oil products, but it has not banned imports of its uranium. “The war in Ukraine has made it abundantly clear we cannot be at the whims of Russia for our fuel supply,” said representative Jeff Duncan, the chair of the committee. “It should be a bipartisan, national security objective to wean the United States industry off Russian uranium imports.” A similar bill has been referred to the energy committee in the U.S. Senate. Before becoming law, the legislation would have to pass both chambers of Congress and be signed by president Joe Biden, Reuters reports. 6.10pm BST Ukrainian soldiers carry the coffin of Ukrainian serviceman Volodymyr Nestor, killed in combat with Russian troops, during his funeral at a cemetery in Lviv on Tuesday.

Photograph: Yuriy Dyachyshyn/AFP/Getty Images 5.48pm BST The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will step up calls for a special tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression. Speaking ahead of a summit of European leaders in Reykjavik on Tuesday, Von der Leyen said “accountability of Russia for the crime of aggression” would be a big topic. Earlier this week, she promised to “strongly support the creation of a dedicated tribunal to bring Russia’s crime of aggression to trial”. Leaders from across the continent are meeting in the Icelandic capital for a Council of Europe summit, only the fourth in the body’s 74-year history. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Olaf Scholz, Emmanuel Macron, Rishi Sunak and Von der Leyen are to give speeches later on Tuesday. Russia was expelled from the Council of Europe last March after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Moscow had announced its intention to withdraw from the continent’s leading human rights body the day before its expulsion, after the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly called for its withdrawal.

Russian president Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy have “agreed to receive the mission and the African heads of state, in both Moscow and Kyiv,” Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa said he had held “separate telephone calls” with Putin and Zelensky over the weekend, where he presented an initiative drawn up by Zambia, Senegal, the Republic of Congo, Uganda, Egypt and South Africa. “I agreed with both President Putin and President Zelensky to commence with preparations for engagements with the African heads of state,” Ramaphosa said. “We’re hoping we will have intensive discussions,” he said, speaking at a press conference in Cape Town during a state visit by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loon according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Ramaphosa did not give a specific timeline for the visit or other details, saying only that the conflict had been “devastating” and Africa “is also suffering a great deal” from it. African countries have been badly hit by rising prices of grain and by the impact to world trade. 4.08pm BST Luke Harding has an updated dispatch from Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, the night after a barrage of missile attacks by Russia. Ukraine has said it has neutralised the Kremlin’s most potent hypersonic weapon, shooting down six out of six Kinzhal missiles launched at Kyiv during a sweeping and “exceptionally intense” night-time attack. Yurii Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air command, said Moscow had also bombarded the capital with nine Kalibr missiles and three ballistic rockets, as well as six attack drones and three reconnaissance drones. All were shot down, he said, thwarting what he called “air terrorism”. The attack on Kyiv was one of the biggest since last year’s invasion and followed Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s three-day trip to Europe. During meetings in London, Berlin, Paris and Rome, Ukraine’s president secured promises of more military assistance, including long-range attack drones from the UK. Russia’s furious response came at 2.30am local time. Emergency sirens woke residents. Soon afterwards there were loud booms as Ukrainian air defences engaged incoming missiles. Tracer fire illuminated the sky and car alarms went off. There were growling explosions. A further air raid warning sounded at 4am.

The 140-2 vote move paves the way for chief justice Vsevolod Kniaziev dismissal from the court but does not strip him of his status as a judge, Ukrainian media said according to Reuters. 3.42pm BST About 2,000 people who had helped defend the Azovstal plant who were captured and became prisoners of war are still in the hands of the Russians, according to a charity set up to support families and those connected to the factory. Natalka Zarytska, who is in charge of the council of wives and mothers, women of Steel said on the one-year anniversary of the withdrawal from the plant that 500 had returned home, but many are still prisoners of war. She said: “Despite all efforts, only 20% of the defenders, who stood to the death until they received an order from the command to lay down their arms and save their lives, were able to return over the past 12 months. “Only the defenders of Azovstal received such an order during the war. According to information from open sources, fulfilling the order, about 2,500 defenders left the territory of the plant. “Over the year, about 500 defenders were returned. This means that about 2,000 boys and girls are still in the hell of captivity, and together with them, their relatives and friends have been in the hell of uncertainty for the whole year.” According to the Ukrinform news website she said that servicemen had been tortured and starved in captivity. Those who returned in a prisoner swap in September returned having lost about 40kg in weight. 3.30pm BST Ukraine claims to have retaken 20km of land around Bakhmut Ukrainian forces have taken back about 20 square km (7.5 square miles) of territory from Russian forces around the eastern city of Bakhmut in recent days, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Tuesday. She said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had advanced “somewhat” in the city of Bakhmut itself, and that heavy fighting continued. She said: “The enemy is advancing somewhat in Bakhmut itself, completely destroying the city with artillery. In addition, the enemy is raising units of professional paratroopers. “Heavy battles continue with different results. In the current situation, our troops are doing their best and even more. “The fact that the defence of Bakhmut lasts for so many months and there are advances in certain areas is the strength of our fighters and the high level of professionalism of the defence command. “I will remind you that the enemy has an advantage in the number of people and weapons. At the same time, thanks to the actions of our military, he has not been able to implement his plans in the Bakhmut direction since last summer.” 3.15pm BST The International Rescue Committee has urged Russia and Ukraine to extend the Black Sea grain deal, with a wider access to more Ukrainian ports. The humanitarian aid charity said it would reduce pressure on food prices, with the situation particularly affecting east Africa. The extension of the agreement is “critical” for the Ukrainian farmers, the IRC said. It said they are still facing difficulties selling their grain due to disruptions in logistics chains, and blockage of seaports. Shashwat Saraf east Africa emergency director at the IRC said Shortages of food in the system and lack of affordable fertiliser continues to push up prices, making it difficult for families in countries like Somalia to predict if they will be able to afford a meal the next day. Agricultural production is in decline – farmers in Ukraine are struggling to keep their harvests alive amidst active shelling, while climate change is killing crops in other parts of the world that need them most. Any shock to the markets can cause massive harm with catastrophic ripple effects in countries balancing on the brink of famine. The expiration of the Black Sea Grain Initiative is likely to trigger increased levels of hunger and malnutrition, spelling further disaster for east Africa. 3.04pm BST Here’s an insight into the feeling Kyiv after Russia’s large-scale rocket attacks on the Ukrainian capital overnight. A mixture of bewilderment and euphoria, according to the Economist’s Oliver Carroll. Remarkable atmosphere in Kyiv today. People walking around like sleep deprived zombies, but occasionally smiling maniacally at each other for having got through * that * night. Hopefully it continues. — Oliver Carroll (@olliecarroll) May 16, 2023 2.31pm BST Agence France-Presse (AFP) has more on the arrest of the head of the supreme court, Vsevolod Kniaziev, in Ukraine as part of the biggest bribery investigation in the country’s history. Police have detained the head of Ukraine’s supreme court in a $2.7m bribery inquiry, as Kyiv pursues anti-graft measures required for closer integration with the EU. “The head of the supreme court has been detained,” Oleksandr Omelchenko, a prosecutor with Ukraine’s anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, told reporters in Kyiv. Omelchenko said two people, including Kniaziev, had been detained as part of the investigation but declined to identify the second individual. “This is the biggest-ever case” implicating the judiciary, said the head of Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), Semen Kryvonos. Kryvonos likened a group of judges within the supreme court who were implicated in the investigation to a “criminal group”. Anti-corruption officials say the Ukrainian billionaire Kostiantyn Zhevago had offered the bribe to court officials, with a law firm acting as intermediary. Anti-corruption officials said Zhevago had transferred $2.7m to the lawyers, of which $1.8m was to be paid to supreme court justices and $900,000 to lawyers for their “services as intermediaries”. They said Zhevago had hoped to bribe the court to issue a ruling allowing him to keep control of the shares of a mining company that is at the centre of a dispute with former shareholders. Zhevago, a former member of the Ukrainian parliament and one of the country’s richest men, is currently in France, and Kyiv is attempting to secure his extradition. He was detained in France in December on suspicion of money laundering and embezzling funds linked to his banking business at home. Updated at 2.39pm BST 1.38pm BST The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said on Tuesday that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy had agreed to meet a group of African leaders to discuss a potential peace plan for the conflict. Reuters reports that details of the plan have not been publicly divulged, although Ukraine’s stated position for any peace deal is that all Russian troops must withdraw from its territory. “My discussions with the two leaders demonstrated that they are both ready to receive the African leaders and to have discussion on how this conflict can be brought to an end,” Ramaphosa told a joint press briefing with the Singaporean prime minister in Cape Town. “Whether that will succeed or not is going to depend on the discussions that will be held,” he said.

Photograph: Gcis Handout/EPA Putin and Zelenskiy had agreed to receive the mission in their respective capitals Moscow and Kyiv, a South African Presidency statement said. The peace plan is also backed by leaders of Senegal, Uganda, Egypt, the Republic of the Congo, and Zambia. Ramaphosa said the US and Britain had expressed “cautious” support for the plan and the UN secretary general had also been briefed about the initiative. In recent days South Africa has become embroiled in a row about whether it had allowed a Russian arms shipment to depart from Cape Town, which South Africa denies. Updated at 2.05pm BST 1.32pm BST Andriy Yermak, part of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, has publicly criticised the normalisation of some relations between Russia and Georgia. He posted to Telegram to say: Georgia allowed one more airline to operate direct flights to Russia. The Georgian people constantly demonstrate solidarity with Ukraine. We have a common enemy that has been killing Georgians since the 90s and then in 2008, and since 2014 it has been killing Ukrainians. For our peoples, this enemy is existential. But some seem to be trying to ignore the rocket attacks on Kyiv, the destroyed Marinka, the people killed in Buch, Irpen, Izium, the abduction of children … Some seem to have forgotten the tragedy in Gori. Perhaps it seems to some that it does not concern them. And interaction with terrorists and murderers is normal. Wrong position, history will put everything in its place, people will definitely do it too. 1.28pm BST France has issued a diplomatic communiqué about the overnight attack on Kyiv, describing the targeting of civilians as “war crimes” which “cannot go unpunished”. It says: France condemns in the strongest terms the high-intensity missile and drone strikes that once again targeted the Ukrainian capital last night. These strikes have once again deliberately targeted civilian targets, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, and demonstrate Russia’s determination to continue to escalate its war of aggression against Ukraine. As the Minister for Europe and foreign affairs, Catherine Colonna, has repeatedly pointed out, these unacceptable acts constitute war crimes and cannot go unpunished. France will continue to provide support to the Ukrainian courts and to the international criminal court in order to fight against impunity for such crimes. As recalled again by the President of the Republic last night, France will continue to help Ukraine to resist this illegal aggression, both militarily and humanitarianly. 12.55pm BST The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has decided to hand over the historic 15th-century Trinity icon from a museum to the Russian Orthodox church because of its importance to believers, the Kremlin’s spokesperson has said. The church, whose conservatism Putin has espoused as part of his vision for Russia’s national identity, is one of the most ardent institutional supporters of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Its head, Patriarch Kirill, has urged Russians to rally behind Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine and said last year that those who died fighting in Ukraine would be purged of their sins. Icons are stylised, often gilded religious paintings considered sacred in Eastern Orthodox churches. Andrei Rublev’s Trinity, one of the holiest and most artistically important Russian icons, is thought to have been painted to honour Saint Sergius of Radonezh in Sergiyev Posad, near Moscow. It depicts three angels who visited Abraham at the Oak of Mamre in the Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible. The icon has been transferred several times during periods of internal strife. In 2022, the work was moved for religious celebrations back to a monastery in Sergiyev Posad: the Trinity Lavra of St Sergius, spiritual centre of the Russian church and a Unesco world heritage site. The Moscow Patriarchate said in a statement that it would be displayed for a year at the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in central Moscow before returning to Sergiyev Posad. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: “This concerns a large number of believers in our country, for whom this is a very sacred object. For these, our believers, of course, hiding it in a museum doesn’t fulfil their desire.” Updated at 1.08pm BST 12.46pm BST Russia has said it is still undecided on the extension of a landmark Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine, brokered by the UN and Turkey and due to expire 18 May. “There are a lot of unanswered questions regarding our part of the deal … now we have to make a decision,” the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). The conflict between Russia and Ukraine – both major grain exporters – triggered fears of a global food crisis when major Ukrainian ports were blocked by Moscow’s warships. In July 2022, the agreement allowing Ukrainian grain exports to restart was signed, as well as a parallel memorandum on unhindered Russian food and fertiliser exports. Russia has however repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the deal, claiming that obstacles remain to its own food exports. During recent talks in Istanbul, the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said: “We are heading toward an agreement on the extension of the grain deal.” Russia has laid out a list of conditions for it to agree to an extension, including allowing the Russian Agricultural Bank (Rosselkhozbank) to reconnect to the Swift payment system. Supplies of agricultural machinery, spare parts and services also have to be resumed, and obstacles to granting Russian vessels insurance and access to foreign ports must be lifted, it says. Moscow’s conditions also include the resumption of ammonia exports for fertilisers through a major pipeline that goes through Ukraine.

Oleh Syniehubov and Pavlo Kyrylenko confirmed the figures on Tuesday. A man and a woman were killed in shelling in the village of Dvorichna in Kharkiv, with another man taken to hospital because of his injuries. Meanwhile in Donetsk four were killed by Russian attacks in Avdiivka. Another three were injured in Chasiv Yar, a town about 15km to the west of Bakhmut. 11.33am BST The Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska’s diplomatic world tour continued as she met the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, in Seoul on Tuesday. Zelenska said she was seeking “more radical” backing for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. South Korea, the world’s ninth-largest arms exporter, has sent humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and has also sold tanks and howitzers to Poland. However, it has a longstanding policy of not providing weapons to active conflict zones. In her interview with Yonhap, Zelenska also responded favourably when asked if Ukraine planned to invite Yoon to Kyiv. She said Ukraine was “always waiting for its friends”. Updated at 12.43pm BST 11.15am BST Head of Ukraine&apos;s supreme court arrested over bribery claims The head of Ukraine’s supreme court has been detained over an alleged bribery scheme, according to a prosecutor from the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office. The prosecutor did not name the official detained but told reporters, including from Reuters, he was the head of the supreme court and had not yet been served with a formal “notice of suspicion”. The supreme court is headed by Chief Justice Vsevolod Kniaziev, who could not be reached for comment Updated at 11.16am BST 11.02am BST Russia claims it has destroyed Patriot air defence system Russia’s defence ministry has said it has destroyed a US-built Patriot surface-to-air missile defence system overnight with a hypersonic Kinzhal missile attack on Ukraine, the Zvezda military news outlet reports. It quoted the ministry as saying the overnight strikes had also been aimed at Ukrainian fighting units and ammunition storage sites, Reuters reported. Ukraine said earlier that it had shot down 18 Russian missiles overnight, including an entire volley of six Kinzhals. Updated at 11.29am BST 10.46am BST China’s special Ukraine envoy, Li Hui, will visit Warsaw on Friday after his two-day trip to Kyiv, Poland’s ministry of foreign affairs said on Tuesday. “That will be the case,” Łukasz Jasina, a spokesperson for the ministry, told AFP, confirming earlier reports in Polish media and adding that the envoy would meet a Polish deputy foreign minister in Warsaw. Beijing had announced Li’s visit last week, saying that apart from Ukraine and Poland he would also visit Russia, France and Germany. China said the aim of the tour was to “communicate with all parties on the political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis”. China, which has close ties with Russia, has tried to position itself as a mediator in the war in Ukraine. Updated at 10.54am BST 10.39am BST Luke Harding has visited Kyiv’s zoo in the aftermath of the rocket strikes. Kyiv zoo director Kirill Trantin shows damage shown to foliage in from debris of an overnight missile attack Photograph: Luke Harding/The Guardian A Russian rocket from last night’s missile attack on Kyiv fell on the city’s zoo, slicing through trees and landing next to enclosures containing vultures and a family of racoons. Ukraine’s air defences shot down the missile, together with 17 others. The zoo’s director, Kirill Trantin, was in a shelter a few hundred metres away, with about 20 other employees, as the “exceptionally intense” attack unfolded. “It was 2.50am. It was very loud and very bright. We heard a boom. There was no fire and fortunately no humans or animals were hurt,” he told the Guardian. “Police arrived and took away a part of the missile, which was shot down.” Asked what type, he replied: “That’s secret”. Trantin said the debris had already been swept up, with the zoo opening to visitors as usual at 10am. The animals did not appear distressed but would be monitored over the coming days and if necessary given anti-depressants in their water, he said. In the meantime they would get extra apples and nuts. He added: “The Russians are not humans. They want to punish and scare us. They don’t give a shit about international law or norms. But we’ve held on for more than a year already and won’t give in. Ten of my zoo colleagues are fighting with the Ukrainian army, including three in Bakhmut.” The zoo is a popular Kyiv attraction. One mother, Maryna, said she had taken her 11-year-old son Serhii to see the chimpanzees as a birthday treat. “He’s 11 today. Last night’s attack was terrible. But I promised to take him to the zoo and a promise is a promise.” Updated at 10.53am BST 10.30am BST Ukrainian counter-offensives are continuing around Bakhmut, according to the commander of the ground forces of Ukraine’s army. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi visited troops and officers in the city on Monday. He posted on Telegram on Tuesday morning: “Wagner fighters got into Bakhmut like rats into a mousetrap. Using the principle of active defense, we resort to counteroffensive operations in some directions near Bakhmut. The enemy has more resources, but we are destroying their plans.” He said that further plans and precautions were discussed during the meeting. Syrskyi also commended a number of brigades for their efforts during the conflict. Updated at 10.51am BST 10.12am BST The wife of the German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder has been sacked from her role as a trade representative for a German state-owned business agency over her attendance at a Victory Day reception at the Russian embassy in Berlin. Employment relations between Soyeon Schröder-Kim and NRW.Global Business have been terminated “without notice and with immediate effect”, a spokesperson for the economic ministry in the western German state of North-Rhine Westphalia said on Tuesday. Leaked photographs revealed Schröder and his spouse were at a reception at the Russian embassy in Berlin on 9 May, drawing further criticism for the disgraced former Social Democrat head of government, who has refused to deny his friendship with Vladimir Putin and business ties to Russia in spite of the Kremlin’s attack on Ukraine. Schröder-Kim, 55, has been employed as a representative for South Korea at the foreign trade promotion agency of North-Rhine Westphalia for eleven years, a role that she still listed as her primary employment on her LinkedIn profile on Tuesday. Updated at 10.24am BST 9.45am BST Earlier today the Sky News security and defence editor Deborah Haynes spoke to viewers about the overnight attacks in Kyiv. She said: We know that three people so far have been injured from falling debris. Because even when you shoot these missiles out the sky, of course there are big chunks of metal that come down, and can really damage buildings and of course, kill and injure people. She also spoke of the strategic difference new weapons from the UK could make to Ukraine’s war effort, explaining: [The UK has] sent Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine. These are missiles that are capable of hitting Russian positions deep in Ukrainian territory. Because we know that the Ukrainians have been using their multiple launch rocket systems, which have a smaller range, to hit Russian position. So the Russians are moving their suppliers and people out the way. But these missiles now, that the UK has given, will mean that everywhere in Ukraine is within reach of the Ukrainians. So no Russian tank is safe. 9.31am BST Kim Willsher reports for the Guardian from Paris: Emmanuel Macron has said France is open to training Ukrainian fighter jet pilots in France. In a televised interview on Monday evening, the French president, who dined with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the Elysée on Sunday evening, said the training programmes could start right away, but appeared to rule out sending warplanes to Kyiv. “We have opened the door to training pilots, and this with several other European countries who are also ready (to do so). I think discussions are under way with the Americans,” Macron told TF1 television. “I have not talked about planes. I have talked about missiles, I have talked about training,” he added. France will also help train Ukrainian troops from “the battalions that will be in charge of the counter offensive … and repair vehicles and cannon”, Macron said. “France retains the same position: to help Ukraine to resist. Much is at stake right now because the success of this counter-offensive will be decisive for the ability to build lasting piece”. After the two presidents met, they issued a joint statement saying: “In the coming weeks, France will train and equip several battalions with tens of armoured vehicles and light tanks including AMX-10RC.” 9.16am BST Tatyana Moskalkova, Russia’s commissioner for human rights, has said that she has sent more than 100 appeals to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) so far this year after receiving reports of mistreatment against Russian prisoners in Ukraine. Tass reports she said: “More than 100 appeals this year alone, evidence of violence, violation of the Geneva conventions, humiliation of our prisoners.” Updated at 10.02am BST 9.06am BST Ukraine assessing damage after &apos;exceptional intensity&apos; of overnight attack on Kyiv Luke Harding reports for the Guardian from Kyiv: Ukraine was assessing the damage after Russian forces carried out a massive strike of “exceptional intensity” on Kyiv overnight, in one of the biggest attacks on the capital since last year’s invasion. Emergency sirens woke residents at 2.30am local time and soon afterwards there were loud booms as Ukrainian air defences engaged incoming missiles. Tracer fire lit up the sky and car alarms went off. There were explosions. A further air raid warning sounded at 4am. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Kyiv’s defenders shot down 18 out of 18 Russian rockets and drones. The city had came under an intense and sweeping attack from the “north, south and east”, featuring missiles fired from air, sea and land, he said.

They also downed nine cruise missiles, three ballistic missiles, six kamikaze drones and three unmanned aerial vehicles, Ukraine’s military high command said. After a sleepless night in which many locals sought refuge in bomb shelters, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, gave an update on damage. He said there were three victims in the Solomyan district, which was hit by falling rocket debris. Rescuers extinguished blazes after vehicles caught fire. An explosion is seen in the sky over Kyiv.

According to US officials, speaking to CNN, Moscow has been trying to knock out the Patriots, which arrived in the country a few weeks ago. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government has received at least two Patriot systems, from Washington and Berlin. They have significantly enhanced Ukraine’s air defences before an expected counter-offensive, and allow Kyiv to intercept more modern Russian missiles such as the Kinzhal.

Access to cheap Russian crude has boosted output and profits at Indian refineries, enabling them to export refined products competitively to Europe and take bigger market share. “If diesel or gasoline is entering Europe ... coming from India and being produced with Russian oil, that is certainly a circumvention of sanctions and member states have to take measures,” the bloc’s chief diplomat said. 6.04am BST Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said falling debris from Russian strikes set several cars on fire and damaged a building in the Solomyanskyi district in the capital’s west. Three people were injured. Klitschko said that south of Boryspil, air defence systems were repelling a drone attack. Boryspil, a city just southeast of Kyiv, is home to the capital’s main passenger airport, which is now closed. The damage in other districts was not significant and there was no immediate information on potential casualties there, the military administration said. Air raid sirens blared across nearly all of Ukraine in the early hours of Tuesday, and were heard over Kyiv and its region for more than three hours. 5.52am BST European leaders meet in Iceland European leaders will travel to Iceland on Tuesday for a two-day summit meant to show their support for Ukraine, Reuters reports. In only the fourth summit of the Council of Europe (CoE) since it was founded after the second world war, the 46 members of the leading human rights body, which is entirely separate from the EU, will gather to discuss emerging threats as the war in Ukraine rages on. “The Council of Europe is often underestimated in its importance,” Frank Schwabe, a German lawmaker who was closely involved in the planning of the summit told Reuters. The Council of Europe’s democratic values are upheld by the Strasbourg-based European court of human rights, where citizens can take governments to court in case of human rights violations. Russia’s membership was suspended the day after it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow then left the watchdog hours before a vote to expel it. “The summit will also be about saying what happens if you don’t respect the rules,” Schwabe said. “The threat of expulsion is already a sharp sword. Even Russia didn’t want to leave the Council of Europe, Turkey doesn’t want to leave either.” Updated at 10.27am BST 5.49am BST ‘Exceptionally’ intense air atacks on Kyiv overnight Russia launched an exceptionally intense air attack on Kyiv in the early hours of Tuesday, using drones, cruise and probably ballistic missiles, city officials said, as the Ukrainian capital suffered its eighth air raid this month. “It was exceptional in its density - the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time,” Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s city military administration, said in comments posted on the Telegram messaging app. “According to preliminary information, the vast majority of enemy targets in the airspace of Kyiv were detected and destroyed!” It was not immediately known how many objects were shot down over the city and if any of them managed to hit their target. On Tuesday, falling debris was reported in Kyiv’s Obolonskyi, Shevchenkivskyi, Solomyanskyi and Darnytskyi districts, Reuters said, citing officials. 5.31am BST Summary Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: Russia launched an exceptionally intense air attack on Kyiv in the early hours of Tuesday, using drones, cruise and probably ballistic missiles, city officials said, as the Ukrainian capital suffered its eighth air raid this month. The attack comes as European leaders travel to Iceland today for a two-day summit meant to show their support for Ukraine. Falling debris was reported in Kyiv’s Obolonskyi, Shevchenkivskyi, Solomyanskyi and Darnytskyi districts, officials said. We’ll bring you more on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments: British prime minister Rishi Sunak said Britain would provide Ukraine with hundreds of air defence missiles and further unmanned aerial systems, including new long-range attack drones with a range of more than 200km in the coming months, during a visit by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy’s visit comes off the back of trips to Berlin and Paris. The Ukrainian leader said he was also “very positive” about creating a “jets coalition” in the war against Russia, with a decision on the provision of western fighter jets expected soon. Sunak said the UK was preparing to open a flight school to train Ukrainian pilots and France has also now offered to train Ukrainian fighter pilots, president Emmanuel Macron said in Paris, though he ruled out sending war planes to Kyiv. The US is seeing more indications that Russia and Iran are expanding an unprecedented defence partnership that will help Moscow prolong its war in Ukraine as well as pose a threat to Iran’s neighbours. Iran has reportedly provided Russia with one-way attack drones, including more than 400 since august, US national security adviser John Kirby said at a news briefing. Ukraine hailed its first substantial battlefield advances for six months. Since last week, the Ukrainian military has started to push Russian forces back in and around the embattled city of Bakhmut, its first significant offensive operations since its troops recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November. The World Health Organization’s European office decided to close a specialised WHO office in Moscow and move its functions to Denmark. Calls from members to shut the office came last year over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, inadvertently confirmed that four military aircraft had been shot down over Russia last week near the borders of Ukraine and Belarus, saying the capital city Minsk had responded by putting its armed forces on high alert. Photos also emerged of Lukashenko today visiting an air force installation. The president had not been seen since 9 May, causing speculation about his health. Data published on the Federal Treasury’s online budget portal shows Russia spent 2tn roubles (£21bn) on defence in January and February alone. This is a 282% jump on the same period a year ago, illustrating the spiralling costs for Moscow of its conflict in Ukraine. Russia’s top army general, Gen. Oleg Salyukov, and his South African counterpart, Lt. Gen. Lawrence Mbatha discussed “military cooperation” at a meeting in Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry said. The announcement came hours after South African president Cyril Ramaphosa denied US accusations that his country was siding with Russia in Ukraine and had sent weapons to help it. Seven people including a Russian-installed senior official and a teenager were wounded when an explosion ripped through a beauty salon in the centre of Russian-controlled Luhansk in eastern Ukraine on Monday, officials said. UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said that efforts will continue to extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain, a pact Moscow has threatened to quit on 18 May over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports, Reuters reports. Zelenskiy issued a new appeal to Nato to make a “positive political decision” on Kyiv’s membership at its July summit. Zelenskiy made his remarks in a video address to the Copenhagen democracy summit. He said that Finland joining Nato showed the strength of security guarantees, and thanked Denmark and other allies for their resolve in assisting Ukraine against Russia. 4.05am BST We’re going to pause the blog here but will be back to bring you any breaking news as it happens. 4.02am BST Tonight’s attack on Kyiv was the eighth since the beginning of May and it was “exceptional in its density,” the head of the city’s military administration, Serhii Popko, has said in a post on Telegram. “This time, the enemy launched a complex attack from different directions simultaneously, using UAVs, cruise missiles and probably ballistic missiles. It was exceptional in its density – the maximum number of attacking missiles in the shortest period of time,” he said. The “vast majority” of missiles and rockets aimed at Kyiv had been destroyed, he said, adding that more information about the number and type of missiles used in the attack would be available soon. Rockets debris had fallen in the Solomyansky, Shevchenkivskyi, Svyatoshynskyi, Obolonskyi and Darnytskyi districts, with the most damage recorded in Solomyansk, where there was a fire in a non-residential building. Damage elsewhere was mostly “not significant”, he said, with most rocket debris falling on parked cars, or parks. There was currently no information about injuries or deaths, he said. Updated at 4.04am BST 3.52am BST Kyiv authorities give all-clear Kyiv’s military administration has once again given the all-clear, after a night in which Russia launched a series of strikes on the Ukrainian capital. 3.47am BST The Institute for the Study of War has been looking into a Washington Post report based on US intelligence which said that Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin offered to reveal Russian positions in exchange for a Ukrainian withdrawal from the devastated city of Bakhmut back in January. The thinktank says that an attempt to cooperate with Ukrainian intelligence would have been part of his feud with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) rather than an attack on president Vladimir Putin. ISW assessed on March 12 that Prigozhin is competing with the Russian MoD for Putin’s favor but had unintentionally alarmed Putin with his military-political ambitions. Prigozhin’s reported outreach to Ukranian intelligence would likely have been part of an effort to win Putin’s favor, in fact, by facilitating a rapid Wagner victory in Bakhmut while harming Russian conventional forces behind the scenes. Prigozhin recently retracted his May 9 comments that indirectly mocked Putin, further indicating that Prigozhin is aware of his dependence on Putin and does not mean to antagonize him. Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin makes a statement in front of Wagner fighters in an undisclosed location earlier this month. Photograph: Press Service Of &quot;concord&quot;/Reuters 3.23am BST There are no encouraging prospects for extending the Black Sea grain export initiative at the moment, a source familiar with the negotiations told the Russian RIA state news agency in remarks published early on Tuesday. Reuters reports: UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Monday efforts will continue in coming days to extend a deal allowing for the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain, a pact Russia has threatened to quit on 18 May over obstacles to its grain and fertilizer exports. “Technical-level” discussions will continue, the unidentified source told RIA, but when asked about the prospects for extending the grain deal, the source said that “at the moment there are no encouraging prospects”. “It’s hard for me to say what will happen tomorrow. Perhaps progress will be made, but if we are talking about today, there are no (prospects),” RIA cited the source as saying. “But we all want and are determined to ensure that the work of the mechanism does not stop.” The United Nations and Turkey brokered the Black Sea grain deal in July last year to help tackle a global food crisis that has been aggravated by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, one of the world’s leading grain exporters. At the same time, the United Nations agreed to help Moscow facilitate its own agricultural shipments. While Russian exports of food and fertilizer are not subject to Western sanctions imposed following the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Moscow says restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have amounted to a barrier to shipments. Commercial vessels including vessels which are part of Black Sea grain deal wait to pass the Bosphorus strait off the shores of Yenikapi in Istanbul, Turkey.

Photograph: Dominika Zarzycka/NurPhoto/Shutterstock 2.38am BST More details on damage to the capital from falling debris. Kyiv Mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, says that in the suburb of Darnytskyi, the wreckage of a UAV fell, without catching fire. UAV stands for unmanned aerial vehicle and often refers to the drones that are regularly used to attack Ukraine from Russia. Klitschko goes on to say that air defences are at work outside the capital as well. South of the city of Boryspil, in the Kyiv oblast, “air defense forces are working on UAVs … Stay in shelters!” the mayor wrote on his Telegram channel. Updated at 2.57am BST 2.26am BST Air alert reapplied in Kyiv An air alert has been announced in Kyiv just 20 minutes after the last one ended. “We ask everyone to urgently go to the shelters of civil protection!” the Kyiv City State Administration said. This is the third air alert in Kyiv in the last 12 hours. 2.14am BST There were air alert sirens in the southern cities of Mykolaiv and Kherson as well. Both have now been given the all clear according to local authorities. There are no reports of injuries in either city at the moment. 2.08am BST Officials announce &apos;all clear&apos; in Kyiv The air alert in Kyiv has been turned off and officials have announced the “all clear” for now. The Kyiv City State Administration has asked residents to “keep an eye on reports and return to shelter if the siren sounds again.” Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko continues to warn of rocket debris that has fallen in multiple locations across the city, injuring at least three. 2.03am BST In another update, Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko says three people have been injured in the Solomyan area. 1.59am BST Kyiv’s mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, says rocket debris has fallen in the Solomyan, Shevchenkivskyi and Darnytsia districts and has warned residents to stay in shelters in a series of posts on the Telegram messaging app. He said several cars had caught fire in Solomyan and that a building had been damaged. Rescuers were at the scene, he said. Cars had also been damaged in Darnytsia. In Shevchenkivskyi rocket debris had fallen on the zoo. 1.51am BST Russia attacks Kyiv, series of explosions heard Another Russian attack is underway in Kyiv, with a series of explosions at 3am local time. Ukrainian air defences lit up the night sky. There was tracer fire and car alarms went off across the capital. Several loud booms could be heard. It was unclear if the explosions came from enemy missiles, or from rockets being shot down. 1.49am BST Opening summary Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Air raid sirens have been going off in Ukraine as locals reported multiple explosions across Kyiv. Officials said air defence systems were repelling attacks on the capital and other areas of the country. “Air defence is working on targets,” the head of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app without giving any further details.

Russia’s defence ministry said it scrambled a fighter jet to prevent French and German patrol aircraft from entering its airspace over the Baltic Sea after it detected them flying towards Russia. Russia said the flights were being conducted by a German P-3C patrol aircraft and a French Atlantic-2 maritime patrol jet. Russia’s defence ministry claimed for the first time that it had downed a long-range Storm Shadow missile supplied to Ukraine by Britain, which announced last week that it was providing them. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Monday that Russia viewed Britain’s decision to supply the missiles “extremely negatively”. Ukraine’s state security agency served businessman Dmytro Firtash and top managers of companies he controls with “notices of suspicion” of embezzlement, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said in a statement. The SBU said that, acting with the Economic Security Bureau, it had uncovered the alleged theft of up to $485m between 2016 and 2022 as part of a “large-scale scheme” involving Ukraine’s gas transit system.

    <head>UK ringleaders jailed over scam providing fake passports for criminals</head>
    <body>The ringleaders of a gang that specialised in supplying fake passports to high-level criminals allowing them to evade arrest and identification have been jailed. Anthony Beard, 61, paid individuals for expired passports and applied for renewals using photographs of criminals who paid up to £20,000 to start new lives in Dubai, Portugal and Spain. On Tuesday, he was sentenced to six years and eight months at Reading crown court and jailed after admitting conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and conspiracy to make a false instrument with intent. “This was the golden ticket for the organised crime networks in order that they could evade arrest, evade identification by local law enforcement either internationally or at home in the UK,” said Craig Turner, deputy director of investigations at the National Crime Agency (NCA). The scheme provided falsified passports to individuals including Jamie Acourt, a former suspect in the original Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry and Ireland’s leading crime boss, Christy Kinahan, among others. The agency said “many fugitives” all over the world have been caught after establishing the use of false identities. Beard, from Sydenham, south-east London, approached “vulnerable people” with similar facial features to their clients, according to the NCA. He is believed to have ushered more than 100 fraudulent passport applications through to completion, with several unsuccessful applications made. Beard used his own contact numbers from burner phones, countersigned passport applications and used contacts pretending to be professionals to verify image authenticity. His fingerprints were found on many of the forms, according to the NCA. Another 74 offences linked to applications were taken into consideration. On Tuesday, Christopher Zietek, formerly known as Christopher McCormack, 67, was also jailed for eight years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, conspiracy to make a false instrument with intent and converting criminal property. Alan Thompson, 72, was sentenced to three years for the same offences. Lawyer Craig Rush representing the three men, said Thompson had been forced to retire on medical grounds and years later was so bored that he was driven to crime. Both Thompson and Zietek were found guilty on 17 March after a trial. Deputy circuit judge, Nicholas Ainley, said the passport scheme enabled “very wicked, sophisticated, violent criminals” to escape justice. He said that Zietek was “clearly the organiser”, providing a link to serious criminals, while Beard was “the leg man” and Thompson had a lesser role. Beard and Zietek were caught after a covert surveillance operation started by the NCA in 2017. The investigation codenamed Operation Strey included handwriting experts and voice recognition specialists, and was described by the agency as one of the “most significant” in recent times. The two men were arrested during coordinated raids in October 2021. “We worked across international borders to bring the masterminds to account, and we will continue to protect the UK from criminals who present a threat to our security, people and economy,” said Turner.</body>

    <head>No 10 food summit ‘no more than a PR stunt’ and failed to tackle key issues</head>
    <body>Rishi Sunak’s Downing Street food summit has been described as “empty&quot; by food and farming industry representatives, who rounded on the prime minister for failing to discuss soaring inflation or set out measures to safeguard British food production. The Farm to Fork summit, the first meeting of its kind, brought together farmers, food producers and some of Britain’s largest supermarkets. One representative of a trade body that attended the summit described it as an “empty meeting” with no action on price or inflation discussed. “It was there for the Tories to show they are supporting farmers,” they said. Another attender said the summit elicited a “low-key response” from those present because it “did not touch the fundamental problems of food price inflation”. “If you are not doing something about the cost of living, cost of production, access to labour and affordability of food then you are never going to fix the overall problem,” the attender said. Related: Food for thought: why isn’t the UK government focusing on soaring grocery prices? | Richard Partington The summit had been expected to tackle topics such as food price inflation, fairness within the supply chain and helping farmers to invest in domestic production, but there was no subsequent announcement on those issues. Ministers offered no commitments in response to a call by the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) to stop Britain’s self-sufficiency in food slipping below its current level of 60%. The summit took place against a backdrop of stubbornly high inflation, partly driven by food and drink prices, which rose 19.1% in the year to March, according to official figures. In advance, consumer groups had called on ministers to ask grocery bosses to commit to holding down prices to help squeezed consumers, after an agreement by supermarkets in France to cap prices on key food items and a move by the French government to support food producers. Hours before the meeting, Sunak published an open letter to farmers, promising to put UK farming at the heart of future trade deals and vowing that chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef would not be allowed on to the UK market. Sunak’s pledges were welcomed by the NFU, which had repeatedly asked the prime minister to hold a food summit. The union’s president has previously criticised the government for making farmers “a pawn in trade deals”, including those struck with Australia and New Zealand by Sunak’s predecessor, Liz Truss, during her time as international trade secretary. Tom Bradshaw, the NFU’s deputy president, said the union believed the government had “put food security on a par with energy security” at the summit, which he called “a big step forwards”. He added that farmers had battled to get ministers to “deliver resilience to the food supply chain”, which he hoped would help reverse recent falls in domestic production, as farmers have quit the industry amid soaring costs. However, the government did not immediately answer the NFU’s calls to make the summit an annual event. The meeting, which according to one person present was attended by between 60 and 70 people and lasted all morning, began with a welcome from the prime minister, before participants took part into four separate discussion groups. Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, who attended the summit, believed the meeting represented only “a little step forward” for the food industry. He welcomed the government’s promises regarding future trade deals, but said “there needs to be more attention on how we and the government promote British food”. He said promising to support producers in international trade deals without making plan on how to tackle food inflation “was like taking one corner of a big problem and trying to fix it without reference to the rest”. Lee Stiles, the secretary of the Lea Valley Growers’ Association, a trade body for glasshouse growers, described the food summit as “no more than a PR stunt” with “nothing of substance” to help growers. Stiles, who was not at the meeting, called on the government to take action to help with labour shortages. He described the current seasonal agricultural workers scheme as “not fit for purpose” because it only enables holders to work for six months, although workers are needed for almost twice that period, meaning that multiple groups had to be trained each year to keep production flowing. Stiles added: “The idea you can fill these roles with local workers is ridiculous and has been since the 1950s.”</body>

    <head>Ministers looking at body-worn facial recognition technology for police</head>
    <body>Ministers are calling for facial recognition technology to be “embedded” in everyday policing, including potentially linking it to the body-worn cameras officers use as they patrol streets. Until now, police use of live facial recognition in England and Wales has been limited to special operations such as football matches or the coronation. Prof Fraser Sampson, the biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner, said the potential expansion was “very significant” and that “the Orwellian concerns of people, the ability of the state to watch every move, is very real”. The government’s intentions were revealed in a document produced for the surveillance camera commissioner, discussing changes to the oversight of technology and surveillance. It said: “This issue is made more pressing given the policing minister [Chris Philp] expressed his desire to embed facial recognition technology in policing and is considering what more the government can do to support the police on this. Such embedding is extremely likely to include exploring integration of this technology with police body-worn video.” Sampson confirmed its accuracy as did a Home Office spokesperson, with the document summarising a government-organised meeting held last month to discuss the technology. Body-worn video was brought in to capture evidence, and interactions between officers and the public. The small cameras can currently capture video in high definition and it is technically possible to link them to live facial recognition (LFR), a system that matches the biometrics of people’s faces against those held on a watchlist. Sampson said: “A camera on an officer walking down the street could check the faces against a watchlist of suspects. They could check hundreds if not thousands of people while on duty. “The technology will be capable of doing many things, not all of which the public would want. In China the algorithm can pick up ethnicity. “It will be able to estimate age; some manufacturers claim it can estimate someone’s mood or state of anxiety.” Sampson said the rules for LFR until now were not devised by parliament, but interpreted in a hurry after authorities including the police lost court cases over the use of the technology. He said: “If the use is unconstrained then no one is in any position to give guarantees about what comparisons LFR is making, what conclusions it is drawing and what the consequences are for you. Policing is based on consent and trust and confidence is vital to policing.” He added: “The Orwellian concerns of people, the ability of the state to watch every move, is very real and that needs to be addressed in any future regulatory framework about the state’s use of this technology.” A Home Office spokesperson said the government backed greater use of facial recognition. “The government is committed to empower the police to use new technologies like facial recognition in a fair and proportionate way. Facial recognition plays a crucial role in helping the police tackle serious offences including murder, knife crime, rape, child sexual exploitation and terrorism.” Emmanuelle Andrews of Liberty, which opposes any use of LFR, said: “If the government is intent on rolling out Big Brother-style facial recognition technology, subjecting more and more people to this invasive practice, it infringes the right to go about our lives without being surveilled and monitored by the police.” Police believe live facial recognition could be the next big leap in fighting crime, essentially industrialising the spotting of wanted people. Lindsey Chiswick, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for facial recognition, said: “As the exploitation of technology and data increasingly benefits society, it is right that policing also considers how new technology can help to prevent crime in an effective, well-governed and proportionate way. “With transparency, accountability and appropriate standards, we believe the use of emerging technology can help policing tackle crime and ultimately keep communities safe.” The Met used LFR at the coronation resulting in one arrest from 68,000 faces scanned, figures show. Three sites were set up, with LFR cameras close to the Savoy and Bridge Street in Westminster, which scanned nearly 38,000 faces and produced no alerts against a list of 10,451 people police regarded as suspects. An LFR camera set up in Piccadilly scanned 30,633 faces, produced two alerts, one of which led to an arrest and one of which led to no further action. The Met data claims there were no false alerts. The Met did not say what the arrest was for. The academic expert Pete Fussey questioned the amount of human and technical resources required for the one arrest, and the scale of human rights infringement involved: “These statistics raise legitimate questions over the proportionality of such tactics given the established legal principle that the human rights of all those whose faces are scanned are engaged, whether they are wanted by the police or not.” The Home Office says a new bill that would abolish the role of the surveillance camera commissioner simplifies “the oversight of police use of biometrics and surveillance cameras”, making it easier for “police and public” to understand. Others say it would lead to less oversight just as the dangers of the technology become greater with its widespread use. Sampson disagreed with the government: “There is a difference between simplification and abolition.”</body>

    <head>Manchester City machine faces decisive moment on road to history</head>
    <body>Even by the standards of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, it was a stunning display of strength. There were a few of them here at the club’s training ground on Tuesday as the manager looked ahead to the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid on Wednesday night – one of the most monumental occasions in City’s history. As he had done before the first leg at the Bernabéu last Tuesday, which finished 1-1, Guardiola had no problem in admitting his bosses – the top brass from Abu Dhabi – craved a first Champions League success. It has been a subtle change of tone and his articulation of it seems to come from a place of confidence. Pre-match tension? You did not feel it in Guardiola, despite a bit of his usual fidgeting. He was a snapshot in easy cool, self-awareness, too. “I’m not overthinking it, don’t worry guys,” he said with a smile. Related: ‘I’m not overthinking’: Guardiola gears up for City’s duel with Real Madrid Guardiola wants his team to play what is in front of them, to be themselves, not to fret about what has happened in the past, the agonising knockout-phase losses. Hence the line about his legacy being “exceptional already”. Guardiola blew out his cheeks. “At home, we feel … wow,” he said. “Full of belief.” But if we needed action to go with the words, then the guy who occupied the press conference stage before him had a story to tell; an illuminating one. Kyle Walker was trucking along nicely until the home win against Newcastle on 4 March, after which he went out and about in town and everything unravelled. Walker’s shame has been well documented; the story about the CCTV footage that appeared to show him exposing himself in a bar, the subsequent out-of-court disposal – the way police resolve a low-level crime where the offender is known and has admitted to the offence. Guardiola cold-shouldered Walker until the middle of April, starting him once in six games – the FA Cup tie against Burnley. He left him as an unused substitute in the biggest matches during the run – the Champions League last‑16 second leg against RB Leipzig, the league match with Liverpool and the quarter-final first leg against Bayern Munich. Pep Guardiola has backed his Manchester City side to continue their impressive home form against Real Madrid. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Was Guardiola punishing Walker for his off-field behaviour? He has not said. But what he did say on 8 April might have been more wounding. Guardiola had preferred to play a centre-half out of position over Walker at right‑back, mainly John Stones, asking him to step up and across into midfield. He explained that it was because Walker lacked the tactical intelligence to do so, the “educated movements”. Ouch. Guardiola had already moved on one full-back – João Cancelo to Bayern in January – albeit he tended to use him on the left. Now he discarded undisputedly England’s No 1 right-back, whom he had counted on for years. Does any other club manager in Europe have the range of options to act like this? Or the chutzpah? It looked over for Walker at City. The team, though, did not miss a beat. They continued to win. This is the machine into which Madrid have run, the one eyeing more than Champions League glory. City are on for the treble and it has come to feel as if everybody expects them to complete it. They are normalising the ridiculous. Related: Gündogan double eases Manchester City towards title with win at Everton Even better for Guardiola has been Walker’s form after regaining his place. He has barely missed a beat and was exceptional – to borrow his manager’s description – in the first leg against Madrid; against the danger man, Vinícius Júnior. It is the duel that could shape the return. Everyone seemingly has emerged from the episode in better shape: Guardiola, Walker, City as a collective. They are ready for the defining moments. “Sometimes, certain opinions in football … you don’t always agree with,” Walker said. “Did it hurt? Of course it did. I can’t sit here and lie to you and say it didn’t hurt. You start to doubt yourself but you have to go back to basics … to prove him wrong and that is what I have done.” Walker v Vinícius has been built up in a similar way to Walker v Kylian Mbappé before the World Cup quarter-final between England and France last December. England lost but Walker conceded nothing in the duel. At the age of 32, he has lost none of his pace and he revealed he had been clocked “the other day by one of the lads in sports science” at 37.5km/h. ‘Boxers fight and then they shake hands’: Kyle Walker and Vinícius Júnior after the first leg. Photograph: Alfaqui/Abaca/Shutterstock Guardiola feels his team must be better than they were in the first leg; they need to be more creative, get balls into Erling Haaland, show greater cohesion. But he will demand more of the same from Walker, whose embrace with Vinícius after the game was one of the abiding images. “I went to hug him because he tried to rainbow flick me, so it was kind of like: ‘Please don’t try that again – I don’t want to be a meme,’” Walker said. “Boxers fight and then they shake hands after. That is the level of respect I have for him. I will give him the respect [after the final whistle] but before then it is dog eat dog.” Walker talked about how City had grown from the Champions League exits of the past, mentioning the heartbreaker against Tottenham in 2019. He also said that the team had walked a fine line in the league this season; one more bad result after the draw at Nottingham Forest on 18 February and it “could have been all over”. Instead, they have won 11 games in a row, a fifth title in six years now a formality. “We seem to kick on at the business end,” Walker said. “We were having a joke with Ilkay Gündogan yesterday – he turns into prime Zidane in the last couple of months. These players are born winners.” They just have to show it against Madrid.</body>

    <head>Dominic Kwiatkowski obituary</head>
    <body>Malaria kills more than half a million people every year, mostly children under the age of five in Africa. Saving the lives of those children was the lifelong mission of Dominic Kwiatkowski, who has died suddenly aged 69. Allied to that ambition was his vision that genetic sequencing – a technology that was beginning to be affordable on a large scale in the 2000s – could answer questions about why some children died and others survived. A professor at Oxford University, Dominic recognised that bringing the power of genomics to bear on malaria would need data from multiple studies in many countries. He saw that the only way to achieve that was in partnership with researchers based in the countries where malaria was endemic. Persuading western funders to invest in diseases that mainly affect developing countries is never easy, but in 2005 Dominic won funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust to set up the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN). Over time, research funding that had originally been funnelled via wealthy institutions in the north has increasingly gone directly to researchers in malaria-endemic countries. MalariaGEN is now a global community, with more than 200 researchers in more than 40 countries. From the outset it embodied principles of openness and data sharing, with Dominic often travelling to partner institutions to establish mutual trust. Together with training and the development of laboratories, this helped to ensure that the researchers gained the capacity to lead their own studies and dispelled any suspicion that rich countries were exploiting the resources of less-wealthy ones. Abdoulaye Djimdé, professor of parasitology in Bamako, Mali, who was a founder olf the Plasmodium Diversity Network Africa, has credited Dominic with training his generation of scientists and pioneering the principle of sharing data, samples and results. According to Olivo Miotto, of the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand, “Dominic was passionate about giving researchers in endemic countries the same opportunities as researchers in the UK or other rich countries.” Miotto and his Thai colleagues deployed methods developed by international partners to extract the DNA of the parasite that causes malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, directly from very small blood samples taken from infected children. The technique has transformed surveillance to detect the emergence of drug-resistant parasites. MalariaGEN now has the world’s largest dataset on malaria, combining the genomics of human populations, the parasite, and the mosquitoes that spread it. This resource is vital to the development of new and better vaccines and ultimately to eliminating the disease. Jeremy Farrar, former director of the Wellcome Trust and now chief scientist at the World Health Organization, said: “Dominic was always ahead of his time in arguing that one should consider the host and parasite together. What [the partnership] did on the human side and latterly with artemisinin resistance on the parasite side was groundbreaking work.” Born in Hammersmith, west London, Dominic was one of four children of Mary (nee Hernon), a nurse, midwife and health visitor, and Karol Kwiatkowski, an engineer. He grew up first in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, attending Preston Catholic college, and later in the village of Minchinhampton in Gloucestershire, where he went to Marling school, a boys’ grammar in Stroud. He won a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, to study philosophy, physiology and psychology, and subsequently trained as a doctor. He completed his medical training at Guy’s hospital in London, specialising in paediatrics. In 1986 he went to the Gambia to work with Brian Greenwood, the director of the Medical Research Council Laboratories there, initiating studies of genetic variants that might affect susceptibility to malaria. Witnessing the terrible impact of the disease on young children was life-changing. In 1989 he took up a post in the Oxford University department of paediatrics, continuing his clinical research in west Africa and subsequently basing his research group in the city’s Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics and Big Data Institute. In 2006, the year after he founded MalariaGEN, Dominic took up a joint appointment at the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, which had the best resources in the country for high-throughput genome sequencing. By 2020, the year he retired from his Oxford chair, his group had built up an unrivalled reputation in the genomic surveillance of disease and understanding the structure of host populations. Far from ready to give up work, Dominic moved with all his team to the Sanger. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, he was a key player in the establishment of the Covid-19 Genomics Consortium UK (COG-UK) in March 2020, many of his own team pivoting to sequence thousands of virus samples. The Sanger Institute’s Genomic Surveillance Unit, established in 2021, continues to support data-sharing initiatives globally in malaria, Covid and other infectious diseases – realising a vision Dominic had put forward a decade before. “After Covid, people understood that genomic surveillance was a powerful tool for public health,” said Dominic’s longstanding colleague Vikki Simpson, now head of partnerships and engagement at the unit. Outside his field Dominic had virtually no public profile – he never sought the limelight and even when elected to the Royal Society, a distinction he valued, he refused to allow his colleagues to throw a party to celebrate. But it would be wrong to call him self-effacing. In making a case to potential funders, or debating a point of research strategy, his passion would command the room. He worked obsessively: in the little time he left for recreation, he enjoyed music, poetry, family walks, running and cycling. Dominic retired from his faculty position at the Sanger in 2022. He had been looking forward to spending more time supporting colleagues around the world in their malaria surveillance efforts, and was working on a revised model of population genetics when he collapsed suddenly at home. In 1980 Dominic married Janice Giffen, a development economist. She and their four children, Joe, Tom, Rachel and Dan, survive him, as do three grandchildren, Joan, Nahla and Layla. • Dominic Peter Kwiatkowski, paediatrician and geneticist, born 25 May 1953; died 27 April 2023</body>

    <head>Why are terms linked to antisemitism being used at UK conservatism event?</head>
    <body>A conference run by a rightwing US thinktank might be expected to feature robust discourse on culture wars and identity. But the National Conservatism gathering has gone notably further: with speeches using terms linked to antisemitism and the far right. The debate over “cultural Marxists” and “globalists”, as used by onstage speakers, including a Conservative MP, at the gathering in Westminster, is a microcosm of the wider jostling about the populist right and language. On the one side, self-styled free speech defenders insist any worries are confected, an attempt to stifle debate and to unfairly link conservatives with an entirely separate extreme fringe. But others – including many Jewish groups – worry deeply about what they see as the importation of tropes linked with far-right conspiracy theories and thus, very often, antisemitism, whether done out of malice or carelessness. Cultural Marxism, used as a term of abuse in a speech on Monday by the Conservative MP Miriam Cates, is the more straightforward of the two ideas to pin down. It has its origins in a conspiracy theory that Marxist scholars of the Frankfurt school in interwar Germany, many of whom were Jewish, devised a programme of progressive politics intended to undermine western democracies. At the centre of the idea, says Dr Huw Davies, a sociologist at Edinburgh University, is the belief that socialists aim to spread their credo by first taking over cultural and educational institutions, an idea often tied to an apparently invented quote from the Italian Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci. Some on the right, Davies said, “think they’ve got political power, but they don’t think they have cultural power. So they are looking for an explanation for why that happened.” While there is little debate that the idea of cultural Marxism has antisemitic overtones and is closely linked to the far right, it is not uncommon for British politicians to use it. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, who also spoke at the National Conservatism event on Monday, was criticised by Jewish groups for doing so in 2019. The following year, 26 Tory MPs wrote a joint letter to the Daily Telegraph accusing the National Trust of being beset by “cultural Marxist dogma”. Davies said: “They think it sort of gives them a sort of intellectual veneer of credibility, as if it’s established theory in academia or something. But it’s only because they’ve been listening to rightwing academics who believe it’s a valid theory. “It should horrify them that it is in the manifestos of racist mass murderers like Anders Breivik. It’s often accompanied by the language of disgust and disease, metaphors like it has ‘infected’ our schools and universities. It implies that these institutions need to be restored to purity, need to be cleansed.” Not all agree, however. Yoram Hazony, the Israeli-US writer whose thinktank runs the conference, condemned what he called “this attempt to smear a friend of the Jews, such as Miriam Cates, with the utterly preposterous accusation of antisemitism”. He argued: “The term cultural Marxism is as an apt phrase to describe the cultural agenda promoted by many on the left today. The Edmund Burke Foundation offers no platform to antisemites. We are proud to number Miriam Cates among our speakers and friends.” “Globalist” is an arguably more ambiguous term, although experts and Jewish groups say its use as part of the notion that left-leaning institutions and banks are seeking to take over the world is often connected to antisemitic conspiracy theories, especially when tied to people such as the Jewish financier George Soros. The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who arguably pioneered the use of much of the populist-nationalist language now being employed by some Conservatives, has been criticised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, among others, for using Soros as a central trope in theories about globalists. At the National Conservatism conference on Tuesday, Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a US thinktank, mentioned the globalist idea more than a dozen times, tying it into the notion that leftwing groups want to end democracy and impose their views. “The new left, greedy, elitist, woke and globalist, has foresworn every principle their ideological predecessors once espoused: democracy, equality, diversity, justice,” he said. The trope is a populist repurposing of leftwing criticism about economic globalisation and the increased power of corporations, says Davies, with the addition of conspiracy theories linking it to everything from Soros to the World Economic Forum and the United Nations. The defence that it is a term that UK politicians or people such as Roberts could use innocently is not convincing, says Davies. “This is not hidden knowledge. I don’t understand why you wouldn’t be aware of it. “And whether he is deliberately weaponising it, not following the full connotations, or using it naively, I’m not sure that matters to be honest, because the message is received by the right people.”</body>

    <head>Malcolm Lochhead obituary</head>
    <body>My husband, Malcolm Lochhead, who has died aged 74, was a university design lecturer and a much sought-after embroiderer, textile artist and designer whose work adorns many churches across Scotland. His creations can be seen at Glasgow Cathedral (the shrine of Saint Mungo and the Nurses’ Chapel); the offices of the moderator of the General Assembly; the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle and the Chapel of St Hild at Durham Cathedral, among many other places. He also designed pulpit and lectern falls for churches, and was responsible for most of the furnishings of the Great Hall and the Queen’s Bedchamber at Stirling Castle. Malcolm Lochhead was a lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University from 1975 to 2009 Photograph: provided by family Malcolm was born in Bellshill in North Lanarkshire, the youngest of five children to Walter Lochhead, an accountant, and his wife, Clara (nee Smart). After finishing at Hutcheson’s grammar school in Glasgow, where he was bullied for being gay, he enrolled at the Glasgow School of Art (1966-70) and became the first ever male student to study embroidery and weaving there. He was taught by the well-known Scottish embroiderer Kathleen Whyte, who exerted a great influence on him. Although Malcolm was subsequently offered many tempting career offers, his mother insisted he should get a postgraduate teaching certificate at Jordanhill College of Education (1971) so that he would “always have something to fall back on”. His first teaching post was at Coatbridge high school (1971-75), after which he joined the staff at Queen’s College Glasgow, first as a lecturer in design and then as a senior lecturer in marketing and communication, a post he continued to hold when the college amalgamated with Glasgow Polytechnic and became Glasgow Caledonian University. Altar cloth designed by Malcolm Lochhead for the shrine of St Mungo in Glasgow Cathedral Photograph: from family/Unknown It was during this period that he also became involved in the design, creation and supervision of so many embroidery projects, predominantly in the field of ecclesiastical design. In 1990 he was responsible for the overall design of the Keeping Glasgow in Stitches community arts project, which involved more than 600 amateur participants when Glasgow was European Capital of Culture. Detail from The Wind on the Moon, an embroidered piece by Malcolm Lochhead inspired by the book of that name by Eric Linklater Photograph: from family/Unknown He remained at Glasgow Caledonian University until his retirement in 2009, by which time he was professor of design. Afterwards he was appointed emeritus professor of visual design, continuing to give masterclasses and to supervise masters dissertations. Malcolm also designed small embroidery pieces for private clients for use in their homes, and carried on with his work on larger projects, including designing and supervising the making of a parochet for the synagogue in Giffnock in East Renfrewshire, an altar cloth for York Minster and the creation of the pulpit fall for St Andrew’s College in Christchurch, New Zealand. He exhibited worldwide and had a retrospective at Glasgow Cathedral in 2017. We met in 1975 at a New Year’s Eve party and lived together after that, first as criminals (homosexuality was illegal in Scotland until 1981) and then as civil partners in 2006, before marrying in 2018. Malcolm is survived by me, his sister, Allison, and his nephews and nieces.</body>

    <head>UK will end up like Russia if it ignores European court of human rights obligations, Sunak told – as it happened</head>
    <body>6.03pm BST Early evening summary Rishi Sunak has claimed that the UK is in a good position to persuade the European court of human rights to amend its procedures to make it easier for the UK government to implement its Rwanda policy for refugees. (See 5.21pm.) He was speaking in Iceland, as he arrived for a Council of Europe summit where he will push for changes, particularly to the ECHR’s rule 39 injunction process. But the Icelandic government, which is hosting the summit, has played down the prospect of Sunak getting the agreement he wants at the meeting. (See 3.39pm.) And the president of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly has said the UK could end up like Russia if it just ignores court rulings, as the government wants to give itself the ability to do. (See 5.36pm.) Conservatives need to recognise that elections are won on economics and public services rather than culture wars, Michael Gove has said in what will be seen as a rebuke to Suella Braverman. Media lawyers have described the high court’s decision to permit the naming of a Conservative donor in a global money-laundering case involving a business associate as a boost for open justice. Rishi Sunak has vowed to take chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef off British tables in future trade deals, promising to put UK farming at the heart of government trade policy. Rishi Sunak speaks with the media at the Harpa concert hall in Reykjavík, where a Council of Europe summit is taking place. Photograph: Alastair Grant/PA Updated at 6.25pm BST 5.36pm BST UK will end up like Russia if it ignores ECHR obligations, Council of Europe parliamentary leader tells Sunak Rishi Sunak’s hopes of using this week’s summit in Iceland to pave the way for change to the European court of human rights’ power to block migrant deportation flights from Britain to Rwanda will get a cold reception, a European politician who will meet him there has warned. Tiny Kox, the Dutch senator who is president of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly, told the Guardian that Britain could end up like Russia and face exclusion if it chose to ignore obligations to abide by the Strasbourg-based court. Sunak, who is in Iceland for the first Council of Europe summit in 15 years, is to call for a reform of the ECHR’s rule 39, which was used to issue last-minute injunctions to ground the flights of migrants to Rwanda last year. The government has said it is amending the illegal migration bill, which is currently going through parliament, to include a provision allowing the home secretary to ignore rule 39 injunctions. But Kox told the Guardian: I think the British government knows there is no opt-out of your European court of human rights, which has been signed and ratified decades ago and which has brought a lot of good things to Britain’s judicial system and the protection of its citizens. We are not a cafeteria, where you can ask for the verdict of the court that suits you. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, told a selected group of government-friendly papers during a visit to Rwanda earlier this year that she was “encouraged” by what she said were the UK government’s “constructive” talks with Strasbourg to overhaul court injunctions. But, echoing the views of legal experts in Britain who have cast doubt on the UK’s claims of “possible reforms”, Kox suggested any move by Britain to back away from the treaty that established the court would “harm” British citizens. He said: If London decided to leave the convention, it would be in the same situation as the Russian federation, which we had to exclude from our obligation because of its violations of international law. Updated at 6.04pm BST 5.21pm BST Sunak insists UK well placed to achieve reform of European court of human rights to help &apos;stop the boats&apos; mission Rishi Sunak is in Iceland, where he has given an interview to broadcasters before the Council of Europe summit. The Icelandic government, which is hosting the summit, has played down the prospect of the UK achieving the change to the European court of human rights that it wants at the meeting. (See 3.39pm.) But when Sunak was asked if he was really likely to achieve change, which he says the UK needs so that it can implement its Rwanda policy for asylum seekers, the PM insisted it had persuaded the ECHR to make changes in the past. He said the court itself is reviewing its rule 39 process – the mechanism that was used to halt a flight to Rwanda last year. UK ministers have been talking to the court about this, he said. He went on: When it comes to the European court in particular, it was the UK that led reforms previously, something called the Brighton declaration, which meant that the process was changed previously. We’ll be building on that going forward. So, yes, we have a track record of seeing change happen … One of my priorities for the country is to stop the boats. We’re going to do absolutely everything we can to do that. That’s about working with other countries. That’s why I’m here in Iceland. Rishi Sunak. Photograph: Sky News Updated at 6.07pm BST 5.02pm BST &apos;Not for EU&apos; labels to start appearing on British food products from autumn, Cleverly tells peers “Not for EU” labelling on British food products sold across the UK will be phased in gradually from this autumn, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has told peers. As PA Media reports, Cleverly told a Lords committee that during negotiations with retailers before the signing of the Windsor framework, UK-wide labelling was identified as the preferred option. The labelling requirement is part of the government’s deal with the EU to reduce checks on British products entering Northern Ireland. Cleverly said that while autumn was the starting point for the plan, it would be phased in over a couple of years. He explained: We have been talking about this for quite some time, including in the command paper in 2021, so this shouldn’t really be a surprise to the retail sector. Of course they will want to have details about size and prominence and I will get details about exactly how and when. It is not just a sudden start, we have been talking about this for a couple of years and it won’t be fully implemented for another couple of years. I am not a retailer, I don’t want to imply simplicity when there might be complexity, but this is something we discussed extensively with the retail sector, including those who said that labelling would be a good way of ensuring their products would be available in GB, not just in Northern Ireland.

But the home secretary remains “deeply unpopular with the British public”, according to the polling firm, YouGov. It has sent out this summary of its latest findings. New polling by YouGov reveals that home secretary, Suella Braverman, remains deeply unpopular with the British public as her net favourability score falls to -38, down from -35 at the start of last week. Just 14% of Britons have a favourable view of Braverman, while half (52%) have an unfavourable view, giving her a net score of -38. Among those who voted Conservative in the 2019 general election, her net score is -14. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, also has a negative net favourability score among the general public. Three in 10 Brits (31%) have a favourable view of Sunak, while six in ten (59%) have an unfavourable view of him. This gives the prime minister a net score of -28, virtually unchanged from the -29 he scored last week (5-9 May). The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has a net favourability score of -16 among the public. This is up three points from 5-9 May when he scored -19.

Matthew Hickey, the chief executive of the Gordon Moody Association, which runs residential treatment programmes for adults with the most severe cases of gambling disorder, said his organisation would need to start looking into how it will also start to treat children. He said they are among the “affected-others” harmed by their parents’ and guardians’ gambling addictions, telling the Commons culture committee: That will never be a residential treatment pathway, it will be something during holidays, something during weekends. What’s more important here though, is children as affected-others. A number of our clients will say that they have become an addict because they saw their parent as a gambling addict. It was learned behaviour because dad did it, dad went into the bookies. Or we went into the pub and, from the age of seven, I was allowed to go on the fruit machines in the pub. He added: Yes, we will see a lot of children affected by gaming and younger people gambling, but we’ll see even more as affected-others because of the effects that parents have had on them. He spoke as NHS England published a survey suggesting nearly one in five people gambling online either have a problem or are at risk. The first public survey carried out since start of the Covid pandemic shed light on the proportion of people aged 16 and over who are problem gamblers or engaging in risky gambling behaviour. While a smaller proportion of people in the 16-34 age group had gambled in the past year (excluding lotteries) than people in older age brackets, the young were the most likely to bet online.

He faced a rather hostile room, amid post-Brexit agricultural worker shortages, sky-high input costs, profiteering supermarkets and trade deals undercutting British farmers. However, Minette Batters, the president of the NFU, told the Guardian that she was quite pleased with how the day went, suggesting Sunak had U-turned on his previous policy agenda of prioritising trade deals. She said: I think the prime minister set out a very different agenda on taking domestic food security seriously. We had some very constructive and focused breakout sessions, and on trade he’s happy to take a very tough line with Canada and Mexico. It’s also good to see it in black and white that is not now, or ever, with hormone-treated beef or chlorine-washed chicken. Martin Lines, chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, was at the summit. He said afterwards that although some of what was said about the future was positive, the government still needed to do more to address labour shortages now. He said: They have committed to the same level of seasonal workers for next year, with a possible uplift looking forward, and also investment in automated picking technologies. A lot of what we heard today …. [was] welcome, but there is little actual sorting out the issues within the supply chain and the problems we have with labour today. We need a lot of [workers] to stay for nine months, not six months, and we would like repeat visits by the same people who we train up to be skilled. This is a good first step but we do need to focus on the short-term issues. Minette Batters, the NFU president, talking to journalists in Downing Street today.

In particular, Sunak will argue for reform to the European court of human rights’ rule 39 (see 10.08am), where No 10 says the court is “open” to change (see 1.43pm). But Thordis Gylfadóttir, the Icelandic foreign minister, told Radio 4’s the World at One that the summit, which her government is hosting, would not be focusing much on immigration. She said: This summit has not a big focus on that. The biggest focus is, of course, Ukraine, and then other issues such as AI and environment and other things. So this summit doesn’t have a big focus on migration in general. She also said reform of rule 39 would not be agreed at the summit. She said: The leaders are reconfirming their commitment to the common human rights protection system and in particular, the court is a cornerstone of our protection system. But the next two days, the time we have we are not using to reform certain articles in the court. Pressed on whether there would be discussions on Sunak’s call for changes to rule 39, she said: I believe that there will be a discussion on it, but there will not be I think a real concrete outcome on reforming certain articles.

In answer to a question by from the Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey about the prospects of more talks, Cleverly replied said: “It’s a very simple answer [to] that one overall, which is ‘no’.” Lord Dodds, the former DUP leader in the Commons, expressed anger that the government still had not published the list of EU laws that would apply in Northern Ireland even though they had relied on claims of a vast reduction to “whip up” support for the framework. He asked: Why won’t you give us the list? Is is because you are afraid of the criticism that might be coming forth? Cleverly replied there were “thousands of laws” that disapplied and he was very “proud” of the fact that they got the EU to recognise the starting point was “zero pages” of laws applying in NI. “Far from saying we are embarrassed, the opposite is true,” he said 3.10pm BST Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has told the NatCon conference that he does not think figures out later this month will show net immigration reached 1 million last year. A report last week quoted a thinktank forecast saying the figure could be between 650,000 and 997,000. Asked about the 1 million figure, Gove said: I don’t think it will reach those figures. But you are right, if we are looking at pressure on housing, you need to look at it in the round. So, Britain has always been a country that has benefited from people of talent arriving here and people fleeing persecution. The numbers recently have been at a level where there is an inevitable pressure on housing and on public services. Gove also said a “critical part of Brexit” was being able to “say this is the level of migration we as a country believe is right” and establishing that “there is a limit”.

In a point of order, Butler said she was “deeply troubled” by what Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory former cabinet minister, said yesterday about the government law requiring voters to have photo ID amounting to gerrymandering. She said this implied that ministers misled the country when they described their motives in passing the Elections Act. She went on: It is deeply concerning to see the blatant, could-be politicisation of policy and organisation intended to ensure the fairness and security of our democratic process … The justification for the policy was to combat voter fraud. It seems to me there’s a real possibility that the only fraud could be this government. Butler asked Dame Rosie Winterton, the deputy speaker who was in the chair, if she should report this matter to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, or to the police. In response, Winterton said that if Butler did intend to report this to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, or to the police, she should not be raising it in the chamber. She also said Butler had put her concerns on the record, and that they would have been heard by the government.

The spokesperson said: On rule 39, we believe that the rule 39 system doesn’t currently meet a reasonable standard of natural justice. It’s why we’ve had discussions with Strasbourg and others about reforms to ensure proper transparency and rights to challenge and appeal. We know they are open to that. They’re carrying out their own review on rule 39. It’s a conversation the prime minister will be continuing today. Updated at 3.00pm BST 1.30pm BST Pat Cullen tells RCN conference that, while Steve Barclay is not reopening pay negotiations, he has invited her for talks Steve Barclay, the health secretary, has invited Pat Cullen, the leader of the Royal College of Nursing, to meet him – to talk, but not to negotiate about nurses’ pay. Cullen surprised delegates at the nursing union’s annual conference in Brighton today by revealing that Barclay had contacted her to suggest they meet. Government ministers “might even be watching [our] congress”, Cullen told the 3,000-strong audience. “I’ll tell you why. Who emailed me last night at nine o’clock?” To cheers from delegates, she said: “The health secretary wants to see me.” However, she qualified the terms of the meeting by adding: Colleagues, this is not about negotiations, but it is important that I go and tell him again why many of you voted to reject the pay offer. The RCN and Unite were among four health unions whose members in England rejected a pay deal covering 2022-23 and 2023-24 that eight other unions, and the NHS staff council, accepted. Nurses voted 54%/46% to reject it on a 61% turnout. Barclay has ruled out reopening negotiations about the deal and plans to impose it on members of unions that rejected it. The RCN will next week start balloting members in England for a second time over their willingness to strike, seeking a fresh mandate for a further six months of stoppages. If they get the minimum 50% turnout and 50% approval required under trade union law then the next series of walkouts would affect every NHS trust in England, as opposed to roughly half that were hit by the first stoppages, the union has said.

This is what he said about the left. This new left is not in competition, it is at war with the West, with the moral, intellectual and social foundations on which our entire civilisation rests. Which is why it reserves a singular hatred for the kind of conservatism represented by Donald Trump and [Florida governor] Ron DeSantis, by Brexit, by (Hungarian president) Viktor Orban, and yes by this conference. And this is what he said about the EU. Today the EU embodies the cultural chauvinism, spiritual decadence, strategic incompetence, and tyrannical ambition that have hurried the continent into chaos for millennia. Its systematic assault on member nations’ sovereignty, to say nothing of their diverse cultures, identities and faith, is already tearing Europe apart and pushing it toward the brink. They think because they rule by pen and microphone, they are kinder and gentler than their gauche martinet predecessors who led armies and navies. They’re not. They’re just as imperialistic, ambitious, megalomaniacal and authoritarian as any of the bullies they hope to succeed. The only good news is that they’re weaker than those who failed before them. Updated at 1.37pm BST 1.11pm BST Tories have allowed UK to become home for &apos;dirty money&apos;, SNP claims Alison Thewliss, the SNP MP who tabled the urgent question about Javad Marandi (see 12.48pm), said the BBC legal victory allowing it to name Marandi was “a victory for transparency and freedom of the press, in a battle often weighted in favour of wealthy oligarchs”. She said she was under a duty to say Marandi denied any wrongdoing. His lawyers emailed her just five minutes before the UQ, she said. But she said the National Crime Agency had found that “companies linked to Mr Mirandi played a crucial part in the money-laundering network known as the Azerbaijani Laundromat”. She said it has been reported that $2.9bn has been stolen from the people of Azerbaijan. She went on: The UK must not be a home for the world’s dirty money but has become so under the Tories. Thewliss said she was raising the case because Marandi was linked to companies registered to a mailbox in her Glasgow Central constituency. She said Marandi had donated £756,300 to the Conservative party while the laundromat investigation was going on. That secured access to the Conservative leadership group, she said. She claimed it was “part of a wider effort, no doubt, of reputation laundering”. She asked when Chris Philp, the policing minister, became aware of this case, what action he had taken, and what influence Marandi had secured in return for his donations. In response Philp said that he did not know anything about Marandi until earlier today, when he was briefed on the case. But he confirmed that the government was committed to legislating against so-called Slapps – strategic lawsuits against public participation. And in response to the questions about donations, Philp said he did not know anything about those. But he said it was dangerous for the SNP to raise issues relating to donations given their own funding difficulties at this point. Updated at 1.39pm BST 12.48pm BST In the Commons Chris Philp, the policing minister, has just responded to the SNP urgent question asking for “a statement on the implications of the National Crime Agency’s investigation into Mr Javad Marandi”. The UQ was prompted by a BBC report claiming that Marandi, a major donor to the Conservative party, has companies that were part of a global money laundering investigation. Marandi strongly denies wrongdoing. Philp said the government did not and could not comment on investigations undertaken by law enforcement operations. But he said UK electoral law has “stringent” rules controlling who can donate to political parties. He said donations had to be transparent, and from permissible donors. He said the government had taken “significant steps” to strengthen the integrity of elections in the Elections Act, including strengthening the law in relation to donations. He also said the government was committed to fighting corruption. Updated at 12.53pm BST 12.29pm BST No 10 rejects Nigel Farage&apos;s claim that Brexit has failed At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson also said (unsurprisingly) that Rishi Sunak did not agree with Nigel Farage’s statement about Brexit having been a failure because of “useless” Tory politicians. (See 11.52pm.) The spokesperson went on: The prime minister has talked about the benefits of Breixt on a number of occasion. Just thinking about farming alone [a topic in the briefing, because of the No 10 food summit], we’re talking about some of the benefits that moving away from the bureaucratic cap, which skewed money towards the largest landowners, 50% going to the largest 10%, we now have a fairer system tailored to British farmers post Brexit. And on the issue of being able to use gene-editing technology to mimic the natural breeding process, to help farmers grow more nutritious, more productive crops – those are just two examples in one sector of the benefits the public and UK businesses are enjoying. Asked if Sunak thought Brexit had been a success, the spokesperson replied: “Yes.” He said he had highlighted some of the benefits. But he also said the global economic situation was creating challenges for the British economy.

Asked specifically if the PM agreed with Kruger about a “normative family” being the only basis for a “safe and functioning society”, the spokesperson replied: “No.” Asked if the PM was comfortable about one of his MPs saying something like this, the spokesperson said he had not spoken to Rishi Sunak about this. But he said the government was proud of its record on family policy. (He did not elaborate on what he meant by this, but he may have been referring to policies like equal marriage, which was introduced when the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.)

(Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings would be the other two, but you might also include David Cameron, even though he opposed Brexit, on the grounds that he allowed the referendum to happen.) In his interview, Farage said he did not accept that Britain would have been better off if it had remained in the EU. But he claimed that Brexit had been a failure because the government had failed to take advantage of the potential benefits, and said that policies like higher corporation tax were driving away business. He said: What Brexit has proved, I’m afraid, is that our politicians are about as useless as the commissioners in Brussels.

She said: [Conservatism is] a politics of optimism, pride, national unity, aspiration, and realism. The left’s is a politics of pessimism, guilt, national division, resentment, and utopianism. But, judging by some of the other speeches given to the conference, it is the Tory right who are given to alarmism. In her speech to the conference yesterday the Conservative MP Miriam Cates, claimed that falling birth rates were a threat to “the whole of western society” and that “cultural Marxism … is systematically destroying our children’s souls”. And this morning Sir John Hayes, who chairs the Common Sense group of Tory MPs and who is one of Braverman’s key ideological allies, delivered a speech with even more declinism. Here are some extracts. Hayes claimed the western world faced a “profound crisis” over the ability of nation states to deliver for the people. He said: The western world faces a profound crisis – Although it is often understood as such, in truth this crisis is not just political, economic nor social or even simply a combination of them all. It is a fundamental crisis of efficacy – the ability of the nation state to deliver for its people. He claimed that a split “as chilling as anything envisioned by Marx” had come to pass. He said: At times it is almost as if the reality itself has been bifurcated. That what the establishment envisage and what people actually experience have become two very different things. A dialectic as clear and as chilling as anything envisioned by Marx has come to pass. (I am quoting from the text sent out to journalists. What this actually means is something of a mystery, although Hayes is clearly saying this is a Bad Thing.) He said the Tories have failed to dismantle the constitutional legacy of Blairism. That Conservatives have failed to dismantle the destructive machinery of Blair’s failed constitutional experiment is largely the result of timidity – a failure to do what is truly conservative. UPDATE: PA Media has filed more extracts from the speech that were not included in the text sent out in advance. Hayes said: You know, as I do, that the solution is to be found in conservatism. But not in the desiccated, hollowed-out, sugar-free conservatism deemed to be just about acceptable by our liberal masters. Too many conservatives opt out of conflict, instead seeking the approval of the very establishment which wants to grind them into the dust. No, we must look to a genuine, authentic, time-honoured, true conservatism, free from the lonely individualism and selfish materialism of liberalism.

Updated at 12.17pm BST 10.53am BST Labour dismisses Sunak&apos;s food security summit as &apos;little more than stunt&apos; Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called on the government to halt rocketing food prices, as Rishi Sunak holds a summit with farmers and producers in Downing Street today. Analysis by Labour of the government’s statistical dataset of the average price of wholesale home-grown vegetables shows that British-grown tomatoes now cost 67% more than they did at the same time in 2019. In the 19th week of 2019 the average wholesale price for a kilogram of cherry tomatoes cost £1.79; the latest price in May 2023 stands at £3. The rocketing prices also include a 109% increase for the price of a head of cauliflower, a 95% increase on asparagus, an 82% increase on strawberries and 62% on leeks. Analysis by the Liberal Democrats has also found that even though the wholesale prices on basic products such as bread-making wheat, fruit and veg have tumbled in recent months, prices for consumers in supermarkets have continued to soar. The party has called for the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate the big supermarket chains and multinational food manufacturers, to increase pressure for lower food prices. Analysis by the Lib Dems also revealed that the cost of a typical weekly shop has soared by £604 a year. Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, branded the summit a “stunt” and called for the government to provide an annual report on food security. He told the Guardian: Rishi Sunak’s food summit is little more than a stunt to hide years of inaction from his government. The Tories’ shambolic handling of food security has resulted in huge vegetable price increases across the country. Labour is clear, food security is national security. That’s why we held an emergency food security summit in February and have set out that we will support farmers and domestic food production by ensuring that we buy, make and sell more great British food. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey added: No ifs, no buts, supermarkets must cut these basic prices now. Rishi Sunak needs to grow a spine and stand up for struggling families and pensioners by demanding supermarkets slash prices. They have no excuses, wholesale prices are down, yet food prices are up, with their profits soaring.

Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA 10.08am BST Sunak says current international system for dealing with refugees &apos;not working&apos; ahead of Council of Europe summit Rishi Sunak has said the current international system for dealing with refugees is not working. In a statement issued before his attendance later today at the Council of Europe summit, he said: Every single point on each route used by people traffickers to smuggle people across our continent represents another community struggling to deal with the human cost of this barbaric enterprise. It is very clear that our current international system is not working, and our communities and the world’s most vulnerable people are paying the price. We need to do more to cooperate across borders and across jurisdictions to end illegal migration and stop the boats. I am clear that as an active European nation with a proud history helping those in need, the UK will be at the heart of this. Sunak wants to use the summit to in effect internationalise his “stop the boats” campaigning, seeking agreement on legal changes that would help the government in what it is trying to achieve. In the overnight briefing No 10 does not give much detail as to what he wants to achieve, but it says he will focus on the European court of human rights’s rule 39, that allows it to issue injunctions like the one used last year to stop the first deportations to Rwanda. No 10 says: We need to ensure we have an international legal system which allows sovereign countries to take the domestic steps necessary to help those most in need. That includes reform to the ECHR’s rule 39 process to ensure proper transparency, greater accountability and ensuring decisions can be reconsidered. One potential difficulty is that a government amendment to the illegal migration bill would give ministers the right to ignore rule 39 orders anyway. Some Council of Europe partners may be less keen on changing the rules to help the UK if they think the UK has signalled it does not feel bound by those rules in the first place. Updated at 1.43pm BST 9.48am BST UK schools minister promises to review Sats paper that left pupils ‘in tears’ Nick Gibb, the schools minister, has promised to review a controversial Sats paper, which is said to have left some pupils “in tears”, after teachers and parents expressed widespread concern about the difficulty of the test, Sally Weale reports.

Rishi Sunak is off to Iceland later, where he will be attending a rare meeting of leaders from Council of Europe countries (only the fourth of its kind since the Council of Europe was set up after the second world war) and where he will seek to internationalise his government’s “stop the boats” campaign, pushing for changes to the international legal system that might help countries like the UK. But while Sunak is out of the country, the National Conservatism (NatCon) conference will continue. It is championing a brand of flag, faith and family conservatism that is quite different from the liberal Cameroon conservatism that was dominant in the party at least until Brexit, and quite where Sunak stands on all this is not entirely all clear. (He is a proper social conservative, but he may have qualms about some of the more Trumpian elements of all this, and No 10 strategists do not believe that that oddball culture warmongering is an election winning strategy.) MAIL: Gove’s blast at Starmer bid to ‘rig’ elections #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/Xk3hVCeJxw — Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) May 15, 2023 Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, was once the leading idealogue for Cameroon conservatism, but he is shifted in recent years and this afternoon he is the star turn at the NatCon shindig. Overnight, he has delighted the Daily Mail by launching an attack on the plan being floated by Labour to extend the right to vote to EU nationals and 16- and 17-year-olds. In a letter to Keir Starmer seen by the paper, Gove says: Why do you think it’s right to downgrade the ultimate privilege of British citizenship – the right to vote in a general election? What do you say to those who say that your approach is designed to undermine Brexit – and ‘rig’ the voting system for national elections and referendums? Is it still your view that the ‘age of adulthood in most cases’ is 18, or is this another area where you have changed your approach? Of course, as levelling up secretary Gove played a major role in the introduction of the Elections Act, which arguably restricted “the ultimate privilege of British citizenship” because it said people could not vote without photo ID. Yesterday Jacob Rees-Mogg told the NatCon conference that this amounted to gerrymandering. With luck, Gove will be asked to respond today. In an LBC interview yesterday Keir Starmer stressed that the party has not taken a final decision about extending the franchise, but he explained why he could see the case for extending it to EU nationals who have been living in the UK for a long time, and to 16- and 17-year-olds. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. He is also hosting a Farm to Fork summit on food security at No 10. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Lords protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland committee. 11.45am: Pat Cullen, the Royal College of Nursing general secretary, gives a speech to the RCN conference. 2pm: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, speaks at the National Conservatism conference in London. Afternoon: Sunak attends the Council of Europe summit in Iceland. If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

    <head>Is Martha Stewart’s Sports Illustrated cover a diversity breakthrough? No, it’s just window dressing</head>
    <body>Martha Stewart, at 81, this week becomes the oldest cover star ever to grace Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. With her tousled beach hair, gorgeous pixie face, professional tan and stone swimsuit, well, it would be against my principles to judge whether she looks older or younger than 81, suffice it to say that she looks incredible. She has a silken orange cape draped over her shoulders – a bold choice, I thought, since it recalls the orange-jumpsuit uniform of her prison sentence for lying to federal investigators over a share trade in 2004, but maybe that’s deliberate and ironic. Or maybe I’m the only person who remembers that. “I hope this cover inspires you to challenge yourself to try new things, no matter what stage of life you are in,” she wrote on Instagram. The next-oldest cover star of the magazine was Maye Musk, the insanely good-looking mother of Elon, who appeared in 2022 at the age of 74 and told Hollywood Insider at the time: “Women of all ages, we should walk on the beach and be happy with our bodies.” And all this is great: diversity, inclusion, representation, role modelling, how do we (older women) feel we belong in the world if we don’t see ourselves in the world?, etc. But ladies (and gentlemen, you’re allowed a view, too), do you ever feel as though you’re being played? The very people who invented the unattainable standards of beauty and perpetual youth that have tyrannised women since the advent of magazine cover stars parade their inclusivity and anti-ageism, ventriloquising attitudes of can-do and self-love through the models, and we’re meant to be … what? Grateful? Happier with our bodies? Challenged to try new things? Come on. Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue was conceived in the mid-1960s by the then editor André Laguerre, who wanted to find a way to fill a slow winter month, February, when there was not much sport. Different times, and all that: let’s not waste indignation on the fact that men were lauded by Sports Illustrated for what they could do, while women were prized for what they looked like. Partly by dint of its only annual appearance, the swimsuit issue became a bellwether for the next big thing in modelling, and has made or cemented countless reputations, from Elle Macpherson to Tyra Banks. If this kind of media was, at least until social media took the mantle, the arbiter of female beauty, Sports Illustrated Swimwear Issue was its supreme court, creating the structures of Fordist perfectionism: any shape as long as it’s thin, with a biologically impossible rack. The aesthetic is often skated to the edge of soft-porn with (some) clothes on; a lot of artfully glistening body oil and suggestive poses, in a pretty frank appeal to the predominantly male readership. Since its inception, it has had complaints from the morality police, and post-#MeToo the woke army got involved – and as a card-carrying soldier in that, I can precis our complaint as “Dude, stop photographing us like food.” Related: Karl Lagerfeld had odious views. We shouldn’t be putting him on a pedestal | Tayo Bero But the question of representation has always been a little more subtle. Banks was its first cover star of colour in 1997; Valentina Sampaio the first transgender cover star in 2020; Yumi Nu the first plus-sized model of Asian descent in 2022; Martha Stewart, of course, the first 81-year-old. The magazine parades this diversity with flourish and self-congratulation, as though it is making the world a more inclusive space for marginalised groups. However, in following issues, models will revert to the mean. Real change would look different from this: it would look like a different body shape every issue – it’s not as though there’s an exhaustible supply. For example, eventually, plus-size would cease to exist as a concept, since the idea of “plus” relies on the concept of a single, constant, ideal size. The prospect of that kind of radicalism evaporates when the foe is dressing itself up as an ally; in its place, a piecemeal inclusivity, where “old” is very now for a season and then very last year. I would contrast Sports Illustrated Swimwear Issue with May’s Vogue: Reframing Fashion features 19 disabled people from fashion, arts, sport and activism, five of them as cover stars. The concept is the same, the underpinning is different: Vogue’s editor Edward Enninful himself has disabilities and worked closely with the disability activist Sinéad Burke, who is a consulting editor on the magazine. If you want representation to stick, it has to be in the foundations and not just dressing in the windows.

    <head>Terry Millward obituary</head>
    <body>My father, Terry Millward, who has died aged 84, was an English teacher and chorister who managed to combine his two interests by working at schools in three cathedral cities – Durham, Bristol and Lincoln. He was born in Leatherhead, Surrey, to Mick, an RAF flight engineer who died in a Lancaster bomber during the second world war, and his wife, Joyce (nee Kimberley), a school secretary and later a GP practice manager. Terry was a pupil at City of London Freemen’s school in Ashtead, Surrey, before becoming a reporter on two trade journals, British Baker and Rubber Journal, and then the Surrey County Advertiser. In 1960 he decided his true vocation lay elsewhere, and took a general degree at Bede College, Durham University, after which he became an English teacher at the Malory school in Bromley, south-east London. In 1966 he returned to the north-east of England to teach English at Durham chorister school, where among his pupils was the future comedian Rowan Atkinson, whom he remembered as a “very shy boy”. During Terry’s four years at the school he was also a tenor chorister at Durham Cathedral. In 1970 he began a two-year spell at St Mary Redcliffe and Temple school in Bristol, continuing with his singing at Bristol Cathedral. He then moved in 1972 to Lincoln, teaching at William Farr school in the nearby village of Welton, where he was appointed head of English and later head of year 11, working there for 24 years until his retirement in 1996. During that time he in the choir at Lincoln Cathedral until 1990, also becoming senior lay vicar there. Words, in any format, were Terry’s passion. He was an avid Guardian reader, and the cryptic crossword was his daily relaxation – usually accompanied by a pipe. He really enjoyed the bank holiday editions when the crosswords were more challenging. He even set his own crosswords, and was delighted to receive a letter from the Guardian saying his puzzles would have been of a suitable standard to be published had they needed a setter at the time. Limericks, lyrics and books were also a great interest – in fact any play on words or unusual use of words. Scrabble was his game – the decent word was always more important to him than the score. He never tired of looking things up or finding answers to questions in the many reference books that were available in the family home. He met Rosalind Killick in the choir of Leatherhead church, and they married in 1965. She survives him, as do his two children, Philip and me, and three grandchildren, Clara, Tom and Theo.</body>

    <head>Airstrikes hit Khartoum as fighting between Sudanese factions intensifies</head>
    <body>Airstrikes and artillery fire shook much of Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, and its neighbouring cities on Tuesday as fighting between the country’s warring factions intensified sharply. New battles between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) flared from dawn in north and south Khartoum, as well as in the adjacent cities of Omdurman and Bahri, as the army sought to defend its bases from its paramilitary rival. The army has been trying to cut off RSF supply lines from outside the capital, as well as to secure strategic sites including the airport in central Khartoum and the al-Jaili oil refinery in Bahri, observers said. The RSF claimed to have captured 700 regular soldiers in an attack on an army base in the al-Jaili district, in addition to a large ammunition dump. The RSF’s chief media officer shared a clip on a journalists’ WhatsApp group showing hundreds of captive army soldiers walking in single file, some barefoot and none with weapons. There was no immediate response from the army and the clips have not been verified. Both sides have frequently made exaggerated or otherwise misleading claims during the more than four weeks of fighting. Interactive Talks in Saudi Arabia between representatives of the warring factions have failed to stem the violence, which has killed between 600 and 1,000 people so far, according to government officials and medics. The real toll is expected to be far higher, with many reports of corpses left in the streets and people struggling to bury the dead. The fighting between forces loyal to Sudan’s de facto military ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who leads the RSF, started on 15 April. Both believe they can win a military victory that would bring them absolute authority over Sudan’s 46 million inhabitants, its crumbling state and valuable natural resources. Eyewitnesses in different parts of Omdurman, which lies on the west bank of the Nile River, saw RSF forces withdrawing over the last 48 hours, apparently to launch new offensives in Khartoum to the south-east. Related: Sudan: Reports of women being raped in Khartoum by armed men A resident of Bahri’s al-Khojalab neighbourhood told the Guardian he had seen RSF forces in dozens of pickup trucks. “Now there are very loud sounds of artillery and all sorts of weapons … we don’t [know] what’s going on,” the resident said. The neighbourhood is on the opposite bank of the Nile to the Wadi Seidna airfield, from where the army has been launching airstrikes against the RSF. Heavy fighting has also been taking place in Khartoum’s Jabra neighbourhood, where Dagalo and many of his senior commanders are based. At least two civilians were killed in a hospital on the eastern banks of the Blue Nile in Khartoum by an airstrike carried out by the Sudanese army, according to Dr Houida el-Hassan, a former doctor at the hospital. The army said it had attacked a supply storage facility for the RSF and claimed the hospital was used by the RSF as a supply dump. Six civilians were killed 10 days ago in a similar airstrike in front of the hospital. The RSF has been accused of occupying several hospitals after expelling patients and medical staff. About 80% of the hospitals in Khartoum are out of service and most pharmacies are shut. The pharmacies union issued a statement accusing the RSF of blocking deliveries of medicine to areas outside Khartoum. The RSF is also accused of seizing people’s houses to use them as temporary strongholds from which its soldiers are targeting the military. Widespread reports of sexual assaults by fighters have emerged in recent days. “The situation is unbearable. We left our house to go to a neighbour’s house in Khartoum, escaping from the war, but the bombardment follows us wherever we go,” Ayman Hassan, a 32-year-old resident, told Reuters. “We don’t know what the citizens did to deserve a war in the middle of the houses.” Much of Khartoum has been ruined in the fighting, with food and fuel increasingly scare and expensive. Charred aircraft lie on the asphalt of the once busy international airport; foreign embassies are shuttered, and hospitals, banks, shops and wheat silos have been ransacked by looters. One large market in Omdurman has been burning for two days after being emptied and then set alight by thieves. What remains of the government has retreated to Port Sudan, about 520 miles (840km) away, which has been the hub for recent mass evacuations of foreigners and many Sudanese citizens. The UN says almost 200,000 people have fled Sudan, and another 700,000 have been internally displaced by the conflict. The fighting has triggered unrest in other areas of Sudan, especially in the western region of Darfur and the southern Kordofan regions. The talks in Jeddah brokered by Saudi Arabia and the US have produced a statement of principles about providing access for aid supplies and protecting civilians, but mechanisms for setting up humanitarian corridors and agreeing to a ceasefire are still being discussed.

    <head>England cut is harsh on Foakes but Bairstow decision offers Ashes clarity</head>
    <body>Surrey didn’t hang about. Just 10 minutes after the England squad was announced, confirming Jonny Bairstow’s return behind the stumps for Ireland and thus the start of the Ashes summer, and with Ben Foakes missing from the list of 15 players, the club’s Twitter feed fired up in solidarity with the fall guy. “The best keeper in the world was at it again last week,” read the pointed post, accompanied by a lightning emoji and a video of his silken glove work during the win against Middlesex. Alec Stewart gave Foakes that title a couple of years back and Ben Stokes, a Test captain not prone to hyperbole, has repeated it a good few times since. But in the end, with Bairstow fit again and keeping for Yorkshire following that gruesome leg break, and his stand-in, Harry Brook, having scorched his way through the Test winter in truly eye-catching fashion, the panel had to find a way to accommodate the player who didn’t so much start the so-called Bazball revolution as blast it into orbit. Related: Jofra Archer out of Ashes after recurrence of elbow stress fracture They could have delayed the call, putting both men in the squad to face Ireland at Lord’s from 1 June. But while it has angered a good few supporters, tapping into that longstanding English debate about keepers and keeper-batters, Stokes, Rob Key, Brendon McCullum and co cannot be accused of dithering. Naming Dan Lawrence as the spare batter also means clarity for all concerned. It is a pretty cruel blow for Foakes, although not as cruel as the news that Jofra Archer will be out for the rest of the summer after that expert-confounding elbow stress fracture recurred. This was the biggest gut punch in the press release and where the two parties go from here, central contracts and all, is far from straightforward. But Foakes does have grounds to feel aggrieved. Over the past 12 months he has largely kept up those standards with the gloves, turned around the series against South Africa with a fine hundred at Old Trafford, and been one half of four century stands. As Key admitted, the 30-year-old has played a big part in the run of 10 wins from 12 Tests. Ben Foakes (front right) runs out New Zealand’s Tim Southee at Trent Bridge. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian Equally, while upset, Foakes will not have been totally surprised. He has been here before, St Lucia in 2019 to be precise, when he was jettisoned for Bairstow before an Ashes summer. And during his media outings over the recent winter – a winter which included being left out to accommodate an extra fast bowler in Multan – there was admission that Bairstow’s return was likely and his best bet was not to stress it. As Foakes broods, it may be that he rues that epic final-day defeat in Wellington in February where, having clawed England back into the chase, he holed out seven runs short of the target. Had he taken his team across the line, the agonising Key and his consiglieres experienced would have been greater still. This need not be the end, though, with injuries possible and his excellence on spinning tracks likely needed for the five‑Test tour of India next year. Ben Stokes (Durham, captain), Jimmy Anderson (Lancashire), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Harry Brook (Yorkshire), Zak Crawley (Kent), Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire), Dan Lawrence (Essex), Jack Leach (Somerset), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Matthew Potts (Durham), Ollie Robinson (Sussex), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Mark Wood (Durham). Some will argue it didn’t have to be a binary decision. Zak Crawley’s lurching, too often flatlining, returns from opener would make him vulnerable in other sides. The notion of Stokes moving up felt fanciful, but Bairstow? He has opened just once in first-class cricket, admittedly, but given the job England are demanding at the top of the order, a personal view is his 50-over game could possibly have been transplanted. Cricketers are not automata, however, and convincing Bairstow would not have been straightforward. It was probably too late in the project, not least given a venomous new‑ball attack such as Australia’s (no disrespect to Ireland). And McCullum, the head coach, has also been consistent that, for all his tactical innovation, crowbarring players into unfamiliar slots is not his style. Bairstow (or Brook) as opener would have been going against this principle; Bairstow as wicketkeeper is not. Related: Leicestershire offer parable for English cricket: teams should serve, not just sell | Jonathan Liew England have seemingly concluded that the potential power Bairstow offers with the bat at No 7 – along with more than competent keeping – makes him the option Australia would least prefer. The Yorkshireman may average just 26 in home Ashes but that century in Sydney in 2022, and that hot streak of four in five innings last summer, is more relevant. For all the disappointment over Foakes, it is not a selectorial Hail Mary. Elsewhere, the squad largely picked itself given available resources. Jimmy Anderson is touch and go for Ireland – two weeks out is the chat – and Chris Woakes is a proven option behind Stuart Broad, Ollie Robinson and Matthew Potts. Mark Wood, the last of the fast men standing, has not played a first-class match since Pakistan but in recent times has shown he can tailor his preparation sufficiently without this. Along with Bairstow’s return to the demands of a dual role so soon after a major injury, questions now surround whether Stokes is able to bowl, whether Brook can recapture his form after a struggle in the Indian Premier League, and whether this move to plump for almost outright aggression from one to seven in the lineup can work in the white heat of an Ashes contest. As ever, the beauty comes in finding out.</body>

    <head>Katie Taylor gets Dublin homecoming but a shadow lingers over Irish boxing</head>
    <body>The lonely passion of Katie Taylor will feel more intense than ever on Saturday night in Dublin. As the most significant female boxer in the world, and the most cherished sporting personality in Ireland, Taylor will fight professionally in her home country for the first time. At 36, as an Olympic champion with a flawless 22-0 pro record, Taylor remains remarkably humble and devoted to boxing. But uncertainty surrounds her homecoming. Taylor, the undisputed world lightweight champion, has moved up a division to challenge Chantelle Cameron who defends all her belts as the imposing super-lightweight world champion at the 3Arena – less than three miles from the scene of a gangland murder which prevented major boxing promotions in Ireland for the past seven years. On 5 February 2016 at the Regency Hotel a boxing weigh-in was invaded by four gunmen who killed David Byrne, a member of the Kinahan drug-running gang. The attackers were linked to the Hutch gang and the Irish police, the Garda, believe their intended target was Daniel Kinahan. The murderous feud between the Kinahan and Hutch cartels had been sparked by a different shooting in August 2014. Jamie Moore, who will be in Cameron’s corner as her chief trainer, was shot twice outside Kinahan’s home near Marbella. It was another case of mistaken identity as the authorities eventually established that the shooters had been aiming to kill Kinahan. A month later, while convalescing at home in Manchester, Moore told me how lucky he had been, as one bullet missed an artery by millimetres, and that Kinahan was “a good bloke” in the sense that he supported boxers. But it has since been accepted in the Irish courts that the Kinahan Organised Crime Group is “involved in drug trafficking, money laundering and gangland executions” worth more than a billion dollars. Daniel Kinahan fled Ireland soon after the Regency attack and he, his father and his brother have been wanted by the Garda and European law enforcement agencies. In 2020, in the Irish parliament, Leo Varadkar discussed these criminal activities with concern and, in regard to Kinahan seeking refuge in Dubai, the Taoiseach, said: ‘While I cannot comment on any particular Garda operation, I can certainly assure you that there has been contact between [Ireland’s] Department of Foreign Affairs and the authorities in the United Arab Emirates.’” In 2012 Kinahan had set up a boxing management company called MGM, with Matthew Macklin, whom Moore had fought against in 2006 before becoming his trainer. MGM eventually became known as MTK Global. Katie Taylor will be cheered on by her adoring fans in Dublin on Saturday. Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters Kinahan established himself as a boxing power-broker, and continued despite being in hiding, and MTK represented hundreds of fighters across Britain, Ireland and the US. They instigated a ban on all Irish media who shone a light on MTK’s links with Kinahan. Meanwhile, 18 people have been murdered in the ongoing war between the Kinahan and Hutch gangs. As a result the Garda and insurance companies refused to support professional boxing in Ireland. There have been some small-hall shows but not one promotion of consequence since 2016. Taylor, an Olympic champion who turned pro that year, has been shut out of her own country. Despite being deeply private, she has been hurt by her exile. Her homecoming will spark an emotional reunion with her adoring fans but the Kinahan saga and the looming battle with Cameron make this a fraught week. Eric Donovan, a close friend of Taylor’s since they were both on the Irish team in the late 1990s, says: “Katie is such a gentle soul, almost saint-like, but when the bell goes she transforms into this absolute machine and becomes a bad ass. It’s a beautiful, extraordinary thing.” Donovan, who retired from boxing last November as the European super-featherweight champion, adds: “I have to remind myself that Katie Taylor is a global superstar. In Ireland, she is godly. But she’s just Katie to me, my friend and great old sparring partner who gave me a few digs.” Kieran Cunningham, a Dublin journalist who has covered Taylor’s career for 15 years, has made an absorbing and fascinating four-part podcast called Untouchable: How Katie Taylor Changed the World. “An annual survey identifies the most admired sportsperson in Ireland,” he says. “Katie wins year after year at a canter. In second place you would have, depending on the time, Roy Keane, Brian O’Driscoll or Rory McIlroy. Big stars in global sports. Katie’s so understated but people like the quietness in her that contradicts what they see in the ring. But being a game-changer is the main reason she’s so admired.” Cunningham’s podcast is strong on Taylor’s cultural impact on a country which, for centuries, showed particular prejudice against women. He explains how it was written in the Irish constitution that a woman’s place was in the home and his interviewees describe how female rights to contraception, abortion and divorce were shunned. “Irish women were drowning in babies,” recalls Rosita Sweetman, a founding member of the Irish Women’s Liberation Movement in 1972. Eimear Ryan, an Irish writer who is a similar age to the boxer, acknowledges that Taylor would describe herself as a fighter, and a Christian, rather than a feminist. But Ryan is in awe of Taylor’s pioneering role. In 2001, aged 15, Taylor fought in the first officially sanctioned female boxing bout in Ireland. Cunningham also points out that Taylor is one of the main reasons why women’s boxing became part of the Olympics. In November 2007, Taylor and Canada’s Katie Dunn fought an exhibition to gauge whether women’s boxing was worthy of an Olympic slot. “Taylor fought out of her skin,” Cunningham says. “She won over the doubters and women’s boxing was given a ticket to the five-ringed circus.” It took Donovan time to understand his friend’s importance: “Katie was just one of the lads to me. She was so good but, at 13, I was too young to understand the magnitude of this one girl taking part in a man’s sport.” Katie Taylor celebrates after her extraordinary win over Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden in April 2022. Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Getty Images Taylor would spar with a future two-weight world champion in Carl Frampton – and her gym wars with Paddy Barnes, who won two Olympic medals, became legendary. But Donovan sparred with her more than anyone. “I used to be the opposite of Katie,” he says. “I was an extrovert, a bit wild, but Katie was a huge part of my life. We sparred from 15 and I was her chief sparring partner for London 2012.” Donovan’s expression clouds briefly. “That was bittersweet because I was a prime candidate for those Olympics. I was in the world top 10 but I had mental issues from childhood trauma. I slipped into addiction.” He broke his hand during a drunken scrap and lost his chance to fight at the 2012 Games. Donovan slid into depression but “our coach rang me up and said: ‘Look, Eric, will you go to Italy, spar Katie, get her ready for Sofya Ochigava’ – the Russian girl she’d meet in the final. She’s a southpaw. I’m a southpaw. She beat Katie before. She was a big threat. “Katie was under immense pressure. A huge banner of Katie covered the side of a building in Dublin. It said: ‘Only the strongest shoulders can carry the hopes of a nation.’ Here was a woman with the hopes of a nation to win Olympic gold and she was my friend needing my help. I had to see it as a privilege even though I felt I should have been competing. But it was lovely to be a small part of Katie’s success.” Cunningham remembers that, before Taylor beat Ochigava in the final, “her first fight was at the Excel Arena against Natasha Jonas. The crowd broke the decibel record at those Games because Katie’s Irish supporters made more noise than Super Saturday [when Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford won gold for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics].” Ireland’s love affair with the reclusive Taylor has deepened despite the absence of professional boxing. And last April it seemed as if the net had closed on Kinahan. At an extraordinary press conference in Dublin, the US government vowed to bring Kinahan, and named associates, to justice. MTK collapsed soon afterwards and it seemed that Kinahan’s pernicious hold on boxing had been broken. But there are persistent rumours Kinahan is still negotiating deals for fighters and talking to major promoters. Cunningham says: “Boxing has carried on as normal. Nothing in terms of its governance has changed. People say Kinahan is pulling the strings behind the scenes with some big fights.” The Regency shooting has been headline news again. Gerry Hutch was acquitted of murdering Byrne and released from prison in April. But last Friday two men were found guilty of providing getaway vehicles from the Regency and sentenced to lengthy jail terms. There are other uncomfortable reminders in the build-up to Taylor’s homecoming. After Cameron became the undisputed world champion in Abu Dhabi last November she was joined in the ring by Anthony Fitzpatrick. For Cunningham, “Fitzpatrick is an important figure even if we don’t know his exact connection to Cameron. “Fitzpatrick had a key managerial role in MTK and he lived in a mansion in Dublin owned by Kinahan. That mansion was seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau last year. There’s no suggestion Fitzpatrick has any involvement in criminality, but he does have connections to Kinahan. I’ve sent a request to Cameron’s team asking about the connection to Fitzpatrick and whether, following the court linking him to Kinahan, they had any concerns. I didn’t get a response.” As Cunningham stresses, there is no evidence that Fitzpatrick has ever condoned or been involved in any form of criminality. The same applies to Cameron who is focused on her boxing career. She only joined MTK in February 2019 – at a time when the company had distanced itself from Kinahan. Cunningham, one of the most dogged reporters on Kinahan’s trail, says: “It’s right that questions are asked. Jamie Moore has been supportive of Kinahan. At the press conference in Dublin I asked him whether he regrets that support. He said: ‘We’re not here to talk about that. We’re here to focus on the fight.’ I said this fight is taking place in the north inner city where most people in the Kinahan feud were killed. It’s also the first big fight since all this exploded. He stonewalled again.” There has been another undertow in Cameron’s insistence that Ellie Scotney be removed from Saturday’s bill. Scotney is trained by Shane McGuigan who also used to train Cameron until she joined MTK. The fallout between Cameron and the McGuigan family has been bitter. Following the Scotney furore, Cameron said in an online statement she had been treated badly by the McGuigans. Shane McGuigan rejected that charge in a detailed reply. Separately, there is also animosity towards Barry McGuigan, Shane’s father and the former world champion, from those who support MTK and Kinahan. McGuigan Sr was the only person in boxing brave enough to talk out about Kinahan’s malign influence over the fight game in a BBC Panorama investigation in 2021. A wanted poster displayed at a press conference at Dublin City Hall last year after it was announced that the US government is offering $5m for information on the Kinahan crime gang or for the arrest and conviction of its leaders. Photograph: No Credit Cunningham and Donovan express trepidation when considering Cameron’s threat in the ring. “I’ve talked to a few people who really know boxing and they think Cameron will beat Taylor,” Cunningham says of the Northampton fighter who has won all 17 of her fights. Donovan admits: “You can see the size difference. I’m confident of Katie winning but this is a very dangerous fight. There’s absolutely no doubt this could go wrong.” In describing Taylor’s “lonely passion”, which alludes to Brian Moore’s moving Belfast novel, The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne, Cunningham evokes her extraordinary resolve in the solitary business of boxing. But he believes “Katie will feel real pressure because the fight will dominate news bulletins all week and 95% of the crowd will be behind her. It’s a massive test.” Taylor is often at her best under searing pressure. She showed that last April when, in one of the greatest fights I have seen live, she beat Amanda Serrano in the first women’s bout to headline Madison Square Garden. “She came through that storm and finished like a train,” Donovan recalls. “Something similar might happen here but Cameron is strong.” Donovan pauses when considering Taylor’s homecoming after the Regency murder brought boxing to a halt in Ireland. “It was terrible. Irish boxing never recovered and it’s only now we’re starting to see a resurrection. The sad part is that boxing provides so much opportunity for marginalised communities. Boxing puts respect and pride into those communities and makes champions of people who might not have other opportunities. The sport I love got dragged into the gutter but Katie is helping bring back the glory. We are only a small island, but some of the greatest nights in this country have come in a boxing ring.” Taylor has shaped some of those great nights, in rings far from home, and she now has a chance to do so again in Dublin. “I actually felt she should have walked away after she beat Serrano,” Donovan says. “She had changed the game forever. But the closer we come to this fight the more I understand that boxing is her life. How can you even suggest to somebody who lives for boxing that she should give up? Whenever I am with Katie I see a complete and wholesome person who is hungry to keep raising the bar in boxing. She’s incredible.”</body>

    <head>Mervyn Kohler obituary</head>
    <body>My father, Mervyn Kohler, who has died aged 74, dedicated his career to bringing about changes in society through his work for charities and in politics. He was born in Edinburgh to Dorie (nee Footer), an infants’ school teacher, and Frank Kohler, who worked at the London Assurance Company. Mervyn was always very proud of his Scottish roots, despite having moved south, to Croydon, as a child. He attended the Trinity school of John Whitgift in Croydon, before going on to Durham University, where he met Liz Johnson, a fellow student. They married in 1970 and had two children. Liz went on to become a deputy headteacher. Mervyn started working for Shelter in 1971, coordinating local groups in the East Anglia and Lincolnshire region, but quickly moved on to the Conservative party, developing its approach to race and ethnicity. He was appointed OBE in 1984. However, he spent most of his working life at Help the Aged, later known as Age UK. He had different roles at the charity, starting as head of public affairs in 1984, but was perhaps best known for his media appearances as external affairs adviser – a role in which he frequently articulated complex policy analysis on radio and TV and in print to help the public understand the human implications of issues such as fuel poverty, pension credit and care needs. Throughout his career, he served as a trustee for a number of charities, as well as on public bodies such as the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group. He managed to carve much of his day-to-day working life around issues that fascinated him, and did not want to stop working. He did, however, retire in March 2020. His health deteriorated, and he and Liz found the isolation and confinement that Covid-19 lockdown brought extremely difficult. They had thrived on going to the theatre, concerts and exhibitions in London, as well as travelling to destinations near and far, and those activities became impossible. After lockdown they resumed travelling together again, visiting my family in France, and their volunteering and other leisure activities, but Mervyn’s mobility had become limited. Liz died in 2021. Mervyn is survived by his children, Joe and me, his grandchildren, Shay, Amani, Gemma and Elsa, and his sister, Jan.</body>

    <head>The sleepy Dorset town bewildered by a ‘random’ arson rampage</head>
    <body>“Shocking, isn’t it?” said hairdresser Jackie Shearing, gazing at the burnt-out shell of a hatchback wedged in a passageway close to the centre of Wimborne Minster. “This is such a dozy old town, nothing ever happens here.” The day before something certainly had happened. The Dorset town awoke to find it had been caught up in a series of arson attacks, which wrecked 13 cars in the area, damaged a historic building and left residents dashing around trying to save themselves and their vehicles. On Tuesday police carried out forensic tests on the vehicles, got on with door-to-door inquiries and tried to work out who had caused the damage and why. The smell of burning remained in the air as residents of Wimborne, which has a magnificent minister church and was once home to Thomas Hardy, expressed bafflement and anger at what had happened. A photograph by Chloe Torring showing her car on fire (left) as 12 vehicles were set on ablaze in Wimborne, Dorset. Photograph: Chloe Torring/PA Some thought the spread and swiftness of the attacks, which took place over three hours on the night of 14to 15 May over a three-mile route, must be the work of a gang. Others thought it the work of an individual who may have used an old railway line, the Castleman Trailway, to navigate between spots, keeping hidden in the trees. “If it was one person, he was very organised,” said Paul Dear, who spent 20 years in the fire service. “He knew what he was doing. He was in and out.” The hero of the hour was nurse Lisa Dodd, who had just arrived home in the early hours of Monday when she saw a Nissan Micra ablaze in the passageway. A mother and two daughters had just moved into a flat nearby and were asleep 2 metres from the blaze. Nurse Lisa Dodd spotted the burning car in a courtyard and warned a mother and her two daughters, who were sleeping in a flat directly next to it. Photograph: Max Willcock/BNPS “The light seemed a bit off and when I looked out I saw the bonnet of the car on fire,” Dodd said. “I knew that there was a sleeping family in the room next to the fire and I was worried that the car would explode. I ran out to wake them up and get them out.” The family managed to squeeze out through a gap less than half a metre wide between their door and the blazing car. “If the engine had exploded and set the door on fire there would have been no way out,” said Dodd. “I got to them just in time. It doesn’t bear thinking about what could have happened. This isn’t just some senseless vandalism. This is something else. It has scared everybody around here. We’re worried it could happen again.” The fire also damaged timbers in the listed building but that was the least of residents’ worries. Florist Keith Dorling dropped off flowers to Lisa’s doorstep. “As a thank you from the community,” he said. “What’s happened here is disgusting. Someone could have been killed.” The spread-out geography of the attacks suggest they were random, local people believe. They began around three miles south (an 11-minute drive, 50-minute walk) of Wimborne in the leafy village of Broadstone in Poole, where a Ford Focus was set on fire between the tennis and golf clubs. Wimborne residents said the town looked like a war zone after the attacks. Photograph: Max Willcock/BNPS It was parked next to a break in the fence on the Castleman Trailway. The second attack was about 2 miles away at Oakley Hill – very close to the trailway route. The suspected arsonist or arsonists might then have crossed the River Stour into the Wimborne area where cars were set on fire in the New Borough Road area. Paul Russell, 55, dashed out of his flat there and quickly moved his brand-new Hyundai, which was parked beside a burning vehicle. “I grew up in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 80s and haven’t seen anything like this since then,” he said. One resident, who asked not to be named, said his CCTV caught an alleged suspect. “He had his jacket over his head,” he said. “He bent down next to the car. He put something under the car and then walked off down the road. It didn’t take long for whatever it was to go off.” He has given the footage to the police. Assistant Manager Melissa Cox outside the Coach and Horses pub said people in the area are afraid. Photograph: Max Willcock/BNPS Detectives appealed for witnesses on Monday but made no comment on Tuesday, leaving people worried about what was happening and whether there was a risk of more fires. “There are a lot of scared people around here,” said Melissa Cox, the assistant manager of the Coach and Horses pub. “A couple of regulars lost their cars. I think it’s fair to say everyone is on tenterhooks.”</body>

    <head>Michael Gove leaves everyone feeling they’ve been NatConned</head>
    <body>You might wonder what a cabinet minister is doing at a National Conservatism conference. A group of conspiracy theorists and populist weirdos that already assumes the Conservatives have failed and are fighting for the soul of the party in opposition. That most Tory MPs need to be deselected in favour of candidates with purer Conservative thoughts. On Monday, Suella Braverman hadn’t given it a second thought. No opportunity to stoke the culture wars should ever be passed up. A chance to meet her tribe, her fanbase. To stake a claim as a leader in waiting. Michael Gove had clearly had his doubts. It may have seemed like a good idea when he was asked – he’s easily flattered as his self-worth is through the floor these days. But now he found himself on stage at the Emmanuel Centre in London in front of an audience of a couple of hundred people, he wasn’t quite so sure. Time was when Gove was a player. Someone who made things happen. These days, he’s a lost soul. No real friends anywhere. He just drifts aimlessly around Westminster. A man without real influence, surviving on a reputation for competence that doesn’t bear close examination. Next stop oblivion. So Mikey No Mates no longer had any skin in the game. There was nothing to be gained by indulging in some blue-on-blue attacks on his colleagues. All he could really do was try to talk his way through his half-hour interview with the Daily Telegraph’s Madeline Grant without saying anything very much of interest. Certainly nothing that could get him into trouble with any of his colleagues. For the first time in his life, Gove was going to be the most moderate person in the room. Imagine that. To most people’s horror, Gove began by declaring himself to be socially liberal. Cue a sharp intake of breath from an audience that had come to be pampered. To be love-bombed. To be told they were right. It was almost as if he was going out of his way to deliberately troll the Nat Cons. An impression that was heightened when he delicately pointed out that being in power – running a government – was a wee bit more complicated than just yelling mad shit from the sidelines. The housing and levelling up secretary then calmed down and assumed cruise control. Mainlining Valium into the nervous systems of all concerned. It was all perfectly normal for the archbishop of Canterbury to think Conservative policy immoral. This didn’t go down well. The Nat Cons core belief is that God is a conservative. It was a sign the party was in robust health that there were so many people fighting like rats in a sack and the government was failing to meet almost all its policy objectives. But he didn’t want the Nat Cons to worry their pretty little heads about anything so mundane as running a country. They could just chill out a bit and play at rightwing politics for their own amusement. Grant tried to play devil’s advocate to liven things up a bit. But the Govester refused to play ball. Everything was wonderful. The government was wonderful and had performed heroically over the last 13 years, constantly reinventing itself to the delight of a lucky electorate. Rishi Sunak was wonderful. Boris Johnson was wonderful. Braverman was wonderful. Every Tory MP was wonderful. And the Nat Cons were simply adorable too. So sweet with their darling, populist fantasies. “We Conservatives don’t polarise the world into the woke or unwoke,” he said. A bad misjudgement. Because the Nat Cons live for the culture wars. They’ve no idea how to run an economy – their explanation for Liz Truss wrecking the country is that she didn’t get the chance to wreck it even more – so the only battles they think they can win are the culture wars. Moving on. Mikey No Mates did have one confession to make. It was really hard to get on the property ladder. No shit. Insight after insight. Pearl after pearl. Only this was the housing secretary as good as admitting that he had failed. However, he chose to blame the migrants. Bloody foreigners. Still, better to build one beautiful house than tens of thousands generic new builds. But no one raised an eyebrow or a complaint. Mainly because they were all dozing off. It had been a long few days being angry about everything. Asked to name the successes of the last 13 years, the Govester struggled. Universal credit, he offered hopefully. Strangely, he didn’t feel the urge to mention Brexit, despite it being the one legacy that has his fingerprints indelibly all over it. Perhaps it just slipped his mind. Or maybe he feels too much guilt. Though the Nat Cons would have been happy to grant him absolution. They are hot on original sin. Nor did anyone bring up Truss. So polite. “We will win the next election,” Gove concluded. He didn’t really sound as if he believed it. The Nat Cons shrugged. They don’t care one way or the other. The current bunch of Tories aren’t real Conservatives after all. Bring the whole lot down. They mean it, man. Still, if the Tories did lose there would be more time to read Edmund Burke, Jane Austen and George Eliot. Oh, and Roger Scruton. The mention of Scruton drew Gove’s only round of applause. From those that hadn’t been bored to death. There had been more traditional Nat Con nonsense earlier in the day. Starting with a speech from American rightwing populist Kevin Roberts that referenced Donald Trump, Viktor Orbán and antisemitic globalist tropes, and finishing with the UK academic Matthew Goodwin who insists he has been cancelled despite being invited to speak on almost every media platform. For Goodwin, we had reached the end of days. The Tory party was past its sell-by date. We were being governed by a liberal, university-educated elite. Much like Goodwin. Matty also doesn’t seem to have asked himself how this all-powerful elite had let Brexit happen. Maybe they were too busy being all powerful that they took their eye off the ball. He’s also never asked himself why the media are dominated by rightwing, populist platforms. Still, he went down a storm. And he does take himself very seriously which is all that matters to the Nat Cons. Because they feel this is their time. With that, the oppressed minority of two cabinet ministers, Jacob Rees-Mogg and several lords went off to plan the revolution.</body>

    <head>Curtis Jones’ patience rewarded with key role in Liverpool’s winning run</head>
    <body>It is almost a year since Lee Carsley spelled out what he wanted from Curtis Jones. “I expect more from him,” the England Under-21s head coach said. “He’s got to be the best player every day, every game. I think he can score more, I think he can assist more. He needs to show it on a regular basis for us.” It has taken time but Jones showing it on a regular basis for Liverpool, and helping to revive his boyhood club’s Champions League hopes in the process, is deserved reward for a player whose patience has been tested to the limit while waiting for an opportunity to meet the demands Carsley outlined. Related: Curtis Jones double for Liverpool damages Leicester’s survival hopes Jones impressed and scored again as Liverpool made it seven Premier League wins in succession at relegation-haunted Leicester on Monday. The 22-year-old has started each victory, and Liverpool’s past nine matches, with his form and Jürgen Klopp’s ability to finally select a consistent midfield contributing to the team’s stirring end-of-season recovery. Gareth Southgate, watching at the King Power Stadium, was given more to ponder than Trent Alexander-Arnold’s blossoming as a hybrid midfielder as Jones showed how effective he can be in the midfield system the England manager often favours. The inevitable question has been raised of what Jones’s performances mean for the planned rebuild of Liverpool’s midfield this summer, with two or three signings long expected for that department. The simple answer is nothing. A top club’s transfer strategy, devised and analysed for at least a year, does not change radically on the back of one young player’s re-emergence. James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keïta will still be leaving on free transfers. And besides, Liverpool have always known what they have in Jones: a prodigious talent with a consistent end product throughout the academy ranks, technically superb, a big and popular personality and a player who was accepted by the first-team squad as soon as he was promoted to their ranks. No mean feat in a squad at the height of its Premier League and Champions League winning powers. Trent Alexander-Arnold (left) and Curtis Jones after the win at Leicester. Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty Images Every young player has to bide their time when surrounded by world-class talent, but Jones’s wait was also frustrated by misfortune. Two freakish, painful injuries stalled his development in the past two seasons. He missed six weeks of last season with a scratched eyeball sustained in a collision during training. A stress reaction of the tibia sidelined the midfielder for 10 weeks of the current campaign and necessitated a programme of carefully managed treatment, training and recovery time. Any fears Jones could be left behind by missing so much football at a crucial phase in his career have been dispelled by his recent, consistent and prominent run in the side. “He could watch a lot of football, he could understand the game better [while sidelined] and it looks really like that,” said Klopp after Leicester. “Where he improved the most is counter-pressing – it’s exceptional – and speed of play. He doesn’t keep the ball that long any more – he does that, and has to do in moments, but he is much quicker in decision-making.” Jones is one of several players, Fabinho included, who have benefited from Alexander-Arnold’s positional shift. The creation of an extra midfielder in possession has given Jones freedom to attack in the knowledge there is more cover behind. His two almost identical goals against Leicester and Tottenham, when arriving at the back post to volley home a cross from the right, are exactly what Klopp wants to see from players of Jones’s ability. The Liverpool manager is adamant the talent from Toxteth has not had a bad season, he just didn’t have the opportunity for a good one. Jones is making up for lost time as well as pushing himself up the pecking order of Liverpool midfielders. He is, to adapt Carsley’s words, showing he can perform for his boyhood team on a regular basis. Klopp will demand that Jones continues to star for them, too.</body>

    <head>What is the US debt ceiling and what will happen if it is not raised?</head>
    <body>The US faces an “unprecedented economic and financial storm”, the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, warned on Tuesday as Joe Biden met with his Republican counterparts for the latest in a series of tense talks over the US debt ceiling. Related: Danger and deja vu: what 2011 can tell us about the US debt ceiling crisis Time is quickly running out to find a solution, said Yellen. Without raising the debt limit, the US government will default on its bills, a historic first, with likely catastrophic consequences. Federal workers would be furloughed, global stock markets would crash and the US economy would probably drop into a recession. Here is more on the debt ceiling and what it means for the US government: What is the debt ceiling? The debt ceiling is the limit on the amount of money the US government can borrow to pay for services, such as social security, Medicare and the military. Each year, the government takes in revenue from taxes and other streams, such as customs duties, but ultimately spends more than it takes in. This leaves the government with a deficit, which has ranged from $400bn to $3tn each year over the last decade. The deficit left at the end of the year ultimately gets tacked on to the country’s total debt. To borrow money, the US treasury issues securities, like US government bonds, that it will eventually pay back with interest. Once the US government hits its debt limit, the treasury cannot issue more securities, essentially stopping a key flow of money into the federal government. Congress is in charge of setting the debt limit, which currently stands at $31.4tn. The debt ceiling has been raised 78 times since 1960, under both Democrat and Republican presidents. At times, the ceiling was briefly suspended and then reinstated at a higher limit, essentially a retroactive raising of the debt ceiling. Interactive What happens if the US defaults? The US has never defaulted on its payments before, so exactly what will happen is unclear. It’s not likely to be good. “Failure to meet the government’s obligation would cause irreparable harm to the US economy, the livelihoods of all Americans and global financial stability,” the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said in a letter to Congress earlier this year. Investors would lose faith in the US dollar, causing the economy to weaken quickly. Job cuts would be imminent, and the US federal government would not have the means to continue all its services. Mortgage rates would probably soar – tanking the housing market. Why is the US debt so high? The US debt grows when the government is spending more money or when its revenue is lower. Interactive Throughout its history, the US has had at least some amount of debt. But the debt really started to grow in the 80s, after Ronald Reagan’s huge tax cuts. Without as much tax revenue, the government needed to borrow more money to spend. During the 90s, the end of the cold war allowed the government to cut back on defense spending, and a booming economy led to higher tax revenues. But then, in the early 2000s, the dotcom bubble burst, leading to a recession. George W Bush cut taxes twice, in 2001 and 2003, and then the US military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan increased spending by as much as nearly $6tn over the course of the war. When the 2008 Great Recession started, the government had to bulk up spending to bail out banks and increase social services as the unemployment rate hit 10%. When the unemployment rate returned to its pre-recession levels, in 2017, a major tax cut was passed under Donald Trump. The debt rose by $7.8tn while he was in office. Interactive And then the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The US government passed a series of stimulus bills to offset the worst of the pandemic’s impacts that ultimately totaled $5tn. What are the main contributors to federal government spending? The biggest chunk of US government spending goes to mandatory programs, such as social security, Medicaid and Medicare, which comprise nearly half of the overall annual budget. Military spending takes up the biggest chunk of discretionary spending, taking up 12% of the budget. Other big-ticket items include spending on education, employment training and services and benefits for US veterans. Interactive Why isn’t Congress raising the debt ceiling? On 26 April Republicans passed a bill in the House that would raise the debt ceiling by $1.5tn but mandated $4.8tn in spending cuts over a decade. Given the stakes, Democrats have refused to negotiate spending cuts over the debt ceiling. Lawmakers including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have argued that Republicans should bring forth spending cuts during budget negotiations, not over the debt ceiling. Still, Republicans seem adamant on using the high-stakes timeline toward default to pressure Democrats into agreeing to spending cuts. They did this successfully in 2011, when Democrats agreed to spending cuts 72 hours before the government defaulted. This time around, with neither side budging, a continued stalemate could bring the US economy closer to disaster.</body>

    <head>‘Consensus is boring’: Cannes jury president Ruben Östlund opens ‘wild’ festival</head>
    <body>Jury president Ruben Östlund struck a defiant note of optimism on the opening day of the 76th Cannes film festival, positioning the event as a stronghold of community in an increasingly atomised world. Cinema, he said, was more relevant and valuable than ever. The challenge is to connect it with a younger, post-pandemic audience that prefers to gorge its entertainment online. “If you look at today’s world, you see that cinema is unique for the simple reason that it offers a room where we can all watch films together,” he said. “All the other content, we’re accessing it on our devices, in our little bubbles, consuming culture like zombies and not reflecting what we’re looking at. So going to the cinema is almost a political stance. We come together and have a conversation about the world. We find out who we are and where we’re going. That is cinema’s strongest selling point. I think people want that collective experience.” Related: Jeanne du Barry review – Cannes kicks off with Johnny Depp’s purring and peculiar royal dandy Östlund’s view was supported by Iris Knobloch, who is in her inaugural year as the festival’s overall president. Knobloch, the first woman to ever take the role, argued that the traditional model of theatrical distribution remains in good shape, pointing to figures that suggest audience numbers are now creeping back towards pre-pandemic levels. “Films are back in theatres,” she said. “And the public is returning, too. Even the streaming platforms have realised that nothing can replace the experience of releasing a film in the cinema. Streaming is a good addition to the ecosystem, but cinema itself is eternal.” Assuming visitors are able to obtain a ticket, this year’s event provides an analogue feast of feature productions and red-carpet premieres. Potential highlights from the schedule include Martin Scorsese’s 1920s-set epic Killers of the Flower Moon along with Harrison Ford’s swansong appearance as Indiana Jones. Östlund’s focus, however, is on the 21 films selected to compete for the crowning Palme d’Or award. These run the gamut from Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City through to The Zone of Interest, a Holocaust drama from the British director Jonathan Glazer. If a jury is looking for the common denominator, the best film will fall through the cracks Ruben Östlund Östlund arrives in Cannes as a two-time winner, having been awarded the Palme d’Or for both 2017’s The Square and last year’s Triangle of Sadness. Nonetheless he regards himself as a relative newcomer, providing a bridge between the old and new guard of Cannes. The Swedish director began his career shooting skiing videos before branching into film-making with his satires about modern art and the super-rich. Cannes, he admitted, depends on fresh voices like his in order to evolve and survive. “My goal is to represent a new style of European cinema – to create wild, entertaining movies that at the same time are thought-provoking. I think the fact that I’m part of that new conversation is one of the reasons I was offered the position [of jury president]. So I’m pleased to represent the younger players.” Initial evidence appears to bear out his assertion. The average age of the directors in competition this year is 62, with the lineup headed by 83-year-old Marco Bellocchio and 86-year-old Ken Loach. But the average age of the nine-member jury – which includes the Hollywood actors Paul Dano and Brie Larson – is a comparatively youthful 44. Östlund hopes the freshness of his panel will ensure a lively, democratic atmosphere. The aim, he said, was for loud, fun deliberations with plenty of room for dissent. “It’s very important that we fight against the idea of consensus. Consensus is the most boring thing. If a jury is looking for the common denominator, there’s a risk that the best film is going to fall through the cracks. So I’m going to encourage people to fight for the films they really believe in. They should trust in their instincts and not be scared of saying something stupid.” Joining him on the panel is Rungano Nyoni, the Zambian-born, Welsh-raised director of the Bafta-winning I Am Not a Witch, who was happy to admit her lack of festival jury expertise. “I have no strategy,” Nyoni said. “I’m not an intellectual. I’ll try to convince the others about a film that I like. But if they’re not interested, that’s OK, I’ll just go and bitch about it at home.” Related: Cannes defends decision to pick Johnny Depp film as festival opener Outside the Palais, it was business as usual on the festival’s first day as the guests gathered for the world premiere of Jeanne du Barry, a lavish period drama which has already sparked controversy for its casting of Johnny Depp in the role of King Louis XV. Largely filmed in the palace of Versailles, Jeanne du Barry spotlights an elitist 18th-century world of court intrigue and royal romance and celebrates the aristocracy’s last gasp, just before the French nobles lost their heads. After all the talk of democracy and fresh blood, Cannes’ choice of opening film struck some onlookers as telling. The presence of Östlund and his team may signal a gentle changing of the guard. But the old order dies hard.</body>

    <head>‘She was a hustler’: the fascinating true story of Anna Nicole Smith</head>
    <body>In the recent wave of documentaries demanding justice for the tragic blondes of the 1990s – Britney Spears, Princess Diana and Pamela Anderson among them – it’s unsurprising to find a new film about Anna Nicole Smith next in the queue. Related: Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me review – sympathetic retelling of a tragic life Anna Nicole: You Don’t Know Me, a Netflix production directed by Ursula Macfarlane, revisits the life of the titular model and Playboy centerfold best known for marrying an octogenarian billionaire, then very publicly losing it all; in 2007, she was found dead in a Hollywood, Florida, Hard Rock hotel at the young age of 39, having taken a toxic mixture of methadone, Valium and a variety of sedatives. Diverging from the precedents set by the Britney and Diana films, however, this new documentary treats Smith less as a powerless victim of the media than the savvy protagonist of her own story. “She was a hustler,” Macfarlane tells the Guardian. “She made things happen on her own terms.” Smith, born Vickie Lynn Hogan, began her life in the working-class, God-fearing town of Mexia, Texas. “She was born beautiful,” says a voiceover from her late mother, a police officer named Virgie Mae Hogan, as she recalls memories of grown men following her child through the local shopping mall. As an adult, Smith rarely spoke of her childhood except to say that she hated her abusive mother, and Macfarlane pieces together these early years with interviews with her subject’s brother and her uncle. From a young age, they say, Smith was rebelliously enterprising, fixated on gaining both attention and money. She dropped out of high school to get a job at a fried chicken restaurant, where at age 17, she married a co-worker who allegedly kept her locked inside the house. She gave birth to her son Daniel to soothe her own loneliness, then took off with him in pursuit of fame and fortune when he was six months old. “She had an incredible work ethic,” recalls a former co-worker simply known as Missy who witnessed Smith on her early ascent to fame. Smith had modeled her Hollywood persona after the humor of Carol Burnett and the sex appeal of Marilyn Monroe, and played a record of Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend on her first Playboy photoshoot to soothe her camera-shyness. Later revealed to have been lovers, Missy and Smith had met working at a Houston strip club called The Executive Suite, where Missy initially though she was taking a beautiful young novice under her wing. She quickly realized what becomes a recurring theme throughout the film: “No one needed to give her any pointers on how to attract a man … She doesn’t need a lot of help manipulating anybody.” Smith first met the billionaire oil tycoon J Howard Marshall at the strip club in 1991, when he was 86 years old and she was only 23. Media treatment of their relationship had presented Smith as an opportunistic gold digger in Macfarlane’s mind, but during the film-making process, “one of the things that really surprised me was that their relationship, regardless of the distance in decades, was actually genuine,” the director says. “It was love, whatever love means, and it felt very important for us to set the record straight.” The film approaches Smith and Marshall’s relationship with a measured tenderness, offering montages of the couple’s personal photographs and recordings of affectionate phone calls, plus home movies of loving exchanges between Marshall and Smith’s son. (As for how the film-makers got them, says producer Alexandra Lacey: “We can’t disclose the source of those, I’m afraid.”) The film is largely sympathetic to the titular blonde bombshell, touching only briefly on the negative aspects of her marriage. “She was getting to where she was no longer grateful to Mr Marshall, just treating him like an ATM,” Missy says, recalling a change in Smith’s formerly warm-hearted personality as she developed an addiction to painkillers. Footage of a tearful Smith testifying her love for her late husband resounds with a heartfelt authenticity, particularly because she was known for her poor acting skills: “It wasn’t a sexual, ‘Baby oh baby I love your body’ type of love. It was a deep ‘thank you’ for taking me out of this hole, and ‘thank you for saving my life’.” Anna Nicole Smith and J Howard Marshall. Photograph: Sipa Press/Sipa Press / Rex Features Marshall’s death in 1995, just 14 months after their wedding, marks an inflection point in the film where Smith’s upward trajectory quickly turns into a downward spiral. Despite the majority-woman jury, she lost her highly publicized legal battle over her late husband’s $1.6bn fortune to his son, Pierce Marshall. “She didn’t lose because she was a gold digger,” says Pierce’s lawyer Rusty Hardin. “She lost because of who she was.” Marshall had spent an estimated total of $14m on Smith hoping that it would be enough to support her after his death. On the witness stand, she described expenses “that the average person would find ludicrous”, Hardin adds. “It did not matter if it was alcohol or sex or drugs or food, she was a glutton” Despite Macfarlane’s attempts to portray Smith as a sympathetic character, the rest of the film unfolds as chaotically and cringe-inducingly as it did in real life, from her short-lived reality TV show, to the custody battle over her infant daughter, to the tragedy of her son Daniel’s fatal drug overdose. Without the PR and management infrastructure Marshall had put in place for her, Smith’s career devolved into a series of clownish, visibly drug-addled public appearances. “Throughout her life, she tried to be what she thought other people wanted her to be,” producer Alexandra Lacey says. Consequently, Smith also turned out to be a thoroughly unreliable narrator; her stories of childhood abuse were actually stolen from Missy’s life in order to garner attention and sympathy. The real Anna Nicole Smith is a figure of many contradictions, says Macfarlane, “and we’re grateful to have had the time and the space to dig down and pull out all the nuances of someone who is extremely complex”. While her film presents few revelations about its subject, the director values the opportunity to revisit the tabloid era of the 90s “with fresh eyes”. “If [Smith] were forging her narrative today, I really like think that she’d be living a joyous social media life where she was in control of the narrative,” Macfarlane says. “In the post-#MeToo world, I want people watching this film to come away with more empathy and less judgment.” Anna Nicole: You Don’t Know Me is now available on Netflix</body>

    <head>Greggs wins right to late-night opening for Leicester Square bakery store</head>
    <body>A heated debate over Greggs’ right to trade into the early hours in central London, amid warnings it could cause a wave of crime and disorder, has been resolved. Greggs said it could now open its Leicester Square flagship store until 2am from Thursday to Saturday and until midnight through the rest of the week after Westminster council allowed it to sell hot drinks, such as tea and coffee, as well as its sausage rolls, pizza slices and steak bakes, after an 11pm curfew. Greggs said it had cancelled a three-day appeal hearing planned to start on Tuesday after reaching the agreement – although it falls short of its hopes of 24-hour trading. The store will also not be allowed to sell food heated above ambient temperature, including potato wedges and chicken goujons, past 11pm, under a licence expected to be approved later this week. The company was last summer refused a licence to open its store in Leicester Square between 11pm and 5am amid claims it could become a “hotspot for late-night disturbances and antisocial behaviour”. Aicha Less, a councillor and the deputy leader of Westminster city council, said: “Greggs had originally applied for a licence in Leicester Square to sell hot food and hot drinks for 24 hours, Mondays to Sundays. This was refused by Westminster’s licensing subcommittee and Greggs appealed that decision. “Based on the merits of this case, Westminster have come to an agreement with Greggs that works for everyone.” The council said Greggs’ licence covered the sale of hot drinks, but not food kept hot, and was based on “significant conditions”, including the installation of CCTV at its store, the use of door supervisors and litter clearance. Related: 24-hour sausage rolls: will they lead to a wave of crime and disorder? Roisin Currie, the chief executive of Greggs, said the appeal had been cancelled because discussions with Westminster had “reached a good solution for both parties”. She said Greggs would not trade 24 hours a day but would be able to open “over the midnight cusp”. Greggs does not need a licence to sell its sausage rolls and other bakes as they are made elsewhere and not kept hot in-store, and are allowed to cool down once baked. However, it needs special permission from the local authority to sell hot food, including bacon baps, sausage breakfast rolls, chicken goujons and potato wedges, which are kept hot once cooked, as well as tea and coffee, between 11pm and 5am. Greggs has previously said it chose not to open after 11pm until reaching the new agreement as customers could be confused if its full menu was not available. Nearby competitors, including McDonald’s, are able to sell hot food into the early hours. Greggs’ application for late-night trading was blocked by Westminster council after the Metropolitan police said fast-food premises operating after 11pm attracted those who had been drinking in pubs and bars nearby, with “the likely effect of an increase in crime and disorder in the area and an increased demand on police resources which are already stretched”. Police said the fact that the outlet did not have seating would add to problems with dispersing crowds from around Leicester Square’s gardens. Greggs revealed a 17% rise in underlying sales in the 19 weeks to 13 May. The company said sales of hot food were showing particularly strong growth, with evenings being the fastest-growing sales period. Currie said Greggs was working hard to keep a lid on price rises as it had fixed the cost of energy and packaging for several months. She added that inflation continued to have an impact, with labour and commodity prices rising, and she expected costs to rise by up to 10% in the year ahead. • This article was amended on 16 May 2023. An earlier version said Greggs could sell hot food at its Leicester Square branch until 2am. To clarify, Greggs can sell hot drinks until 2am Thursday to Saturday and until midnight on other days. It can sell sausage rolls and steak bakes at any time as these items are allowed to cool in store, but it cannot sell potato wedges and chicken goujons, and other items which are kept hot, beyond 11pm.</body>

    <head>Ursula von der Leyen steps up calls for tribunal for Russia’s ‘crime of aggression’</head>
    <body>The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, is stepping up calls for a special tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression. Speaking ahead of a summit of European leaders in Reykjavik on Tuesday, Von der Leyen said “accountability of Russia for the crime of aggression” would be a big topic. Earlier this week, she promised to “strongly support the creation of a dedicated tribunal to bring Russia’s crime of aggression to trial”. Leaders from across the continent are meeting in the Icelandic capital for a Council of Europe summit, only the fourth in the body’s 74-year history. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Olaf Scholz, Emmanuel Macron, Rishi Sunak and Von der Leyen are to give speeches later on Tuesday. Russia was expelled from the Council of Europe last March after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Moscow had announced its intention to withdraw from the continent’s leading human rights body the day before its expulsion, after the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly called for its withdrawal. Ukraine, backed by the European Commission and several member states, has led calls for a special tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his top officials for the crime of aggression. The commission last year set out two options to hold Putin to account: an international tribunal based on a multilateral treaty or a special hybrid court integrated into a national justice system with international judges. EU officials think both options would require UN support and hope to win backing in the general assembly, recognising that Russia – a veto-wielding member of the security council – would block any such idea. The international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Putin and other senior Russian officials over the abduction of Ukrainian children. But it does not have the power to try crimes of aggression, as Russia has not ratified the ICC treaty. Supporters of a special tribunal argue that it needs to be set up urgently while the war rages, arguing it could have a cooling effect on atrocities committed by invading forces. Speaking on Tuesday, Von der Leyen said leaders would also decide on setting up “a register of damage in The Hague”, which she described as “a first step towards Russian compensation”. The bill for rebuilding Ukraine has grown to $411bn (£329bn), the World Bank said in March, based on one year’s worth of devastation wrought by the Russian invasion. Von der Leyen said the register of damages would be “an enormously important judicial element … to give justice to the victims”. The commission has also promised to help create an international centre to gather and store evidence on the crime of aggression and said such a body would be set up in The Hague and operational from July.</body>

    <head>Imran Khan granted bail in more cases relating to corruption charges</head>
    <body>Pakistan’s former prime minister Imran Khan has been granted bail in several more cases as he continues to allege that the country’s powerful military plans to rearrest him imminently. Khan, who is facing more than 100 cases, was granted bail by courts in Islamabad and Lahore in several cases relating to corruption and terrorism charges. Khan’s lawyers also appeared before the Lahore high court, alleging that several “secret cases” had been filed against Khan they had not been informed about, and sought bail for all cases filed in the past two weeks. The court has reserved its judgment until later in the week. Khan did not appear before the court in Lahore, leading to questions from the judge about his whereabouts. The previous day, his wife Bushra Bibi had been granted bail in a corruption case, after Khan alleged in a series of tweets that the military planned to arrest her as part of plan to “humiliate” him. Since Khan was released from jail last Friday, after his arrest earlier in the week had been declared illegal by the supreme court, the political turmoil in Pakistan has showed no sign of relenting. In recent days, Khan escalated his attacks on Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, in particular its most senior generals. In an interview, Khan had openly accused the head of the military of having a “personal grudge” against him and being behind his arrest. And in a series of tweets this week, he alleged that the military planned to lock him away “for 10 years” by charging him with sedition. “This is a deliberate attempt to instil so much fear in people that when they come to arrest me tomorrow, people won’t come out,” he said in the tweet. In a follow-up video message broadcast on Twitter on Tuesday, Khan, a populist with massive public support, reiterated his call for his followers to take to the streets and hold peaceful protests when he gave the command. “When the nation decides that it won’t tolerate this oppression, when it decides that it won’t allow the violation of the constitution and that it wants elections – then no one will be able to stop them,” said Khan in his broadcast. Meanwhile, hundreds of supporters of the ruling coalition government had gathered in their own protest on Monday outside the supreme court, accusing the chief justice who had declared Khan’s arrest illegal as being “biased” and giving “undue favours” to Khan. The crackdown on members of Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) continued on Tuesday, with two senior leaders rearrested just hours after the court granted them bail. PTI leader, Fawad Chaudhry, sprinted back into Islamabad high court for protection after he found dozens of police waiting to arrest him after he was granted bail. Another senior figure in the party was remanded by an anti-terrorism court, relating to the violent protests that took place after Khan was arrested. However, some in Khan’s party appeared rattled by his vehement anti-military rhetoric, which is unprecedented in a country where the power of the military is seen as absolute. ‘“We can change political parties but we cannot change our army. I have never gone against the army nor will I do it in the future,” said a former PTI minister Mahmood Baqi in a press conference announcing he was leaving the party. The government and military also stepped up their rhetoric against those who had carried out violence during protests across Pakistan last week, accusing Khan and PTI members of conspiring to stir up the attacks. The prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, addressed a meeting of the country’s national security committee on Tuesday, stating: “I believe that whoever planned this and incited the vandalism, they are certainly guilty of terrorism.” Controversially, the army announced their intention to charge civilians who had taken part in violent attacks on military and government buildings under the Pakistan Army Act, which is usually reserved for those in the military. It was condemned by one politician from the ruling coalition as a “dangerous move” while Amnesty’s deputy regional director for South Asia, Dinushika Dissanayake, called it “alarming” and warned that “trying civilians in military courts is contrary to international law.”.</body>

    <head>Rory McIlroy plans to stay silent on LIV and focus on US PGA performance</head>
    <body>Rory McIlroy has promised a vow of silence on matters attached to LIV Golf, with the Northern Irishman determined to focus fully on his own performance for the remainder of 2023. McIlroy’s position at the forefront of the PGA Tour’s resistance to the rebel LIV tour has seen him questioned continually regarding off‑course matters. Speaking at Oak Hill, where he hopes to win a third US PGA Championship, he was curt when the likely future of LIV was put to him. Related: Emotional Jason Day breaks five-year PGA Tour drought with Mother’s Day victory “I don’t have a crystal ball,” he said. He followed up with a firm “no” when asked whether he would care to speculate and an equally direct “yes” over whether sidestepping the LIV storyline was a deliberate effort. “I would rather people be talking about me for my golf rather than stuff that I am doing behind the scenes or what I have said in a press conference. “I don’t regret anything that I have done because I think what has been done is really helpful and will help the guys that are on tour right now and help the next generation of players hopefully have a better professional tour to play on and all that sort of stuff. I think the work that has been done has been really good. “But now that the wheels have been set in motion it is time to focus on me and focus on playing great golf and trying to get back to winning ways.” McIlroy’s missed cut last month at the Masters came as a shock, including to the man himself. The four-time major winner, 34, had looked in fine spirits before the tournament. His wait to complete what would be a grand slam of major titles goes on. Rory McIlroy missed the cut at the 2023 Masters, much to everyone’s surprise.

It was a great lesson for me to not put too much into feelings or vibes. I shot five under on the back nine on the Wednesday afternoon and felt great. Everything was in a good spot. I had a chat with [the sports psychologist] Bob Rotella that night and said: ‘I feel so good. Like, how can I not get ahead of myself?’ “But that’s golf. Golf can be an impostor at times and the game can bring you back down to earth pretty quickly. I think the best way to deal with that is to not let yourself get to that level of expectation so early. That’s sort of what I’m trying to do, just trying to take what the golf course gives me and hit good golf shots. “Just try to have a little more acceptance. If I think back to Augusta, maybe over the last few months as well, my level of acceptance probably hasn’t been where it needs to be. If I work on that, and I do the right things, then I know I’ll start to play some really good golf again pretty quickly.”</body>

    <head>‘I’m not overthinking’: Guardiola gears up for City’s duel with Real Madrid</head>
    <body>Pep Guardiola has promised he will not overthink Manchester City’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid on Wednesday. The manager said his legacy is already exceptional and will not be defined by whether he wins the competition with the club. The tie is poised at 1-1 after the opening leg at the Santiago Bernabéu last week. Guardiola has been viewed as causing City’s defeat in previous editions of the Champions League by overcomplicating selection and tactics. The most prominent example was the 1-0 defeat against Chelsea in the 2021 final when he dropped Rodri and João Cancelo, did not play a regular holding player and reinstated the out‑of‑favour Raheem Sterling. Related: How Barcelona won La Liga: the story behind success for a new era | Sid Lowe Guardiola believes City have to perform better than they did against Real in Spain but he was reluctant to reveal how he will accomplish this. “Hopefully you can see tomorrow,” he said. “Nothing special. I’m not overthinking, don’t worry guys, nothing different to what we’ve done, just more fluid and play a bit better. “The emotion is there and has to be high, but just this won’t beat a team like Madrid. We have to adjust something, do it a little better to create chances for our strikers and people up front to get more balls, transitions, the quality they have in all departments.” In six previous attempts Guardiola has failed to lead City to the trophy, though his tenure is supremely successful. The champions require a maximum of one Premier League win for a hat-trick of titles and the fifth under Guardiola, who has also claimed the FA Cup and four League Cups. As City are in the FA Cup final next month they remain on course for the treble. Guardiola referred to his record when asked whether the Champions League was needed to firm up his legacy. “The legacy is that we’ve had [one hell of a time] here and for many years they will remember a generation of players who for five or six years scored lots of goals and conceded very few and that we won lots of things and won very well and people should remember that,” he said. “Whether or not they will remember us or not I don’t know, but we have had a good time. “My legacy is already exceptional. We are not stupid to know how important it is [the Real match]: one of the most important, the competition, the rival. I’ve told the players to enjoy the moment. We are incredibly lucky to be here, it’s in our hands.” Guardiola, who has only Nathan Aké injured, said he would take a repeat of the 4-3 victory against Real last year in what was the first leg of that semi-final. “We’d like to have the game we had last season – I’d sign for it right now. But I don’t think it will happen. Sometimes the game dictates [its pattern]: how you lose the ball, the ball in certain moments, how you react. “This competition has a lot of uncertain things; we will see. I’ve a plan, we’ll try to execute it and try to adapt to what they do.” Carlo Ancelotti, who guided Real to their 14th triumph in the competition last season, said he would have mixed emotions before the match. “Today I’m very calm, full of hope and faith. Tomorrow – game day – that’s when the worries come in and you think things through. Whether [Erling] Haaland will score, if Kevin De Bruyne will hurt you, but you try to put it out of your mind. “It’s all about managing thoughts. We are very happy to be here, we are feeling good – enjoy it while we can. The [difficult] thoughts can come tomorrow. We will need bravery, courage – this is vital in games like this. Individual quality can’t show if you aren’t brave enough to try stuff.”</body>

    <head>F1 paddock evacuated as Emilia Romagna GP hit by severe weather</head>
    <body>The Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola is under threat after severe weather hit the region and caused the evacuation of the paddock on Tuesday, while further heavy rain is expected on Thursday and there are fears the adjacent river may burst its banks. Formula One took the precaution with the possibility of flooding affecting the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari over a two-day period during which authorities issued a red alert for Tuesday and Wednesday of flooding and landslides in the Emilia Romagna region. F1 is monitoring the situation and remains optimistic that the race will go ahead this weekend as planned. Related: Ferrari must embrace Leclerc’s risk-taking with F1 title gone and car a mess | Giles Richards The region was already hit two weeks ago by severe weather, which caused two fatalities, and the forecast is for it to continue all this week, with thunderstorms forecast for Saturday and Sunday. Teams had already arrived at the track to begin their build for the weekend, with Tuesday the principal day used for assembling their garages, equipment, motor homes and hospitality. After the weather warning was issued they continued to do so until the race promoter and authorities asked them to leave as a precaution, which was carried out in a calm and orderly fashion. The circuit is flanked by the Santerno River which runs parallel to the paddock. F1 has insisted the river banks have not been breached but it is being monitored, with very high water levels. Videos of it on social media showed the broad and fast-flowing waterway running exceptionally high and that there was some water accumulating in the paddock and track area. The FIA is also monitoring the situation to ensure the safety of all F1 personnel. The expectation is the rain will abate somewhat before this weekend’s race but further heavy rain is forecast for Wednesday, with warnings of between 100mm and 150mm. Conditions on the race weekend are understood to not be of a concern but rather the issues that could affect the circuit from significant flooding before then, particularly if the river level rises further. More than 120,000 fans are expected to attend this weekend but for the moment the National Crisis Unit in Italy, which has warned of up to 150mm of rain on Wednesday, has already urged people to remain at home because of the risks the severe weather posed. “In the areas affected by the red alert, the mayors could foresee, for tomorrow, the closure of schools and roads most at risk, starting from those near the banks and landslide areas,” it warned. “The invitation to citizens is to avoid travel as much as possible and to resort, where possible, to smart working.”</body>

    <head>Vodafone’s new boss still needs to dial up radicalism</head>
    <body>It is remarkable that a company, even one as big as Vodafone, can announce 11,000 job cuts over three years but also say that no net cost savings will flow to the bottom line. A notional €250m (£220m) gain will be consumed entirely by reinvestment. Such is life in the world of European big telecoms – there are few simple wins. The point about Vodafone, however, is that its financial performance is worse than most of its peers. “Our performance has not been good enough,” said the new chief executive, Margherita Della Valle, on Tuesday, telling shareholders what they knew already. The share price, down 7% on Tuesday, has more than halved over the past five years. As the former finance director, Della Valle was the insider candidate for the top job, and thus not everybody’s idea of a fresh start. One can, though, say this in her favour: in the plain-speaking department, she’s an upgrade on her predecessor Nick Read. Related: Vodafone to cut 11,000 jobs worldwide over next three years Whereas Read seemed perpetually to be making excuses for setbacks (to the point where even Vodafone’s traditionally indolent board was obliged to act), Della Valle is free to admit that the approach over the last few years has been “too incremental” and the company has baffled itself with internal complexity. The cock-up in Germany, which ultimately cost Read his job, owed much to the failure both of head office in Paddington and management on the ground to recognise the significance of an unbundling change in local consumer law. Fleeter-footed rivals seized the opportunity to grab a share in Vodafone’s biggest market (30% of group revenues). So, yes, Della Valle’s prescription for a simpler management structure, a smaller head office and more local accountability sounds correct. Critics have pointed at Vodafone’s bloated centre for years. What, though, of the parallel demand that Vodafone should be simpler in the sense of owning fewer sub-scale operations? That is where the signal from Della Valle became scrambled. In Spain (9% of revenues), where Vodafone was outflanked in the last round of market consolidation, there will be yet another “strategic review”, but there are “no quick fixes”, said Della Valle. In Italy (11%), where Read rejected a deal, the plan seems to be to plough on. Then there’s the UK (14%), where talks with Three about a combo haven’t yet produced a deal. Agreement is still the way to bet, but a key question will be what remedies are demanded by the competition regulator; the answer may not be quick. And, unfortunately for Della Valle, it is only deal-making that is likely to inject life into the share price. Her pledges about improving the quality of customer service are worthy, but investors tend to take such stuff as read. If Vodacom, the African business, is staying, then something structurally big has to happen in one or more of the major European markets to move the dial. The most revealing chart in Della Valle’s presentation was the one about returns on capital. The UK, Italy and Spain were shown as recording returns below the group’s cost of capital and even Germany – where Vodafone is market leader – was just “around” cost of capital levels. That’s a very poor starting position. The dividend was held this time but a 9% yield says the market wonders for how much longer. The presence in the wings (and now on the board) of Emirates Telecommunications Group with a 14.6% stake offers the vague possibility of alternative excitement. Really, though, a turnaround comes down to Della Valle’s ability to secure value-creating deals. If nothing else changes, Vodafone, even with 11,000 fewer workers, will still look like a sprawling conglomerate that is currently valued at a massive discount to the supposed sum of its parts. Nobody would design the structure today. Della Valle deserves the benefit of the doubt on her first big City outing, but the latest fall in the share price can’t be blamed solely on the weak cashflow forecast for this year. Part of it surely reflects a sense that, for all her candour about Vodafone’s performance, investors have yet to discover how radical she’s prepared to be in cutting Vodafone down to coherent size. It’s a tough gig, but shareholders’ mood is for maximum radicalism.</body>

    <head>Young people: is AI affecting your career choices?</head>
    <body>Many workers fear AI could replace them, and with good reason: earlier this year, investment bank Goldman Sachs claimed that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs in US and Europe, though it suggested losses could be offset by the creation of new occupations. We want to hear about how these developments are affecting how young people view their future job prospects. Has it affected your ideas about career paths? Are you concerned about the future of an industry you wanted to pursue? Have you decided to make a change in studies or training because of this? Alternatively, if you feel your job or career path is safe from AI’s trajectory, let us know about why. We are also interested in those who have recently started working and are considering how the future of AI will affect their employment future and career development. Callout</body>

    <head>UK watchdog denies it blocked Microsoft deal on orders of US regulator</head>
    <body>The UK’s competition watchdog has denied acting on the orders of the Federal Trade Commission in the US, as it defended its decision last month to block Microsoft’s $69bn (£55bn) acquisition of the Call of Duty creator Activision Blizzard. Speaking to MPs on the business and trade select committee, Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, said the body only acts on its own assessment of the validity of a merger. “We are absolutely not doing the bidding of other agencies, we undertake our own analysis,” Cardell said. “We have independent panel groups who are responsible for those decisions, and take those responsibilities incredibly seriously.” Cardell was responding to questions from the Conservative MP Bim Afolami, who pushed the chief executive to provide details of the CMA’s communications with the FTC in the run-up to the contentious decision to block the deal. She said a legal agreement allowed the CMA to discuss specifics with the European Commission but that such a waiver was not in place for the FTC, preventing “detailed conversations” in the latter stages of the merger inquiry. On Monday, the European Commission decided to allow the same merger. The FTC has sued in an attempt to block it, throwing the ultimate decision to the courts. “Our standard in the UK is that we have to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that it’s more likely than not that the merger will result in a lessening of competition,” Cardell said. “The standard in the US is a litigation standard, but the analysis is inherently the same; the evidential base will be inherently the same. That’s also true for the European Commission. Our assessment is then subject to judicial review by the competition appeal tribunal in the UK. That is a rigorous process, and we take that incredibly seriously in making sure that our case is well-evidenced.” Cardell and the chair of the CMA, Marcus Bokkerink, both vigorously denied accusations that the decision to block the deal had harmed the UK’s international reputation. “I would challenge the premise that there is an impact on international confidence in doing business in the UK and that the best way that confidence is served is by turning a blind eye to anti-competitive mergers,” Bokkerink said. “I would worry about a perception that the UK would allow anti-competitive mergers to go ahead and restrict competition in markets. “The UK has always encouraged, and it’s the CMA’s duty to support and encourage, open competitive markets. And so all our decisions absolutely are about encouraging and promoting open competitive markets where innovators can flow freely.” Cardell added: “When we’re looking strategically at the role of the competition authority, we will consider the impact of the decisions that we have made and the impact that has for the UK, including the reputation externally. I believe that strong competition is a very positive signal for the UK.”</body>

    <head>Turbocharge philanthropy, conga to Beethoven, ditch the ukuleles: 10 ways to save classical music</head>
    <body>1. Turn off your phone and revel in the mysterious Don’t we all need a bit of time to be alone with our thoughts? Or to sit and share something that requires us to put away our phones and revel in something mysterious, beautiful and visceral? All music can offer us a haven for reflection, but classical music is constructed more like a narrative than a short lyric. You just need to give it time. I find it upsetting that British politicians are afraid of revealing that they’re interested in culture. In Italy, where I conduct the Santa Cecilia Orchestra, the audience applaud when a senior politician comes to a concert. Classical music – and all culture – helps grow our collective awareness of what it is to be a human being. That’s a beautiful thing – why don’t we celebrate it? Conducting at the coronation proved what an extraordinary array of talent we have here in the UK, from gospel choirs to brass bands. How can their existence be so threatened? Music’s value and importance was there for everyone to see. I hope it provokes a real discussion for once. Classical music gets your brain as well as your heart going. How many things in life can do all that? Antonio Pappano, music director of the Royal Opera House. Pappano conducts Wozzeck there from 19 May. 2. The Tories should honour their £90m manifesto pledge I grew up on a north London estate with no interest in classical music. But my life changed at 17 when I was given a ticket to hear a string quartet. I still remember what was played – Beethoven then Brahms (super boring, I thought). But then they played Ligeti’s Métamorphoses Nocturnes, written in the 1950s, a few years after most of his family had been killed in the Holocaust. It’s raw, brutal even, certainly not tuneful, and it completely captivated me. ‘It’s not for me’ has to be turned into ‘I can’t live without this’ I would never have been at that concert if it wasn’t for the Cavatina Chamber Music Trust, a charity that gives young people tickets to concerts. That experience inspired me to go to university to study music and put me on the path to where I am today. Everyone should have access to classical music. It enriches lives in so many ways.But it’s an expensive art form and without support – from charities, government, philanthropists – organisations will not be able to build future audiences, ticket prices will rise and classical music risks becoming the preserve of the few. We need a bigger cultural spend. I’d like to see a better settlement for the BBC and for the Arts Council. The government should supercharge philanthropy to make it much easier for private individuals to support the sector. The last three or four years have been so difficult for the sector; it feels we have a perfect storm today. First the pandemic and then Brexit to contend with, and now high inflation, high energy costs and audiences are still slightly down on pre-pandemic levels. During the Covid crisis, the government’s £2bn rescue package kept many organisations alive. There’s no point in saving the cultural sector only to see it disintegrate now. I’d also like to see the government honour its manifesto promise of a £90m premium for arts education in schools. If young people aren’t exposed to it, classical music has no future.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian 3. Look to Europe and speak about the arts with pride We need to shout more about the excellence and passion of our work. My experience of Europe, at the Bergen Philharmonic, suggests it takes greater pride in cultural establishments. Even people who don’t visit the opera house in their city feel it is theirs. It gives the city strength, identity, a sense of community. Governmentally, the arts should be spoken about with pride and confidence. We now have an entire generation who weren’t offered music as part of their core curriculum. The educational and social benefits of arts education is proven. In my experience, the UK seems to engage with this less than any other European country. No orchestra on its own, hard as we work can make up for this vacuum and we all need music education reinstated as soon as possible. Edward Gardner, principal conductor, London Philharmonic Orchestra and chief conductor, Bergen Philharmonic. Compare the billions Germany and France invest in the arts with our government’s £458.5m contribution. Culture is central to these countries’ psyche but our politicians are cowardly when it comes to promoting homegrown talent.

Young people need to see that musicians are relatable I was lucky growing up. I was surrounded by classical music, and my parents showed my siblings and I different role models of Black excellence. All of it is for you and all of it is possible, my parents said. The most fundamental thing is to inspire people from a young age so they know that that classical music is for everyone. But music is expensive. There needs to be lessons in schools, and the means of allowing people from all backgrounds to experience itYoung people need to see that musicians are relatable. Social media is a great facilitator of that. I do a lot of work in schools: I play and talk and answer questions. Children see that I’m also a human being – and they could do what I do. How these events are marketed also seems to me to be crucial. Organisations need to reach out to different audiences and convince them that all music is for them. You can have a Black musician playing Beethoven and a white musician playing Florence Price, both composers are just as accessible and just as appealing. We grew up playing Bach and Brahms and Schubert and didn’t have any preconceptions that this wasn’t ‘for us’. The emotion in their music, even though it was written hundreds of years ago, can be related to.Isata Kanneh-Mason, pianist ‘Children see I’m also a human being – and they could also do what I do’ … Isata Kanneh Mason. Photograph: Robin Clewley Working alongside more artists of colour in recent years has been an integral part of my development as a musician. Diversity can be a loaded term, and it encompasses socio economic background to sexuality, to gender, race and disability. But essentially it’s just people.I’d like to get to where society is better reflected throughout the industry – music is about the human experience and every human should be able to access and make it. The industry is already doing so much to invite in different communities and work on stories that impact people today, but there is still a need to engage with organisations to enable them to find different creators of different backgrounds. So much of this is down to resource.The changes need to be systemic, backstage as well as on stage. If you have a greater breadth of people on your board, the work you produce is going to change. Matthew Kofi Waldren, conductor and co-founder of Your Turn Collective 5. Rethink the finances to ensure musicians get a fair fee A composer’s life in the UK is hard. For most of us, fees are too low, and organisations are struggling to justify commissioning new work when they’re trying to stay afloat. It’s increasingly rare to find young composers from working-class and diverse backgrounds. The destruction of music education in our state schools, BBC job cuts, ACE’s funding cuts (disproportionately affecting new music), and the general undermining of the arts make the dream of a career in music seem unattainable. We need people in classical music from all walks of life but we shut them out due to their lack of financial privilege. Musical organisations need to focus their energies on sourcing co-commissioners to fund their projects, spreading the financial responsibility of the commission, ensuring a fair fee for the composer and guaranteeing repeat performances. Who wants to live in a world where the only composers are those whose parents can pay their rent? Gavin Higgins, composer 6. Nurture the grassroots, from choirs to brass bands ‘Music is a living, breathing art form’ – Jess Gillam with Manchester Camerata at the Wigmore Hall. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer Growing up in Cumbria, opportunities to experience live music weren’t ample but I picked up the saxophone at the Barracudas Carnival Arts Centre aged seven and I was hooked. It was a place that embraced anyone who wanted to be part of dance, music or stilt-walking. Music is a living, breathing art form and, often, once experienced never forgotten. Letting young people be the music is often an ideal starting point.As with sport, the ecosystem of our community relies on music being supported at every level – from local choirs and county orchestras to symphony orchestras and brass bands. In a fragmented world, we need these musical spaces to allow communities to come together with a shared mission and so nurture the audiences of tomorrow. Jess Gillam, saxophonist and broadcaster 7. Schools must go beyond the whole-class ukulele craze Sustained investment in schools is at the heart of this, but it’s also about upending the entrenched disparagement of classical music in wider society. “It’s not for me” has to be turned into “I can’t live without this”. This has to happen from the earliest school years. There should be free or inexpensive instrument tuition beyond the whole-class ukulele craze (a dead-end for populating orchestras of the future). ‘Letting young people be the music is an ideal starting point.’ Photograph: Jeffrey Isaac Greenberg 9+/Alamy There should be regular encounters with exceptional live performance both in schools and off site, crucially with affordable school-to-venue transport. And a massive upscaling of things like the once well-funded national Sing Up programme. We should train all early years teachers to be confident meshing music into the curriculum – teaching them to play the piano, for the leading of class singing, would be transformational. Meurig Bowen, chief executive/artistic director, Britten Sinfonia 8. Do a conga to Beethoven’s 7th At Aurora, we’ve found creative concert presentation to be a powerful tool in engaging a broader audience for the orchestral music we love, whether playing among 2,000 people at Printworks nightclub, inviting 100 people to create a giant graphic score during a concert, or playing from memory. At one show, the whole audience formed a spontaneous conga line to the slow movement of Beethoven’s Seventh. Nicholas Collon conducts the Aurora orchestra in Jane Mitchell’s staging of Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantastique. Photograph: Mark Allan The whole industry is engaging with this question: take a look at the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment’s Night Shift series, which sees the orchestra perform informally in pubs; the Budapest Festival Orchestra’s concerts where audiences can sit on beanbags among the orchestra; or theatrical projects such as the Scottish Ensemble’s Goldberg Variations, which saw musicians and dancers share a stage as equals. Jane Mitchell, principal flute and creative director, Aurora Orchestra 9. Escape the elitist shoebox and hit the village hall Ultimately, opera is about the human condition: love, loss, grief, guilt, family. Yet the situation we’re facing now in the UK is that there’s less opera, and potentially less opportunity for companies to take risks. Not everyone is going to want to come to opera, but we need to create an environment where anybody can feel they can. Matthew Kofi Waldren Opera is being forced into an elitist shoebox. It can and should be found in village halls as well as opera houses, but the 30% funding cuts and cultural deficit in education mean that many communities are unable to experience it. If you remove the education, then you don’t get the supply of musicians, and the elitism and discrimination opera is accused of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Singers, too, are suffering. I began my career with the BBC Singers, then worked with Glyndebourne Touring Opera (not able to tour this year because of ACE cuts) and then English National Opera. All these avenues have been destroyed or compromised. In France or Germany, say, opera is not a dirty word. I’m sure not all politicians like pop music or football, yet they are always happy to be associated with those things. Why not classical music? Sarah Connolly The BBC Concert Orchestra playing to an audience of school children at St George’s Hall, Great Yarmouth. Photograph: Si Barber/The Guardian 10. Put it on prime time – after all, The Piano was a hit The reason classical music is seen as a luxury is because it’s not readily available on mainstream media. Channel 4 has just had a surprise hit with The Piano, which obviously connected on a mass level emotionally. We tend to keep the personalities of fine artists on a pedestal as if exposing them to the masses might dilute their magical powers. If Lennie Bernstein could once hold our hand through a piece on primetime TV, why don’t we encourage a more human connection with the artist themselves? Nicky Spence, singer and broadcaster</body>

    <head>Why Labour must heed the clamour for change</head>
    <body>A new New Labour? Is that really the limit of Keir Starmer’s ambition (‘Clause IV on steroids’: Keir Starmer says his Labour must go further than Blair, 12 May)? And what he said in his speech makes me think he’s talking about a new small-c conservative party. The fact that Britain had a massive financial crisis at the end of 13 years of the Blair/Brown governments shows how little was changed. Almost none of the major stupidities of Thatcher’s policies, such as the deregulation of the financial sector which led to that disaster, was changed. They didn’t even stop the sale of council houses, so over a third of those sold are now in the hands of private landlords. A wasted decade. And New Labour’s repeal of clause IV simply paved the way for the sell-off of vital resources, so we are now facing disastrous price rises, made even more disgusting by the fact that many of our energy firms, rail providers, water companies and bus services are in the hands of foreign equivalents of our previous nationally owned suppliers. And, as usual, not even a mention of that more recent Tory stupidity: Brexit. I suppose it’s a step forward for Starmer to recognise the scale of the disaster facing the country, but pussyfooting words and feeble promises won’t even begin to address the changes needed. I despair. David Reed London • Keir Starmer’s promises to reform public services lag behind public opinion, and while he hesitates, the public is increasingly desperate for change. His caution is often attributed to “private polling”, while in the real world electors who have never supported public ownership call for someone to get a grip on the water industry. Such anger is driven by long-running failures by water companies that still distribute excess profits to shareholders. Privatised rail franchises are more unpopular than the publicly owned services they replaced. And the energy market is fragile, with public money being used to stabilise prices for consumers and protect companies from collapsing. Labour knows that it is benefiting from widespread anger at Tory incompetence, so why not be bold in testing the depth of that dissatisfaction by inviting people to support bolder thinking. It’s clear that dissenting Tory MPs have confidence in their answers (Tories demanding grassroots voice deny being a ‘Johnson revivalist group’, 12 May), continuing to believe in a Brexit that has predictably underperformed, and determined to reinstate an ex-leader whose boldness was only outstripped by the scale of his lies. Les Bright Exeter • Keir Starmer is right to consider allowing EU citizens to vote in general elections in the UK (Report, 15 May). But this idea should go further. I am a British citizen resident in Spain, and, having lived here for a lot more than 15 years (the limit for voting imposed on a person with no UK address), cannot vote in UK general elections. Nor, post-Brexit, can I vote (except in municipal elections) in Spain. Starmer could open the debate about how to ensure that people from the UK and EU whose country of residency does not coincide with their citizenship could receive fair representation – for example, by letting them choose where to vote based on nationality or residency. This would make an important statement about the desire of a future British government to work constructively with the EU.

    <head>Retrain MPs to pick fruit and drive lorries</head>
    <body>Suella Braverman’s belief in the transformative magic of Brexit appears to know no bounds (Suella Braverman to rebuff cabinet calls for easing of visa rules, 14 May). Apparently HGV drivers, butchers and fruit-pickers recruited from abroad constitute “low-skilled foreign labour” whereas, thanks to Brexit, Brits trained up to do the same jobs will be part of a “high-skilled, high-waged economy”. Michael Pyke Lichfield, Staffordshire • What a great idea to train more UK fruit-pickers. The home secretary could start in her own back yard and get MPs to ditch their second jobs to take up the training. Even the dimmest should be able to collect a punnet or two. Could John Crace supervise and give regular performance updates? David Duell Durham • Is the move to encourage people to retrain in butchery, truck driving and other essential trades to include those educated at public schools and Oxford? Or will it just be for those equally intelligent people with no family money and connections who go to “ordinary” schools and universities? Joan Friend Oldham, Greater Manchester • The home secretary would have more success recruiting UK-based lorry drivers if the appalling and limited roadside facilities for them were drastically improved. Sam White Lewes, East Sussex • Suella Braverman appalled by culture wars (Suella Braverman rails against ‘experts and elites’ in partisan speech, 15 May)? What next? The pope appalled by religion?

    <head>It’s astounding that period products aren’t properly regulated</head>
    <body>The lack of innovation addressed in your article (Ninety years since the first Tampax, why aren’t there better menstrual products?, 4 May) makes for depressing reading. Not so much in relation to some very innovative products that are available – ie period pants, which can be thrown in the washing machine, and cups – but the fact that they are still largely unregulated. Independent tests have found harmful chemicals in some – a few intentionally added, such as antimicrobials, some not, such as plastics derivatives or PFAS, known as “forever chemicals”. This is largely due to a lack of transparency about what is in these products that we use in one of the most absorbent parts of the human body – and a lack of effective regulation. Fragrance levels in cosmetics have to be listed on packaging yet, incredibly, the same doesn’t apply for period products. At Wen (Women’s Environmental Network), we have been calling for regulation for decades due to concerns about health and the environment. This year, during our Environmenstrual week of action in October, we are demanding a menstrual health, dignity and sustainability action plan from the government to address all the issues around menstruation and period products. We must not keep making the same mistakes with period products, perpetuating old taboos around “sanitising” products with antimicrobials. Progress comes with healthier, safer, more affordable, reusable and sustainable period products that benefit health and the environment.

    <head>After cancer treatment, I too have found my voice</head>
    <body>Joanne Harris’s article (I used to hide behind my hair. But cancer gave me a buzzcut and helped me find my voice, 15 May) resonated profoundly with me. Having been brought up with the same phrase about being seen and not heard, I am now embracing my super-short hairstyle six months after finishing breast cancer treatment. Rather than being diminished by the debilitating effects of the treatments, which linger on, this is an encouragement to finally find my voice. To become that woman who says it as it is, rather than using my antennae to always sense what the other person wants to hear. It is time now to be both seen and heard. Diane Chorley Bath • Nice of Neil Tennant to stick up for AI songwriting (Report, 16 May). When the Pet Shop Boys became popular, I and other music lovers thought everything they did sounded like it was computer-generated and lacked the human musical touch, so maybe his support is not surprising. David Rennie Cardiff • I wholeheartedly agree with Janet Hawkins about the benefits of joining U3A (Letters, 15 May). I joined three years ago, do Spanish and French classes (we meet at the Old Ship pub in Richmond), and have started a junk metal sculpture group – meeting new friends I wouldn’t have had otherwise. David Halley Twickenham, London • Years ago, an elderly neighbour would stand outside her back door at night, chillingly shouting: “Satan! Satan!” It was months before we realised that she owned a black cat (Letters, 15 May). Toby Wood Peterborough, Cambridgeshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    <head>The Times pays damages to lawyer over misleading article</head>
    <body>A leading lawyer has received “substantial” damages and an apology from the Times over a misleading report that claimed she had been censured by her professional regulator. The story, published in November, concerned controversy over Dinah Rose KC representing the Cayman Islands government in opposing same-sex marriage in a case at the privy council. Rose, the president of Oxford’s Magdalen College, faced criticism by LGBTQ+ rights campaigners for taking the case. She countered that it was her professional obligation to accept the case under the “cab rank” rule, but this was disputed in a Times story headlined “Law chiefs rule against Magdalen College head in Caymans gay rights row”, which led to her suing the newspaper and its legal editor, Jonathan Ames. The report quoted the Bar Standards Board (BSB) as having told Colours Caribbean, a campaign group, that Rose’s interpretation of the cab rank rules “might possibly amount to evidence of recklessness” if “taken at its highest”. In a statement read at the high court in central London on Tuesday, Rose’s lawyer William Bennett KC said she had been “shocked and distressed” by the article. “The article reported claims by a gay rights campaign group based in the Cayman Islands that Ms Rose had wrongly claimed that she had been professionally obliged to accept the instructions when in fact she had not,” he said. The BSB issued a public statement the day after the Times article, clarifying its position and apologising to Rose “if this has not been made sufficiently clear”. An apology published in the Times on Tuesday said: “We accept that under the constitutional principles which she [Rose] cited, the bar rules did not allow her to refuse a brief for the Cayman Islands government in a case concerning the right to same-sex marriage. The article was therefore misleading. We apologise to Ms Rose for the distress caused, and have agreed to pay her substantial damages and legal costs.”</body>

    <head>Roger Ailes’s widow says Murdochs have ‘wreaked havoc’ on Fox News</head>
    <body>Rupert Murdoch’s family has “wreaked havoc” on Fox News, said the widow of Roger Ailes, the network’s former chief executive, adding that the 92-year-old media baron would “never come close” to her late husband’s “genius”. Ailes died on 18 May 2017 at the age of 77. The former Republican operative built Fox News into a rightwing media giant but died less than a year after he was forced out over allegations of extensive sexual harassment. Related: Tucker Carlson says Roger Ailes would ‘never have put up’ with liberal attack on Fox News On Monday his widow, Elizabeth Ailes, a former producer and executive at NBC, issued a tweet to mark what would have been his 83rd birthday. “Happy Heavenly Birthday Roger Ailes,” she wrote. “It took you 20 years to build Fox News into the powerhouse that it was and only six years for the Murdochs to wreak havoc. Rupert thought he could do your job. What a joke. He has the checkbook but could never come close to your genius. RIP.” Rupert Murdoch’s chequebook has been strained of late. Fox agreed to pay $787.5m to settle a $1.6bn defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the broadcast of Donald Trump’s lies about voter fraud in his 2020 presidential election defeat. The network faces other potentially costly lawsuits. Another voting machine company, Smartmatic, has lodged a $2.7bn defamation suit, which Fox has called “a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs”. Another defamation suit was filed by Nina Jankowicz, a former head of a federal government group meant to combat misinformation. Last week, Fox reported a $54m loss for the first three months of the year. Elizabeth Ailes spoke to the Daily Beast after her tweet on Monday. “Roger never had his hand off the wheel when it came to Fox,” she said, adding that the Murdoch family, from Australia, “weren’t born here and don’t have the same pedigree”. She also mocked Rupert Murdoch’s sons, saying her husband used to call James and Lachlan Murdoch “Tweedle Dumb” and “Tweedle Dumber”. Of Lachlan Murdoch, the chief executive of his father’s News Corp, Ailes said: “I was told he’s a spear fisherman – I don’t know if he spends time in the office.” Ailes likened her husband’s fate to that of other big names at Fox News, saying the Murdochs “figured out how to chop off his head”. “That’s what the Murdochs did to Roger,” she told the Daily Beast, “Bill O’Reilly, Eric Bolling, and they did it to Tucker.” Bill O’Reilly and Eric Bolling were hosts forced out over alleged sexual misconduct. Tucker Carlson was the top-rated primetime host until he was fired in the aftermath of the Dominion settlement. The reason for Carlson’s firing remains unknown. Among Fox’s legal difficulties is a suit from Abby Grossberg, a former producer who alleges a hostile and misogynistic working environment, claims Fox has called “unmeritorious” and “riddled with false allegations”. In video leaked last week, referring to liberal attacks on Fox News, Carlson said Roger Ailes “would never put up with this shit”. Carlson has also said he now plans to broadcast on Twitter. Fox News did not comment on Elizabeth Ailes’s remarks. When Ailes died, Rupert Murdoch called him a “brilliant broadcaster”. He also said: “Roger and I shared a big idea which he executed in a way no one else could have. In addition, Roger was a great patriot who never ceased fighting for his beliefs … We will always be enormously grateful for the great business he built. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Elizabeth, and son, Zachary.” Elizabeth Ailes told the Beast: “As one empire falls, maybe another will rise.”</body>

    <head>Lawyers welcome naming of Tory donor in money-laundering case</head>
    <body>Media lawyers have described the high court’s decision to permit the naming of a Conservative donor in a global money-laundering case involving a business associate as a boost for open justice. Javad Marandi, who donated more than £663,800 to the Tories between 2014 and 2020, fought a lengthy legal battle with the BBC to remain anonymous in a claim for forfeiture of assets brought by the National Crime Agency (NCA) against three other individuals. Marandi has denied any wrongdoing and in October 2021 his lawyers were initially successful in obtaining an anonymity order in the forfeiture proceedings. However, in May 2022 a district judge ruled that Marandi could be named, and in March the high court affirmed that decision, lifting the anonymity order. Mr Justice Mostyn, sitting with Lord Justice Warby, said the lower court judge had correctly balanced “on the one hand the core constitutional principle of open justice against, on the other, the potential damage to the claimant’s private and family life”. He said his “only surprise” was that the order was granted in the first place, given “procedural unfairness as well as a distinct lack of merit”. Mark Stephens, a partner at Howard Kennedy, said: “I think fair to say that this is a good reminder to all judges that the open justice principle is one of the basic tenets on which our justice system is founded. These kinds of orders, which in this case has been demonstrated to be inappropriate, are clearly being dished out too lavishly.” Stephens, a trustee of Index on Censorship, said there had been an increase in anonymity order claims by the rich and powerful, who often employed expert lawyers against opponents, “so this is a decision which is very much to be welcomed and puts things back on a sort of even keel”. A judgment in February last year ordered that family members of Javanshir Feyziyev, a multimillionaire Azerbaijani politician, forfeit £5.63m of suspicious funds brought into the UK via a complex money-laundering scheme nicknamed the “Azerbaijani laundromat”. It found that $37m (£30m) from the Azerbaijan laundromat was paid into the Latvian bank account of Avromed Company (Seychelles), a business of which Marandi was a beneficiary. The NCA’s case, accepted by the judge, was that Avromed Company (Seychelles) was being used to launder the proceeds of crime. Stephens said: “There’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t know about the findings of the judge. And in fact, arguably, people who are undertaking business with him [Marandi] have an interest in knowing about it.” Persephone Bridgman Baker, a partner at Carter-Ruck, said: “The judgment emphasises the importance of open justice and the strict requirements for any derogation: the criticism made by one judge was that the way in which Mr Marandi issued his application appeared to be ‘a strategic decision to give almost the shortest possible notice to the NCA, and in reality none to the press, [so] that the application for the RRO (reporting restriction order) was effectively uncontested’. “The judgment is a stark reminder about what is required to successfully ask a court to derogate from open justice.” A statement on behalf of Marandi’s lawyers said he “vehemently denies any wrongdoing”, adding: “At no point has Mr Marandi been investigated or questioned by the authorities … Mr Marandi is deeply disappointed at the court’s decision to lift reporting restrictions, knowing the reputational damage that is likely to follow.”</body>

    <head>The sound of VAR: like listening to Cape Canaveral during a space launch</head>
    <body>AND IT’S LIVE So this was VAR. The great Satan of football, the Deep Thought supercomputer belching out erroneous football decisions like ChatGPT attempting to write William Burroughs’ Naked Lunch with added Greater Manchester bias, finally had its curtain pulled up. The sound of VAR, as revealed by a smart casual (black, natch) Howard Webb on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football, is a group of earnest blokes chatting about football. At high-speed, commentating on each possible contravention of the laws like Martin Tyler on a crystal meth jag, and all at once. In the style of close working relationships, everyone has a nickname. At Stockley Park, Baz, Kaz, Łaz, Trev, Bev, Kav, Ledge, Hayesey, Maisie, Daisy and Titch chunter together through incident after incident, down the earhole of a mic-ed up ref and his assistants. It looked and sounded chaotic, especially when players and managers start trying to referee the games themselves. Oleksandr Zinchenko, we all saw you, claiming offside when you had played Kieran Trippier on, caught red-handed and red-faced during the extended dissection of a Jakub Kiwior handball at Newcastle that never was. Related: PFA seeks advice on legal protections for players during pitch invasions Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher were the audience on Monday, the latter’s brow furrowed deeper than the Mersey tunnel as someone whose run-ins with officialdom almost certainly still rankle. The effect was like listening to Cape Canaveral during a space shuttle launch, disembodied voices over TV pictures, except with mostly northern English accents, give or take Australian Jarred Gillett: Jazza/Gilly, if you flamin’ will. For the tinfoil crew to chew on, there was the odd tinge of Manc, though the more pertinent question might be why southern county associations don’t produce enough refs these days, rather than blaming the World Economic Forum, Lord Ferg, Mick Hucknall and the BBC setting up shop in Salford for that. Webb himself pointed out that officiating involves “a whole swathe of subjective decisions”, highlighting why refs can never satisfy everyone. Then there was the drawing of lines for offside, which looked a bit complicated. Webb also admitted that on occasion, pictures can be sequenced at the wrong time, leading to decisions like Ivan Toney’s penalty against Bournemouth being awarded despite him committing a foul seconds before. Human error, then, just what VAR was supposed to prevent but cannot as it is a very human process. “Fans need to see this,” howled Neville. More regular expositions are likely from next season. “We can’t play it live within the laws of the game,” sighed Webb, Fifa preventing that. A useful exercise, definitely, but one unlikely to have changed many opinions, since what VAR can never stop is people believing what they want to believe.

    <head>Man and woman killed in suspected knife attack in Huddersfield named by police</head>
    <body>A man and a woman killed in a suspected knife attack in Huddersfield have been named by police. West Yorkshire police said the two victims were Katie Higton, 27, and Steven Harnett, 25, from Huddersfield. Higton was a mother of four children and Harnett was reportedly her new boyfriend. A 34-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of double murder and remains in police custody. Police were called to a house in the Dalton area of Huddersfield at 9.53am on Monday after paramedics found Higton and Hartnett, who had suffered multiple injuries and had died at the scene. Postmortems are yet to be conducted but both victims received injuries believed to have been inflicted by a bladed weapon, police said. On Tuesday a heavy police presence and cordons remained at the scene of the suspected double murder on Harpe Inge, the residential street in question. The former brother- and sister-in-law of Higton paid tribute to her as “the best mum” and said the family was “absolutely devastated” as they placed flowers on behalf of her two eldest children at the scene. Her former brother-in-law, who asked not to be named, said his brother had been in a relationship with Higton for seven years and was the father of her two oldest children, daughters aged nine and 10. He told the PA news agency the children “were in the property when the incident took place”. He described Higton as “bubbly, outgoing, fun” and “a great mum”. A resident from the street behind Harpe Inge said: “I knew it was serious, with the air ambulance and the forensics. They were out all day.” A card left with flowers at the scene said: “RIP my darling. We love you. No more suffering.” Another said: “I am so sorry for how things have ended.” Scott I’Anson, who lives on Harpe Inge, said he did not know the woman who lived in the house but had seen her and her children. “They kept to themselves but a lot of people liked them,” he said. “It’s quite a big family street. I knew she had a partner but I never met him.” Specially trained officers are supporting their families, police said, with officers conducting patrols in the local area to reassure residents. Det Supt Marc Bowes of the force’s homicide and major enquiry team, said: “This has clearly been an exceptionally serious offence and I can promise residents that a full investigation is ongoing into the murder of this man and woman. “We are conducting extensive inquiries at the scene and at other locations in the Dalton area as we investigate the circumstances of what took place. He added: “I am appealing for anyone who saw suspicious activity overnight or this morning at the property on Harpe Inge to contact us. “Residents in the nearby area will also note an increased police presence on their streets and I want to reassure them and the wider community we are doing all we can to bring persons responsible for this offence to justice.” Police asked anyone with information to contact the homicide and major inquiry team on 101 referencing police log 408 of 15 May, or to contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.</body>

In London, the FTSE 100 index is down 31 points or 0.4% at 7746. The blue-chip index is being dragged down by Vodafone, which has now lost over 8% today after announcing 11,000 job cuts this morning. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC are down around 0.2%. Investors have noted warnings from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen today that a default on government debt would likely leave millions of Americans without income payments, potentially triggering a recession that could destroy many American jobs and businesses. Yellen told a gathering of community bankers that the unprecedented economic and financial crisis would be exacerbated by possible disruptions to the federal government’s operations, including air traffic control, law enforcement, border security and national defense, and telecommunications systems. The accompanying financial crisis could multiply the severity of the downturn, she said in remarks prepared for delivery, adding, “It is very conceivable that we’d see a number of financial markets break - with worldwide panic triggering margin calls, runs and fire sales.” Yellen also warned: “Our economy would suddenly find itself in an unprecedented economic and financial storm…. And the resulting income shock could lead to a recession that destroys many American jobs and businesses. Updated at 3.59pm BST 3.36pm BST Lebanon&apos;s Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh at a news conference in 2019. Photograph: Mohamed Azakir/Reuters Reuters are reporting that French prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for the central bank governor of Lebanon, Riad Salameh. This dramatic move comes after Salameh failed to attend a hearing in Paris today, they say. AFP report that Salameh was due to be questioned on corruption charges, adding: A European judicial team from France, Germany and Luxembourg is conducting a corruption probe into an array of financial crimes, including illicit enrichment and alleged laundering of $330m, implicating the Lebanese governor, Riad Salameh. Salameh, 72, who has held his post for almost 30 years, has repeatedly denied all allegations against him. He has insisted that his wealth comes from his previous job as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch, inherited properties, and investments. The three European governments in March 2022 froze over $130m in assets linked to the probe. During a visit to Lebanon in March, the European delegation questioned Salameh about the Lebanese central bank’s assets and investments outside the country, a Paris apartment — which the governor owns— and his brother Raja Salameh’s brokerage firm Forry Associates Ltd. According to a senior Lebanese judicial official, Riad Salameh never received his summons from Paris despite several attempts to deliver it. The official said a Lebanese judge sent the notice to Salameh several times over the past two weeks, but it was returned each time because the governor was not present at the central bank to receive the notice.

Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told a conference in Dublin today that she does not think the US central bank is at a point yet where it can hold interest rates steady for a period of time, given how stubborn inflation is. Mester said: “The approach I’m taking is that I would like the policy rate to get to a point where, when I’m thinking about what would the next policy change be, I want it to be equally a potential increase versus a decrease.” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic made similar comments on Monday, saying that he would lean towards another rise in borrowing costs, not a cut.

The broader S&amp;P 500 has lost 0.2%, with the tech-focused Nasdaq down 0.1%. Home Depot is leading the fallers on the Dow, down 3.7%, after the DIY chain cut its annual sales forecast and projected a steeper decline in profit than previously expected today. Home Depot warned that demand for tools and building materials was weakening as inflation-wary Americans cut back on spending, such as on home improvement. Traders are also hoping to see signs of progress over the US debt ceiling today. Democratic President Joe Biden and top congressional Republican Kevin McCarthy are due to hold talks over how to raise the U.S. government’s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling and avert an economically catastrophic default. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has warned today that the US economy’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic would be undone and a new financial crisis would be triggered if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, leading to a default.

US industrial production rose 0.5% in April, after flatlining for the previous two months. In April, manufacturing increased 1.0%, driven by higher output of motor vehicles and parts. The index for mining rose 0.6 percent, while the index for utilities dropped 3.1 percent, as milder temperatures in April lowered demand for heating.

The Canadian consumer prices index rose by 4.4% in the year to April, up from 4.3% in the year to March, lifted by highe rent prices and mortgage interest costs. This was the first acceleration in headline consumer inflation since June 2022. The annual inflation rate in Canada rose to 4.4% in April of 2023 from the 19-month low of 4.3% in the previous month, well above expectations of 4.1% to halt the 10-month streak of slower inflation. pic.twitter.com/krwn06NhlO — Bertin Balouki SIMYELI (@B_bakouki) May 16, 2023 It looks like there&apos;s been a bump in the road in the Bank of Canada&apos;s ongoing fight against inflation. https://t.co/Yldf2tye5K — BNN Bloomberg (@BNNBloomberg) May 16, 2023 Gasoline prices rose by 6.3% in April compared with March, the largest monthly increase since October 2022, after the Opec group cut its output at the start of April, driving up crude prices.

Huntet adds: That said, with the April gain coming after two months of declines, real consumption growth is still likely to slow quite sharply in the second quarter. 1.42pm BST US retail sales miss expectations US consumer spending was weaker than forecast last month, new economic data shows. US retail sales rose by 0.4% in April, missing forecasts of a 0.8% rise, after a 0.7% drop in March. Online spending (at non-store retailers) rose 1.2% month-on-month, and was 0.9% higher at health and personal care stores. But spending deteriorated at furniture and home furnishing outlets (down 0.7%), and at electronics and appliance stores (-0.5%) and at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores (-3.3%).

Tighter financial conditions and the energy price shock have begun to weigh on near-term growth, the IMF warned in its country report for Germany. It forecast growth in Germany’s gross domestic product (GDP) to stay near zero in 2023, before gradually strengthening to between 1% and 2% in the period of 2024 to 2026. Over the longer term, average GDP growth is expected to fall back below 1% as the population ages and with no significant accelerations in productivity or labour supply foreseen. Although headline inflation is falling steadily, core inflation is proving stickier, according to the report, which warned: “A top priority in the near term is thus to support disinflation with a moderate tightening of the fiscal instance in 2023.” 12.43pm BST The CBI has appointed a Chief People Officer to lead cultural change at the organisation, following a series of sexual misconduct allegations reported by the Guardian. As Interim Chief People Officer, Elizabeth Wallace will start the process of implementing the 35 recommendations put forward by law firm Fox Williams, which held an independent investigation into allegations of misconduct at the business lobby group.

Her role will be integral in reforming our people strategy- defining our shared values as we collectively recover from the challenges of recent weeks. With over two decades’ worth of experience, I’m confident that her guidance will accelerate our efforts to effect meaningful change across the CBI.” Earlier this month the CBI appointed business ethics consultancy Principia Advisory to help overhaul its operations. It has scheduled an extraordinary general meeting for midday on 6 June, after more than 50 large businesses, including John Lewis and NatWest, suspended or cancelled their membership following allegations of sexual misconduct/ Elizabeth Wallace has previously worked as Head of Portfolio Talent at private equity group Hg and Director of Executive Search at investment group BlackRock. Wallace says she will “lead the way on cultural transformation” at the CBI, adding: Making sure the newly created Chief People Officer role becomes a permanent part of the CBI’s DNA will be front of mind, as I work with people across the organisation to strengthen our employee experience offering.” 12.31pm BST The MPs also heard about the CMA’s concerns about the high profit margins at petrol retailers, particularly supermarkets: 🟡 Cardell flags rising retail margins in petrol and says this is &quot;particularly&quot; prominent in supermarkets. 🟡 She says &quot;what troubles us is that we are not seeing that competitive response&quot; from other supermarkets when one retailer increased internal targets — Helen Cahill (@HelCahill) May 16, 2023 Sarah Cardell told MPs on the Business and Trade Committee. “Supermarkets have historically been the cheapest suppliers by and large at the retail level,” “And I should say that it remains the case that many of the factors driving up petrol and diesel prices are external factors, including obviously the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “But nonetheless, what our evidence is showing us is that the rise in margins doesn’t appear to be entirely due to factors outside of retailers’ control. “What we appear to see is evidence that at least one of the supermarkets has increased its own internal targets for margins, we’re not seeing a strong competitive response from the other supermarkets there.” Updated at 12.57pm BST 12.06pm BST CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell then declined to give a view on the possible merger of Vodafone and Three, CK Hutchison’s UK businesses, as a deal hasn’t been formally agreed. She told MPs: “The situation that we’re in is, because we don’t yet have that as a merger to review, we can’t give, in a sense, a view now.” If a deal is reached, then a merger of Vodafone and Three would cut the number of UK mobile phone networks from 4 to 3. 11.48am BST Q: How much does the CMA discuss and co-ordinate with regulators in other juristictions when examining a deal, and specifically with the Microsoft-Activision deal. Sarah Cardell explains that the CMA is looking at significantly more deals following Brexit. Of course, the competition is ‘highly mindful’ of the need to ensure the continuity and integrity of analysis, but it’s the CMA’s role is to consider competition in the UK. She explains that the CMA was given a ‘waiver’ by the parties in the MS-Activision deal, so its staff could hold discussions with the European Commission. But towards the end of its discussions, it did not have a waiver to allow detailed discussions with the US FTC, so there was only limited discussions. Cardell insists the CMA does not do the bidding of other authorities, following some speculation that the FTC had put pressure on the UK regulators. MP insists to know more about interactions between CMA and FTC, but Cardell points to confidentiality restrictions. The longer this takes, the more it looks like Activision&apos;s CEO may have had a point about an alleged Khan-Cardell conspiracy to block the deal in the UK. 🧵17/X — Florian Mueller (@FOSSpatents) May 16, 2023 Updated at 12.02pm BST 11.39am BST CMA hits back against criticism of MS-Activision decision Q: Do you consider the implications of your decisions on the UK’s international reputation as a place to do business? This is a clear reference to Microsoft president Brad Smith’s claim that the CMA’s decision to block the Activision deal was “bad for Britain”, and that the EU was a better place to start a business. Sarah Cardell says the CMA absolutely committed to support competitive markets in a way that is “absolutely good” for the UK and its economy. The CMA’s chief executive explains to the Business and Trade committee that: Competition is a keystone, an absolutely foundational block of UK competitiveness. You want to have strong competition in markets, it promotes growth and promotes innovation. Q: Everyone’s in favour of competition in markets… do you consider our international reputation at all in your decisions, and whether the UK looks ‘open to business’? Individual cases need to be decided on their merits, Cardell insists. But ‘absolutely, the CMA thinks about the impact of its decisions when it considers its role strategically. Cardell hits back against the claim that the CMA has undermined the UK’s reputation, saying: I believe that strong competition is a very positive signal for the UK’s reputation externally. CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink wades in to support this point. Bokkerink tells MPs that all businesses know that there’s a big difference between building a business, or investing in a start-up, and buying an already well-established firm with established positions. The two are not the same, Bokkerink points out, saying: The UK has always encouraged, and it’s the CMA’s duty to support and encourage, open and competitive markets. Bokkerink questions whether confidence in the UK will be helped by “turning a blind eye to anti-competitive mergers”. Updated at 12.07pm BST 11.25am BST CMA: not in hostile environment with tech Q: It’s been reported that tech companies have been recruiting lots of lobbyists and persuaders to affect the work of the CMA – is that a concern? CMA CEO Sarah Cardell says the overall experience of engagement with the tech industry has been ‘very positive’. She meets regularly with senior representatives of tech companies and the industry. This is a sector where we want to work together, and create the best conditions for competition, Cardell explains. Of course, there will be individual decisions where we disagree, she adds, but: I don’t find that we are operating in a hostile environment. She cites a case against Google’s privacy sandbox, which was resolved constructively with a solution that’s now being rolled out worldwide. Updated at 11.25am BST 11.19am BST Q: So why did the EC feel differently about Microsoft’s remedy than the CMA? CMA CEO Sarah Cardell says we don’t have the detail behind Brussels’ decision yesterday to approve the deal. But the question for the CMA is whether, or not, the remedies would allow a market to continue with the same competitive dynamics as if the deal had not happened. The cloud gaming market is in early gestation, we want competition to flourish, Cardell declares, adding: There was a real concern on the part of the [CMA] group that if you accept the proposal that was tabled by Microsoft, it would constrain the way the market would evolve going forward. It would not replicate the conditions of full and fair competition that we would see in the absense of the merger. Reminder, the Commission said yesterday that Microsoft had made this commitment: A free license to consumers in the EEA that would allow them to stream, via any cloud game streaming services of their choice, all current and future Activision Blizzard PC and console games for which they have a license. A corresponding free license to cloud game streaming service providers to allow EEA-based gamers to stream any Activision Blizzard’s PC and console games. 11.12am BST CMA defends blocking MS-Activision deal Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, begins today’s session by explaining why the CMA is opposing Microsoft’s takeover of Activision Blizzard. Q&quot;: Where are we with the Microsoft-Activision deal? CMA CEO Sarah Cardell explains that the CMA’s decided at the end of April to prohibit the deal, due to concerns that competition in the cloud gaming market would suffer. Microsoft has a leading position in cloud, due to its cloud infrastructure, its Xbox gaming console and Windows. The CMA was concerned about Microsoft’s ability to take that position and combine it with Activision, and its significant portfolio of games (such as Call of Duty), Cardell explaines. It would lead to a lessening of competition, the CMA feared, as it would prevent other cloud gaming providers from competing effectively as the market develops. The CMA considered the proposed remedy from Microsoft “very carefully”, Cardell insists, but concluded it would not be a comprehensive and effective remedy. Microsoft, she says, offered a licencing deal that would set the terms of trade for the market for the next 10 years; determining the terms in which other cloud computing providers would get access to those games. This is a very important, evolving market, and the CMA wants to ensure it can evolve unincombered by regulatory constraints. The CMA has decided that the deal needs to be prohibited. The EC, though, decided yesterday to approve the deal. Cardell says the Commission did conclude there are competition concerns from the deal – so there is no difference between the EC and the CMA on that point. However, the Commission accepted Microsoft’s proposed remedy. Cardell adds: We remain of the view, from a UK perspecive, that it was not appropriate to accept that remedy. She reminds MPs that the US Department of Justice is also suing to block the deal. 10.55am BST MPs hold hearing with CMA Over in parliament, MPs on the Business and Trade Committee have begun a hearing on “The work of the Competition and Markets Authority”. Up before them, we have CMA chair Marcus Bokkerink, and chief executive Sarah Cardell.

Pushing in the same direction, the high cost of living is driving more people back into the workforce. The effect shows up in the latest labour figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as a fall of 55,000 in the number of vacancies in the three months to April and a 156,000 drop in the number of inactive workers. Separate HMRC figures showed a 136,000 fall in PAYE employees between March and April – the first reduction since February 2021. Put together, these figures tell us the UK’s pressure-cooker labour market – with lots of advertised jobs and too few workers to fill them – has begun to come off the boil. When the Bank of England’s main concern relates to the tightness of the labour market, which is reflected in a high vacancy rate, then these trends will be welcomed by anyone who wants interest rates to fall and growth to pick up….

This would make it the single biggest tax-raising measure since Geoffrey Howe doubled VAT in 1979. What will this mean?

The ZEW economic research institute’s gauge of investor morale in Germany has tumbled to -10.7 points, down from 4.1 points in April. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller drop, to -5.3. This brought the ZEW indicator back into negative territory for the first time since December 2022. GERMAN ZEW SURVEY MAY 2023 REPORT https://t.co/EF9HLg8mbE — alfred (@macronewswire) May 16, 2023 ZEW president Achim Wambach said. “As a result, the German economy could slip into a recession, albeit a mild one.” Wambach said that fears of further interest rate hikes by the European Central Bank weighed on morale, adding that the US debt ceiling deadlock was another factor: A possible default by the United States in the next few weeks also increases the uncertainty with regard to international economic development. 10.18am BST Full story: UK payroll numbers fall as unemployment rate rises to 3.9% The number of workers on UK employers’ payrolls dropped for the first time in two years last month amid signs that the flatlining economy has started to take a toll of Britain’s labour market, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports. Fresh figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a 136,000 fall in employees between March and April – the first reduction since February 2021. Although the ONS said the data was provisional, the numbers on payrolls provide the most timely guide to the state of the jobs market and will be seen as evidence of a cooling in demand for labour. Despite April’s fall, payrolls are more than 800,000 higher than they were in February 2020, the month before the UK went into its first Covid-19 lockdown. The official figures showed employment and unemployment up in the first three months of 2023. With the cost of living crisis hitting household budgets, there was a record flow of people out of inactivity and into work. The unemployment rate rose unexpectedly to 3.9% from 3.8%. Job vacancies fell by 55,000 to just over 1m in the three months ending in April, the 10th consecutive quarterly drop. The number of people inactive as a result of long-term sickness reached a fresh record of 2.55 million. The ONS director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, said: “Employment and unemployment both rose again in the first three months of 2023, driven in particular by men. This means the number of those neither working nor looking for work continues to fall, although the number of people not working due to long-term sickness rose again, to a new record.” Despite the highest pay growth in the public sector for two decades, the ONS said workers in public and private sectors were becoming worse off because prices were rising faster than wages. Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 7.0% and for the public sector was 5.6% in January to March, but the cost of living rose by 10.1% in the year to March. Meanwhile, the number of days lost through strikes rose from 332,000 in February to 556,000 in March, with 80% of the total the result of action in the health and education sectors.

The number of registered company insolvencies in England and Wales fell to 1,685 in April, 15% lower than the 1,988 which failed in April 2022. It’s also a third less than in March, when there were 2,471 insolvencies. Most of these were creditors’ voluntary liquidations (CVLs) in which a firm’s directors choose to close their company because it is insolvent. But the number of compulsory liquidations almost doubled, year on year, to 183. The Insolvency Service explains: Numbers of compulsory liquidations have increased from historical lows seen during the coronavirus pandemic, partly as a result of an increase in winding-up petitions presented by HMRC. Carla Matthews, head of contentious insolvency and asset recovery at PwC, says: “The number of insolvencies last month (1,685) was 15% lower than in the same month last year and down on the 2,457 seen in March. On the surface this looks encouraging and is likely due to increased business confidence and directors taking a more optimistic view of the economic outlook. Simultaneously, the Easter court break may have contributed to the reduction in compulsory liquidations. “However, we’re not out of the woods yet. The trading environment remains challenging for business, and while energy costs are starting to drop, both inflation and the cost of servicing debt remains stubbornly high, with commodity prices continuing to cause pressure across a range of sectors, so the outlook for the rest of the year may still be turbulent. 9.45am BST ING: nothing in UK wage data screaming the need for another rate hike Today’s UK labour market report (coverage starts here) shows that the heat is coming out of the UK jobs market, explains ING’s developed markets economist James Smith . Smith argues that there’s nothing in the UK wage data that screams the need for another rate hike either. He says: “Last month’s surprisingly strong UK wage growth figure was almost certainly a key driver behind last week’s Bank of England decision to raise interest rates further. This month though, the story appears more benign. The headline rate of regular pay growth, which compares the past three months to the same period last year, notched up to 6.7%. But the level of average weekly pay (ex bonuses) increased by only £2 in the past month, a slower pace than we saw through much of 2022 and indeed in the previous month (which now looks like an aberration). “Smoothing out recent volatility and comparing the most recent three months to the three months before, the rate of private sector wage growth has clearly slowed since 2022. That trend is also supported by the BoE’s own survey of businesses, which indicates that both price and pay pressures beginning to ebb. “Elsewhere there are further signs that the heat is coming out of the UK jobs market, albeit steadily. The unemployment rate inched up to 3.9%, while we saw the first monthly fall in employment since early 2021, at least according to the experimental payrolled employees measure.” 9.32am BST High street bakery chain Greggs continues to grow its sales amid the cost of living squeeze. Greggs reported that like-for-like sales so far this year are up 17.1% – partly because sales in early 2022 were hit by the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Greggs told the City it is seeing “particularly strong growth” in hot food and snacks including chicken goujons, wedges and pizza. Greggs continues to expand its range of plant-based food, with a vegan Mexican chicken-free bake. So far this year it has opened 63 new stores, and closed 26. Greggs warned this morning that it expects tto see “ongoing material cost inflation”, but it has covered itself against price rises in key commodities. As a shareholder I&apos;m content with Greggs update, sales rising strongly and coping well with inflation. Shares down 0,8% but not a worry after strong rise over past 12 months. I&apos;m staying in. — Rodney Hobson (@RodneyHobson) May 16, 2023 Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says, Gregg’s value proposition is holding up amid the backdrop of a softening consumer with strong demand for hot food and its growing plant-based offering after the success of its vegan sausage roll. However weaker disposable income and higher costs continue to be challenges for the bakery. Shares in Greggs are trading flat today but are up more than 18% year-to-date, sharply outperforming the wider market thanks to its resilient low price point offering.” 9.16am BST One in five workers will be higher-rate taxpayers by 2027 – IFS One in four teachers and one in eight nurses will be higher-rate taxpayers by 2027 as a result of the government’s record freeze on income tax allowances and thresholds, according to a leading thinktank this morning. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said better-paid public sector workers will be among the almost 8 million people – one in five of all taxpayers – who will pay income tax at 40% or above as result of the Treasury’s attempt to reduce the UK’s budget deficit. In what it described as the biggest tax-raising measure since the incoming Conservative government doubled VAT to 15% in 1979, the IFS said an additional 2.5 million people would no longer be basic rate taxpayers by the time the six-year freeze on allowances and thresholds came to an end in 2027-28.

The UK’s biggest supermarket is dropping the price of 30 products, with 15p off 500g and 1kg packs of own-brand pasta, 14p off its one litre vegetable oil and 15p off its one litre sunflower oil. Tesco group chief product officer Ashwin Prasad said: “As we see deflation coming through on key cupboard essentials such as pasta and cooking oil, we’re pleased to pass on these savings to customers. “We hope that by reducing prices on these 30 products which are bought week-in, week-out, we can help customers spend less.” According to the UN, global wholesale food prices hit record levels last April after the Ukraine invasion, but then fell over the next year. The announcement comes on the day Downing Street hosts a “Farm to Fork Summit”, bringing together farmers’ representatives and food and retail trade bodies along with supermarket chiefs to discuss boosting co-operation across the supply chain and the sector’s resilience – and tackling rampant food inflation, which jumped by over 19% in March. Interactive Updated at 9.05am BST 8.48am BST British firms’ demand for workers is cooling just as the workforce expands, the Resolution Foundation thinktank reports. Resolution points out that almost all of the post-pandemic rise on inactivity among those under 50 has now been unwound. This fell by 156,000 in the last three months alone – allaying fears that the pandemic has permanently put younger people off work, Resolution say. However, the longer-time rise in inactivity due to ill-health has reached a fresh record high of 2.55 million. Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, explains: “Britain’s workforce continued to expand and normalise in the early 2023 – allaying fear that the pandemic had permanently shrunk the workforce. But older workers – a large cohort of whom took early retirement during the Covid crisis – remain inactive in greater numbers than pre-pandemic. “But while the workforce is expanding, firms’ appetite for new workers is falling as vacancy levels continue to decline. How this affects unemployment and pay growth levels in the months ahead will be weighing on policy makers minds. While pay packets continue to shrink in real terms, the strength of pay growth in both the public and private sector, combined with likely falls in inflation in the months ahead, suggests that real wage growth could return soon.” 8.32am BST 556,000 working days were lost due to strikes in March 2023, the second highest figure in the last decade (the highest was Jan 2023 with 836,000), according to new ONS figures. https://t.co/WhFihOkzhS pic.twitter.com/rBlNdRmBQ4 — Emiliano Mellino (@Mellino) May 16, 2023 8.27am BST IES: More work needed to help people into work Despite dropping by 156,000 in the last quarter, there are still 8.73m people classed as economically inactive in the UK. That’s 361,000 more than before the pandemic. Tony Wilson, Director at the Institute for Employment Studies, explains how rising sickness is keeping people out of work: “The stand-out figure in today’s data is another sharp increase in the number of people off work with long-term health conditions, up by nearly a hundred thousand in the last quarter to over 2.5 million people. This is now comfortably the largest number of people out of the labour market due to long-term health problems that we have ever seen. This is being masked to some extent by a fall in overall economic inactivity, which is mainly being driven by big falls in the number of students, with student numbers almost back to where they were before the pandemic. So it looks like those people closer to work are still moving into jobs, while those more disadvantaged in the labour market are getting left behind. Long Covid is one factor, with many sufferers reporting unfair treatment or lack of support from employers. Long NHS waiting lists are another cause. The number of people in England waiting to start hospital treatment rose to a new high of 7.22m in February. Wilson says a lot more could be done to help people out of work to prepare for work and to get back in, and particularly those with long-term health conditions. The announcements at the Budget on this were a start, but will largely only replace provision that is already in place and due to end next year. So we need to see more focus in our existing employment services like Jobcentre Plus and the Restart Scheme on helping these groups, and more investment in the sorts of specialist employment support, occupational health and workplace practices that will make a difference.” 8.21am BST This chart shows how the decrease in economic inactivity during the latest quarter was largely driven by those aged 16 to 24 years. A chart showing economic inactivity in the UK Photograph: ONS While more of those younger workers found jobs, or registered as unemployed, there’re wasn’t much change in the over-50s. Indeed the inactivtiy rate among 50-64 year olds who were economically inactive rose in the last month, as that chart shows. Updated at 8.36am BST 8.11am BST Rising costs mean UK businesses are hesitating to hire workers, the Institute of Directors reports. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the IoD, says this has pushed up the unemployment rate: “A combination of high costs and cash-strapped consumers is now causing some businesses to hesitate before hiring, uncertain as to what the future holds. As a result, the number of employees has fallen for the first time in over two years, and the unemployment rate is starting to rise from its post-pandemic low. Ussher adds that firms are struggling to find workers with the right skills: “But there is also evidence of a skills mismatch, with other organisations finding it hard to recruit the talent they need even as unemployment goes up – there are still 282 thousand more vacancies in the UK than before the pandemic. Government policy needs to work harder to ensure that our education and training system is providing the types of skills that employers are looking for.” 8.07am BST Unions are understandably alarmed that real wages are continuing to fall, with inflation outpacing earnings growth (see 7.42am post). TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says ministers must give public sector workers a fair pay rise to end the industrial action hitting the economy. “Workers have lost more than £1,000 from their pay over the last year. But there’s still no end in sight for the longest wages slump in modern history. “Real wages remain below where they were in 2008, and the already 15-year pay squeeze is set to last another three years, until 2026. “It is little surprise that workers are having to take strike action to defend their living standards. They have been pushed to breaking point. “Ministers must focus on resolving all of the current pay disputes. “And they must act now to put money in people’s pockets – starting with giving our public sector workers a real pay rise, boosting the minimum wage to £15 per hour, and ending their attack on the right to strike for better pay and conditions in the Strikes Bill.” Updated at 8.07am BST 8.03am BST Minister Opperman: continuing to see progress in the labour market It may sound odd that unemployment and employment could both rise in a quarter, as they did in January-March. But this graph shows how it happened: more people stopped being economically inactive, and either moved into jobs or were registered as out of work: The minister for employment, Guy Opperman MP says there are signs of progress in today’s labour force data: “We’re continuing to see progress in the labour market as we take action across government to grow the economy. Employment is up; economic inactivity is down; and vacancies have fallen in successive quarters. “As well as helping deliver on our priority to grow the economy, we know that being in work remains the best way for people to get on in life. That’s why I’m focused on matching jobseekers with roles, and businesses with a resilient and skilled workforce. Through partnerships with local employers, we have thousands of placements in sectors such as banking and engineering, helping people to achieve new qualifications and build rewarding careers.” 7.55am BST Hunt: must support those who want to work Chancellor the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt (who has been trying to chivvy the over-50s back into work), says: “It’s encouraging that the unemployment rate remains historically low but difficulty in finding staff and rising prices are a worry for many families and businesses. That’s why we must stick to our plan to halve inflation and help families with the cost of living, while delivering our childcare reforms and supporting older people and disabled people who want to work.” Hunt is correct that a 3.9% jobless rate is historically low. But, the unemployment rate has been rising since last summer – it was just 3.5% in June-August 2022, the lowest since 1974. 7.46am BST Vodafone to cut 11,000 jobs worldwide The troubled mobile operator giant Vodafone is to cut 11,000 jobs from its global workforce over the next three years. The company, which has seen its share price slump to a two-decade low, said it needed to restructure its business to compete against rivals and improve the experience for its tens of millions of customers. The job cuts, which follow the announcement in November of a €1bn (£870m) cost savings plan, mark the first big move by the new group chief executive, Margherita Della Valle. “Today I am announcing my plans for Vodafone,” said former finance chief Della Valle, who was appointed chief executive last month. “Our performance has not been good enough. To consistently deliver, Vodafone must change.” More here: Related: Vodafone to cut 11,000 jobs worldwide over next three years 7.44am BST ONS: Employment and unemployment up; wages still lagging inflation Here’s ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan to explain today’s UK labour market report report: “Employment and unemployment both rose again in the first three months of 2023, driven in particular by men. This means the number of those neither working nor looking for work continues to fall, although the number of people not working due to long-term sickness rose again, to a new record. “However, the number of people on employers’ payrolls fell in April for the first time in over two years, though this is an early estimate that could be revised later. “Despite continued growth in pay, people’s average earnings are still being outstripped by rising prices. “The number of days lost to strikes rose again in March, with education and health making up four-fifths of the total this month. 7.42am BST Pay continues to lag inflation UK workers continued to be hit by falling real wages, with earnings continuing to lag behind rising prices. Average total pay, including bonuses, rose by 5.8% per year in the January-March quarter. Regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose to 6.7%, up from 6.6%. Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 7.0% and for the public sector was 5.6% in January to March 2023. A larger rise for public sector pay was last seen in August to October 2003 (5.7%), the ONS says. However, CPI inflation was 10.1% in March, so real wages are still falling. Updated at 7.44am BST 7.31am BST Strike action intensified in March, the labour market report shows. There were 556,000 working days lost because of labour disputes in March 2023, up from 332,000 in February 2023. During March, teachers, doctors and civil servants all held strikes, in industrial action in rows over pay and conditions. Related: UK strike calendar – service stoppages planned for March and April 7.20am BST The number of people out of work, and economically inactive because of long-term sickness increased to a record high in the last quarter, today’s jobs report shows. 7.17am BST Introduction: UK unemployment rate rises, as payroll numbers fall Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK’s unemployment rate has risen, with companies shedding workers as the jobs market cools, and more people look for work. Figures just released by the Office for National Statistics show that the UK’s jobless rate rose to 3.9% in the January-March quarter, up from 3.8% a month earlier. The increase in unemployment was largely driven by people unemployed for over 12 months, the ONS says. More timely data shows that firms cut their payrolls by 136,000 in April, to 29.8 million. This is the first fall in total payrolled employees since February 2021, the ONS says (adding that the data may be revised next month). A sign that the economy has lost momentum, with higher interest rates weighing on demand. The number of employees on the payroll fell by 136,000 in April 2023, its first fall since February 2021. It is now 838,000 above its pre #COVID19 pandemic level. ➡️ https://t.co/0X3dcQxySA pic.twitter.com/kFw1GvDSBC — Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) May 16, 2023 In another sign that the labour market is weakening, the number of vacancies fell by 55,000 on the quarter to 1,083,000 in February-April. The ONS says: Vacancies fell on the quarter for the 10th consecutive period and reflect uncertainty across industries, as survey respondents continue to cite economic pressures as a factor in holding back on recruitment. But, there has also been a notable move of people back into the labour market – either finding work, or looking for it. This has pulled the UK’s economic inactivity rate down by 0.4 percentage points on the quarter, to 21.0% in January to March. The ONS says: The decrease in economic inactivity during the latest three-month period was largely driven by people aged 16 to 24 years. Looking at economic inactivity by reason, the quarterly decrease was largely driven by those inactive because they are students or inactive for other reasons Flows estimates show that, between October to December 2022 and January to March 2023, there has been a record high net flow out of economic inactivity. This was driven by people moving from economic inactivity to employment. This has also nudged up the UK’s employment rate to 75.9% in January to March 2023, 0.2 percentage points higher than October to December 2022. The increase in employment over the latest three-month period was driven by part-time employees and self-employed workers, the ONS says.

    <head>How to cook okra: go small, don’t get them wet, and fry with tomatoes and spices</head>
    <body>The visceral response some people have to the merest mention of okra speaks to the way its unique textural properties stick in one’s memory – stick being the operative word. Okra’s characteristic gloop is the product of the vegetable’s naturally occurring mucilage, which is activated by exposing its innards through slicing and through extended cooking (like in a stew). Mind you, its propensity to simmer into slime over time is part of the appeal in certain dishes like gumbo from America’s south and west African okra stew, where it acts as a thickener for the sauce. Think of okra like a mogwai in the Gremlins films: if you want it to stay cute, don’t get it wet But if you prefer to mitigate the mucilage, it’s easier than you think. Choose smaller okra and trim only the top of the stem so the pods remain whole. This means the mucilage, which is contained within the body, doesn’t get a chance to go gooey. And think of okra like a mogwai in the Gremlins films: if you want it to stay cute, don’t get it wet. Instead of washing, just pat okra with a damp cloth to remove dirt. To mitigate the mucilage, choose smaller okra, and trim only the top of the stem, keeping the pod whole. Photograph: Rochelle Eagle/The Guardian Fat forms an effective waterproof barrier, which is why frying okra first – a bit like searing meat for a casserole or curry – is a great way to build flavour and stop slime. There’s no need to be too prescriptive on how long to fry them as okra can actually be eaten entirely raw. Finely slice, salt and team with bonito for a Japanese okra salad, blanch whole and combine with a Cantonese soy-sauce-based gravy or with a zippy red wine vinaigrette for Brazilian salada de quiabo. Acid also helps, which is why you’ll often find okra teamed with lemon juice, vinegar or a tomato-based sauce, like in my recipe below. Frying okra is great for flavour and also helps save your dish from sliminess. Photograph: Rochelle Eagle/The Guardian For me, okra is special because when you bite into it, the slippery texture is a lot like a gelatinous slow-cooked cut of meat. This makes it perfect for battering and deep-frying (so juicy!) and for vegetarian and vegan curries like this one, which is a very midweek take on a north Indian bhindi masala. Tomatoes, spices and fried okra: Alice Zaslavsky’s autopilot okra curry. Photograph: Rochelle Eagle/The Guardian Autopilot okra curry I’ve intentionally kept the spicing as simple as possible – a tablespoon each of your favourite garam masala and Indian-style curry powder. If you’d prefer to make up your own mix, go right ahead. I’ve chosen tinned cherry tomatoes because I like the way they bob about in the sauce, but other tinned tomatoes (whole peeled or chopped) are just fine. If you have fresh tomatoes waiting to be used, feel free to use these instead – four to five medium tomatoes (around 750g), roughly chopped, will take an extra 10 minutes or so simmering. In Australia, okra is still at its best for another couple of months. But this autopilot tomato gravy can be used year-round for all manner of veg, from green beans to blanched cauliflower or broccoli. Related: Is your fridge a vegetable graveyard? How to revive dead produce into crisper soup Serves 4 3 tbsp neutral oil (I like grapeseed) 450g small okra, wiped clean and tops trimmed 1 large red onion, finely sliced 1 tbsp garam masala 1 tbsp mild Madras curry powder ⅛ tsp chilli powder (or go heavier if you dare) 1 thumb’s worth of ginger, grated 3-4 garlic cloves, minced 2 tins cherry tomatoes (800g total) ½ tsp sugar (optional, but it will make any tomato-based sauce sing) 1 tsp salt Steamed basmati rice and naan, to serve Minted yoghurt 150g natural yoghurt 2 tbsp fresh mint leaves, finely sliced, plus small mint leaves for garnish Heat a large heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add two tablespoons of the oil and wait for it to shimmer, then fry the okra until golden brown. Transfer to a bowl and reserve. Pour the remaining oil in the pan, add the sliced onion and wait for it to sizzle. Lower the heat, cover and sweat for six to eight minutes until the onions are soft and glistening. Add the garam masala, curry powder, chilli powder, ginger and garlic to the pan, stir and simmer for one to two minutes until unavoidably aromatic. Add the tomatoes (pour a splash of water into the near-empty tins to slosh out the remaining tinned juices into the pan), sugar (if using) and salt, and simmer vigorously for eight to 10 minutes, uncovered. Stir occasionally and allow the sauce to thicken and reduce. Meanwhile, to make the mint yoghurt, stir the sliced mint through the yoghurt and set aside. When the sauce is reduced by half, taste for seasoning. Tumble in the reserved okra and simmer for two to three minutes to reheat the okra and introduce it to its new saucy home. Serve with rice, naan and minted yoghurt.</body>

    <head>Waterloo South public housing residents will be rehoused nearby after sale, NSW government pledges</head>
    <body>The New South Wales housing minister, Rose Jackson, is moving to reassure tenants in the Waterloo South public housing they will be rehoused within the suburb and offered spots back in the complex when the controversial development is completed. Related: NSW urged to override councils to boost affordable housing near Sydney metro and train stations The government has been fending off criticism for proceeding with the sale and is pushing forward with plans to sell more land to developers for housing, despite promising to end privatisation and freeze the sale of all social housing assets. Jackson said the sale of public housing estates in Glebe and Eveleigh will be paused under that freeze. Despite the promise to keep Waterloo residents close to their home, tenants living in the inner-city block say they remain in the dark and have been calling for more clarity from the government. The premier, Chris Minns, last week confirmed the Waterloo sale would go ahead with “improvements” to the social and affordable housing mandates outlined by the previous government. The sale of land at the Waterloo estate will proceed under the new Labor government. Photograph: Isabella Moore/The Guardian Jackson said the redevelopment of Waterloo was a “great opportunity to deliver a substantial uplift” for both social and general housing supply in the inner city, but only if the government improved on the “botched” Perrottet government plan. She said residents would be moved to new dwellings in Waterloo. “People will be given the opportunity to relocate in the local area and to return to that building if they want,” she said. But residents said the new government has yet to inform them about their future and accused Labor of “doing exactly what the Liberals did”. Ron Hoenig, the state MP for Heffron who is now the local government minister, had written to tenants prior to the election urging them to send a message – “Hands off Waterloo” – to the Liberal party by voting Labor. “You have the opportunity to stop the sell-off of the Waterloo public housing estate and protect your home,” he wrote. Karyn Brown, who has been a Waterloo resident for 21 years, said: “A lot of people thought it wouldn’t go ahead because that’s what they said.” Karyn Brown says she feels let down by the move to proceed with the redevelopment at the Waterloo estate. Photograph: Isabella Moore/The Guardian She said that given almost half of the tenants of the 749 social housing units on the site are over the age of 55 and the redevelopment could take 15-20 years, most tenants would be unlikely to return. Brown said she felt let down. “One of my neighbours on election night said to me ‘I can finally sleep tonight because we’re safe now’,” she said. “Now we know it’s not true.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Theresa Haines, who grew up in Waterloo, said her mother – a resident in one of the buildings flagged for redevelopment – wasn’t aware that it was going ahead. “It’s pretty sad, because this is our community, and we have people that have been living here for decades, and [for] most of their lives,” she said. Faced with a statewide housing crisis, the Minns government has focused on increasing housing supply. The premier has also requested departments to find unused land to be sold for housing. Theresa Haines, with her children Ava and John, says her mother isn’t yet aware the redevelopment is going ahead. Photograph: Isabella Moore/The Guardian Minns on Tuesday repeatedly said such actions, including the sale of social housing, was not privatisation and was in line with policies taken to the election. “I don’t think this meets even the loosest definition of privatisation,” he said. The government has pledged to ensure 30% of homes built on government land will be social and affordable housing. But the opposition leader, Mark Speakman, said such land sales were a form of privatisation. Related: Australia must realise the best form of rent control is public housing | Alistair Sisson “If you have a public asset that is sold to a private developer, that is privatisation,” he said. Macquarie University housing expert Dr Alistair Sisson argued the Waterloo redevelopment would result in a reduction in the state’s overall public housing stock that could take up to a decade to replace. “There are more than 50,000 households on the waiting list for public housing in NSW. There are more than 1,000 on the waiting list in the inner city,” he said. “These households will now have to wait longer because tenants in Waterloo South will be forced to relocate.” The Greens housing spokesperson, Jenny Leong, said the government should not be selling the estate but if they do push ahead, the public housing residents should be allowed to stay and have their homes refurbished. “In the midst of a housing affordability crisis and massive public housing shortage, there is no excuse for evicting people from their public housing homes and into housing insecurity,” she said. Any further development at the site should commit at least 45% of the new apartments as public housing, with the remainder for affordable homes, Leong said.</body>

    <head>Potential antidote found for toxin in world’s most poisonous mushroom</head>
    <body>Scientists believe they have found a potential antidote for a potent toxin found in the world’s most poisonous mushroom, the death cap. The death cap mushroom, Amanita phalloides, is responsible for about 90% of mushroom-related deaths globally. Its principal toxin is a peptide called α-Amanitin, a type of amatoxin which results in liver and kidney failure. Chinese and Australian researchers have identified that indocyanine green, a dye currently approved in the US for use in medical imaging, appears to block the toxic effects of α-Amanitin. The study’s corresponding author, Prof Qiaoping Wang of Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China, said that previously no specific antidote existed for death caps “because we know little about how mushroom toxins kill cells”. In tests in mice as well as human cell lines in the lab, the scientists found that indocyanine green was able to prevent liver and kidney damage that was induced by α-Amanitin. It also improved the probability of survival after poisoning. “While the results are promising, further clinical experiments are needed to determine whether indocyanine green has similar effects in humans,” Wang said. A fungi expert and the chief scientist at Sydney’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Prof Brett Summerell, who was not involved in the research, said death cap mushrooms were “extraordinarily dangerous and toxic” and were often mistaken for other mushrooms because of superficial similarities. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “The death cap can in the early growth stages resemble some of the straw mushrooms, which are … popular, particularly in a range of Asian cuisines,” Summerell said. “In those early stages it can be quite difficult to differentiate the mushrooms,” he said. “It’s a white creamy colour. As they get a bit older you can start to get a greeny-yellow tinge to them in the death caps. “Death caps have an association with the roots of oak tree, so if you see something that’s under an oak tree, that’s really when you need to be careful and suspicious.” While the toxins found in some other mushrooms can be degraded by heat, death cap toxins are “robust throughout cooking”, he added. “Mushroom poisoning is the main cause of mortality in food poisoning incidents worldwide,” the study’s authors note. Αlpha-Amanitin exerts its toxic effects on cells by inhibiting specific enzymes required for protein production. To work, the toxin relies on a protein in the body called STT3B. Indocyanine green appears to work by inhibiting the function of STT3B. The researchers found beneficial effects in mice treated with indocyanine green four hours after poisoning with α-Amanitin, but not in mice treated only eight or 12 hours after they were exposed to the toxin. “This may be because [α-Amanitin] has caused irreversible damage … which is unable to be salvaged,” the researchers concluded. “This suggests that [indocyanine green] should be given as early as possible during treatment.” The research was published in the journal Nature Communications. • This article was amended on 17 May 2023. An earlier image was said to show death caps mushrooms but showed both a death cap mushroom and a yellow-staining mushroom. This has been replaced.</body>

    <head>The staggering omission that led to Deaths Inside, the tally tracking Indigenous deaths in custody</head>
    <body>In cities across Australia in 2020, as Black Lives Matter protests erupted around the world, the number 432 was everywhere – displayed on banners at rallies and at marches. “That number didn’t exist before we published Deaths Inside,” says Calla Wahlquist, one of the Guardian Australia journalists behind the massive data-based project. Black Lives Matter protesters rally in Melbourne in June 2020. Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images Eight months in the making, Deaths Inside identified every Indigenous death in Australian custody known to have taken place since the royal commission into these deaths delivered its 1991 report – laying bare how little had changed in the intervening 27 years. Part of its genesis dates back to August 2014, when a 22-year-old Aboriginal woman named Ms Dhu died in police custody in Western Australia while serving time for unpaid fines. Ms Dhu was 22 when she died in a police cell. This photo was supplied by her family Photograph: Supplied by Ms Dhu’s family For four weeks from October 2015 Wahlquist reported on Ms Dhu’s inquest, writing two or three stories a day. “In the early days of the Guardian, because we knew we couldn’t cover everything, what we did we went all in on,” she says. “By being in court every day, we didn’t allow the story to fade away.” The then deputy editor of Guardian Australia, Will Woodward, requested a wrap-up piece, suggesting that it include how many people had died since the royal commission. “I was like, ‘OK, I’ll figure that out,’” Wahlquist says. “And I couldn’t figure it out. Because they didn’t have any data available.” The Australian Institute of Criminology – the body required to publish reports on deaths in custody – was years behind. States and territories weren’t providing information, and there was a lag in coronial inquests. So Wahlquist started keeping a list. When Lorena Allam joined Guardian Australia as Indigenous affairs editor in 2018, greater resources allowed greater ambition. Calla Wahlquist in Melbourne. She says an investigation tracking deaths in custody was ‘desperately needed’. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The Guardian Allam wanted to cover Indigenous affairs in a new way. “Our issues were just being absolutely bulldozed in the mainstream media,” she says. “When they were reported, they were reported by white people from the white perspective. Our people were very rarely given voice. “On deaths in custody we were just the nameless, faceless dead … there was no interest and yet it just ground on and on.” A Guardian investigation tracking the deaths “was everyone’s idea”, Wahlquist says, “because it was so desperately needed”. Editor Lenore Taylor gave them the green light – but a huge amount of work was required. Data and interactives editor Nick Evershed came onboard, along with intern Jack Banister and a freelance researcher, Miles Herbert. The team spent days, nights and weekends trawling through more than 450 coronial inquests. “Every inquest was read by two people,” Allam says. Some information wasn’t on websites, or didn’t clarify if the deceased was Indigenous – leading to more calls. Data and interactives editor Nick Evershed at home in Sydney: ‘It was the most research that we’ve ever done on a project.’ Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian “[Coroners and custodial services] would use terms like ‘natural causes’ when we would say their physical health deteriorated rapidly when entering custody because they were given substandard medical care,” Allam says. For the data team, it ended up being one of the biggest projects in Guardian Australia’s history. “It was the most research that we’ve ever done on a project – every square is a story, case inquest, media report that one of us had to read,” Evershed says. “It made it possible to say a lot more about deaths in custody in Australia than had ever been done since the royal commission. It allowed us to say things like procedures weren’t followed for Indigenous people in custody more often than for non-Indigenous people.” Related: The startling evidence of racism Queensland police couldn’t shrug off | Ten years of Guardian Australia The team soon realised the sheer volume of deaths made it impossible to reach every family. They only used names with express permission, and silhouettes on tiled squares representing lives lost. For Allam, the biggest decision was how to report these stories in a way that didn’t further upset families after painful inquests. “For families to sit in a room and have your daughter or your son or your nephew discussed in such cold ways … you’re a voiceless family member in that process,” she says. Allam speaks from experience. She has a cousin in Deaths Inside, and attended the inquest into his death with his grandmother. “It was very, very important to make sure that we connected the numbers to people,” she says. And families reached out. “It was confronting, it was saddening for them,” she says. “But we ended up having people contacting us and saying, ‘You don’t have my son, he should be in there.’ They wanted their loved ones counted.” She says Deaths Inside and Black Lives Matter have changed how media report deaths in custody: “One thing I noticed afterwards was how many more journalists were turning up to inquests than there used to be.” Wahlquist says the database has become a resource for lawyers researching deaths, and has led to improvements in real-time reporting. Related: How a leaked USB stick became the Nauru files – a tale of brutality and despair told in 160,000 words | Ten years of Guardian Australia Ms Dhu’s death was attributed to septicemia caused by an infection in a rib broken by her violent partner some weeks before. The coroner found she died of “natural causes” – a term that, to Wahlquist, denotes peace and denies accountability. In Deaths Inside, her death was attributed to medical issues after assault. At the bottom of her card it reads: “issues raised, medical care required, but not all given, procedures not all followed, force used”. “Measuring impact for some stories is easier than others, because some stories have an easy fix,” Evershed says. “This situation is long-running, caused by a huge amount of factors interplayed between state law, territory law, disadvantage … it’s so complex to look at but this was, in many ways, the basic level of reporting. “Putting it on the record and saying, ‘Yes, this many deaths, these people died in these circumstances.’ It wasn’t all there before. And now it is.” The number now stands at 540. The database will be updated again this year.

    <head>Derek Bromley in final bid for freedom after nearly 40 years in South Australian jail for murder</head>
    <body>A man who has spent almost 40 years in prison for a murder he says he did not commit will have his final chance at having his conviction overturned by the high court this week. Derek Bromley and his accomplice, John Karpany, were jailed for life for the murder of Stephen Docoza, whose body was found floating in Adelaide’s River Torrens in 1984. Bromley and Karpany were accused of bludgeoning Docoza to death after he refused their sexual advances at what was then a gay beat on the banks of the river. Related: Derek Bromley to make one last bid for freedom after nearly 40 years in jail for murder In 2004 Karpany was released on parole. Bromley has been eligible for parole since 2006, but his applications have been denied as he will not accept he committed the crime. The high court will hear Bromley’s appeal this week, giving him a chance to walk free after four decades. Bromley’s quest for freedom has been spurred on by legislation passed in 2013 that allows prisoners to appeal again if they have “fresh and compelling” evidence. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The case has been referred to the full court, which will hear the leave to appeal and the substantive appeal together over two days. The Flinders University legal academic Bob Moles, who has extensively researched the case, said there had been no other case in Australia where a prisoner has had their conviction overturned after 40 years. He said the appeal hung on two arguments – that the eyewitness was unreliable and the forensic pathologist did not have adequate training to determine the cause of death. “The problem with the eyewitness was that he was suffering from what’s called a schizoaffective disorder,” Moles said. “He was suffering from visual and audible hallucinations on the evening that the incident occurred. He thought he was the king of Adelaide and a top league footballer.” In his 2018 application to the court of criminal appeal, Bromley’s lawyers argued that on the same day the witness said he saw Bromley murder Docoza, he was also hospitalised for several months because of his severe mental health illness. Bromley’s lawyers also questioned the evidence of the forensic pathologist Colin Manock, whose work in some cases had since been challenged. The journalist Drew Rooke wrote a book on Manock and had extensively researched his life. Manock only had a medical degree, but was given the job out of desperation to fill the position, he said. “[Manock] had the qualifications on paper but they had been more or less been gifted to him … he didn’t have to undergo the five years of training that his peers had to undergo, nor did he have to sit a very extensive and detailed, written exam,” Rooke said. Docoza’s body had been submerged in the water for several days after he died and had undergone serious decomposition – yet Manock found he had been grabbed by the neck and drowned. “After that amount of time and that amount of decomposition, particularly in water, it’s widely recognised in the field of forensic science that it becomes very difficult to provide conclusive findings about the cause of death,” Rooke said. Moles said Bromley’s case could be one of the worst miscarriages of justice in history. “I have every reason to believe that the high court will do the job properly, will apply the law correctly and the conviction will be overturned.” Manock could not be reached for comment.</body>

    <head>Little Women has many film adaptations but only one gave Jo the ending she deserves</head>
    <body>Let’s face it: remakes are often unnecessary at best and inferior at worst. That said, I don’t imagine most people consider Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women when contemplating the redundancy of reboots, despite it being adapted for film more times than, say, A Star Is Born (which has been rebooted so many times it should be retitled A Planetary Nebula). Unless you count Mariah Carey’s Glitter, which is ostensibly the Black and Gold knock-off of A Star Is Born – it’s been remade four times. By comparison there are five Little Women adaptations. The latest and in my humble opinion, the best of which was made by Greta Gerwig. The trailer for Little Women Little Women is a coming-of-age story about the March sisters, namely Jo, a tomboy and writer; Amy, an artist with a penchant for pretty things; Meg, the dutiful and protective eldest sister; and Beth, the sweet, albeit one-dimensional and doomed one. I love the original novel (or novels, if you consider it was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869) with all my heart. You would think that my esteem for the original text would leave me leery of film adaptations but no. I’m especially fond of Gillian Armstrong’s 1994 version, starring Winona Ryder and a baby-faced Christian Bale, with it’s crackling yuletide logs and warm maternal embraces. (Being Australian, I don’t even know what a yuletide log is.) Related: Barbie: first trailer for Greta Gerwig’s movie starring Margot Robbie But as much as I adore Armstrong’s version, it’s Gerwig’s remake that truly moves me. I applaud the casting of Saoirse Ronan as the indomitable Jo March, and respect the long-overdue redemption of Amy, played by Florence Pugh. Notable mention goes to Timothée Chalamet as Laurie, if for no reason other than his petite stature being grounds enough for a Little Men spin-off. Mostly I love Gerwig’s film because it allows us to see – inevitable spoiler alert − Jo come into her own in the final act. Amid pressure from her publisher and readers, Alcott acquiesced to giving Jo a neat romantic ending with an older professor, Friedrich Bhaer. It’s arguably an unsatisfying conclusion because Jo nearly represented a consequence-free refutation of gendered strictures. She lived fearlessly, authentically and creatively. She was a guide for how to be a girl but not only a girl. Having her marry Bhaer sent a message: that our imaginative lives are auxiliary to our domestic duties, or at best a folly of childhood. Moreover it told us that settling down – or that settling, period – is not just necessary but inevitable. Saoirse Ronan, Laura Dern, Eliza Scanlen, Florence Pugh and Emma Watson in Little Women. Photograph: Wilson Webb/CTMG Gerwig knew audiences haven’t felt an affinity with Jo’s fate for many years so she concludes her film with a meta-twist in which two endings play out in tandem. Jo writes an ending to her novel at the behest of her publisher in which her protagonist marries. We see Jo opening a school in cantankerous Aunt March’s mansion, surrounded by Bhaer and her sprawling family. But we also see Jo watching her novel being printed. Her burgeoning career, we are positioned to believe, is what is really real, or at least what really matters. This new ending is a twist but not a twist of the knife. Indeed it’s deferential to Alcott, a nod to the end she wanted to write (she had wanted Jo to be a “literary spinster”, in her own words) but couldn’t because of the demands of the day. The kiss in the rain under Bhaer’s brolly might as well be off-camera. Instead, seeing Jo behold her very own book is the stuff of deep, abiding love. So, in an age of endless reboots, Gerwig’s Little Women is not a derivative cash-grab. In allowing Jo’s star to be born (sorry not sorry) she has rediscovered the pulsing heartbeat of Little Women. Jo famously bemoans that she is “so sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for”. And she is right, in a sense. But also wrong, because love is all: not just romantic love but the love we feel for family, for strangers, for art, for creativity, for writing. And, thanks to Gerwig, Jo finally exists in a time when women can have all that.</body>

    <head>Regional Australia property market dips as prestige areas give up pandemic gains</head>
    <body>Regional Australia’s housing market has taken another hit with prestige areas such as Byron Bay continuing to reverse pandemic gains. Richmond-Tweed (-24.2%), the southern highlands and Shoalhaven (-16.0%) and Illawarra (-13.7%) in New South Wales recorded the largest annual declines in house values. According to CoreLogic’s Regional Market Update, all 25 regional areas monitored recorded an annual decrease in the number of house sales in the past year. Related: Short-term rentals destroying ‘social fabric’ of region, Byron Bay residents tell inquiry Just over a quarter of Australia’s largest 25 non-capital city regions recorded an increase in house values over the year to April, down from just over 50% last year. Some regions still posted upturns, with South Australia’s south-east region performing the best, with values rising 10.8%, followed by the New England and north-west (NSW) and Bunbury (Western Australia) regions, up 4.9% and 4.8% respectively. The three largest decreases in house sales all came from NSW, including Richmond-Tweed (-39.9%), followed closely by southern highlands and Shoalhaven (-39.1%), and mid north coast (-33.3%). Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Richmond-Tweed region, which includes areas such as Lismore, Ballina, Byron Bay and Tweed Heads, was the weakest-performing regional market across the country, which comes after a dramatic spike in house values during the pandemic. The CoreLogic Australia economist Kaytlin Ezzy said the declines recorded in some of these markets were not surprising. “Over the past year, premium lifestyle markets have been hardest hit by softer market conditions and rate increases,” she said. “These markets were among the largest beneficiaries of regional migration through the Covid-induced upswing and, as a result, became significantly more sensitive to the rising cost of debt and the normalisation in regional migration trends.” House values in the Richmond-Tweed region surged by 51% during the pandemic, before rising interest rates, booking property prices and the lingering impacts of the 2022 floods saw values fall -24.2% over the year to April. According to the report, houses sold fastest in Toowoomba, Queensland over the three months to April, with an average time on market of 21 days, followed by Western Australia’s Bunbury region (27 days). The regions with the longest-selling time were the southern highlands and Shoalhaven, with an average of 79 days on the market. The new data comes as Sydney recorded a new low in rental listings, with the number of new listings falling 17% month-on-month in April on realestate.com.au, the lowest it had been in a decade. According to the new PropTrack Market Insight, this was the fewest new listings since April 2012. New rental listings across the country fell by 18.9% month-on-month, the largest fall since 2017. Total listings fell -16.5% in the past year in capital cities, led by Melbourne (-31.3%), Sydney (-15.7%) and Perth (-19.2%). PropTrack’s director of economic research and report author Cameron Kusher said the results reflected a deepening of the rental crisis across the country. “I think in Sydney and Melbourne, there’s potentially more that it could drop. Just because we know that migration to Australia is really strong and we know that most migrants tend to settle in Sydney and Melbourne,” he said. Kusher added that supply would continue to be a problem, leaving a “very tough market” for renters. “I think it’s going to continue to be a problem and the main reason for that is supply takes time. There’s a lot of stock under construction, but most of it has been sold to owner-occupiers rather than investors. So that doesn’t really help the rental market.”</body>

    <head>Labor urged to return employment services to public sector amid warning over mutual obligations</head>
    <body>The Albanese government is facing a push to return employment services to the public sector as a union warns mutual obligations are doing “more harm than good”. An influential parliamentary committee is examining privatised employment services, with the government mulling an overhaul of a $7bn system it says is not working. As new analysis from the Australian Council of Social Service reveals compliance under the new Workforce Australia system is still disproportionately affecting vulnerable jobseekers, the Community and Public Sector Union has told the inquiry the system will not be fixed by “tinkering” or “tweaking”. Related: Labor leaves door open for jobseeker recipients to work more hours before losing payments In a submission, the CPSU said the government should immediately suspend mutual obligations and called for the creation of a public sector job agency. “There’s overwhelming evidence now that the mutual obligation system is punitive, and is doing more harm than good,” the union’s assistant national secretary, Michael Tull, said. Tull said the evidence suggested the suspension of mutual obligations during the pandemic “made it easier for people to find employment and improve their engagement with the labour market”. The argument is at odds with two decades of bipartisan consensus that relies on mutual obligations and compliance to get people into jobs. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Currently, jobseekers must attend compulsory appointments with a private provider, submit a set number of job applications and undertake other courses, training or activities as part of a “points” system. Those who do not meet obligations have their payments suspended until they rectify the issue. Supporters say suspensions act as a “trigger” to ensure jobseekers continue to engage with the system. But critics argue compliance has become automated, grown increasingly harmful and places too much power in the hands of privatised agencies. Past requirements that jobseekers made genuine attempts to find work have given way to prescriptive “box ticking”, inhibiting individualised support, they claim. Acoss, which will appear at the inquiry on Wednesday, will release new analysis showing 65% of jobseekers in the Workforce Australia system received a payment suspension in the March quarter. For the highly disadvantaged cohort who are connected to a job agency, the figure was 75%. Past data has found homeless people, First Nations people and those with disabilities are overrepresented. Tull argued the privatised system combined with mutual obligations was what “enables so many providers to get by without delivering decent services for people, because people don’t have any choice”. “So mutual obligations and privatisation go hand in hand.” In its submission to the parliamentary inquiry, chaired by the Labor MP Julian Hill, the CPSU called for a “modern” Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). The CES operated from the postwar period until it was shut by the Howard government. “Part of the theory for privatisation was that there would be a large number of community-based providers and competition between those providers would ensure good quality services for job seekers and value for money for taxpayers,” Tull said. “How the system’s developed, though, is it’s becoming increasingly centralised to a couple of major players dominated by for-profit multinationals.” A recent shake-up of job agency contracts completed last year by the Coalition significantly reduced the market share of some major for-profit providers, though many still dominate the system. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has signalled the government is looking to reform employment services, saying they aren’t “working to the extent that they should”. “Clearly, some of the system that’s been established by our predecessors is about ticking the boxes rather than providing that support,” Albanese said this week. The peak body for the employment services sector, the National Employment Services Association, has warned against a return to public provision, arguing the old system was far more costly and massively underperformed in its final years. “Contemporary employment services are significantly more sophisticated than the fundamental labour exchange service delivered by the former Commonwealth Employment Service,” it said in a submission. The CPSU says a new version of the CES would be updated for the modern economy and would sit alongside other specialised employment services provided by the non-profit sector. The government heeded the parliamentary inquiry’s recent recommendation to scrap the controversial ParentsNext program in the federal budget.</body>

    <head>An extra $1.3bn to upgrade Australia’s energy-inefficient homes might not do much – here’s what would help</head>
    <body>In the recent federal budget, it was announced that $1bn would be allocated to provide discounted loans to households to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes and replace gas appliances with electric ones. A further $300m was provided for states to upgrade the energy efficiency of social housing. This was intended to deliver on a promise the Albanese Labor government made in exchange for the Greens agreeing to caps on gas prices – in effect subsidising its cost below international prices. According to the government, the package “will focus on households that most need support, such as low-income households [and] renters”. The federal government observed in its budget papers that “Australian homes are largely inefficient – Australia ranks 58 out of 63 countries on energy use per capita”. Related: Households offered $1bn help in budget to install energy saving measures The $300m allocated to upgrading energy efficiency for 60,000 social housing properties is very badly needed. State governments have not shown themselves to be particularly enlightened landlords. Their tenants are consigned to housing which the federal government notes has some of the worst levels of energy efficiency in Australia. But what about the remaining 380,000 social housing properties – more than 85% – that remain untouched? In terms of the remaining $1bn to be allocated as loans, do we now expect renters to take out loans to upgrade their landlord’s properties? Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup One thing is for sure – very few landlords will take up these loans, because they don’t have to pay their tenant’s energy bills. Over many decades and across many countries, the universal experience is that landlords do not undertake energy efficiency upgrades unless they are required to by law. Yet even in the case of those who own their own home, providing them with loans is just a small part of an effective solution to our poor standard of housing. We already have government funding supporting loans for energy upgrades, and have for many years. The government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation has been providing funding to a range of lending organisations that provide discounted finance to build or buy homes with high energy efficiency ratings or to finance energy-efficient equipment and solar systems. If these lenders were being overwhelmed with demand, then the Clean Energy Finance Corporation could easily give them more. That’s because the CEFC can draw down on around $4.5bn currently sitting in its account with the Treasury, so there’s serious question marks about whether an extra billion will make much difference. Don’t get me wrong, provision of low-cost finance can be a useful tool in driving energy efficiency, but there are other policy tools, which receive a glancing reference in the budget, which are vastly more important. The issue though for politicians is that to use them effectively would require courage to take on entrenched interests in the real estate lobby and manufacturers who have failed to modernise their product offerings. The first step is we must raise awareness among the community about just how poorly Australian housing performs. This requires prominent energy rating labels to be applied to advertisements whenever a home is put up for sale or lease. Few people appreciate that a large proportion of Australian homes probably rate around two stars or less out of a 10-point scale. At present, such ratings are being rolled out on a voluntary basis (except in the ACT). A small number of high-performing homes will seek out a rating, and the remaining, vast majority of homes that perform badly will get no rating. Australian energy ministers agreed to roll out such a rating scheme on a mandatory basis back in 2004. But they then wilted under lobbying pressure from the real estate industry. Related: This builder used to be sceptical about green homes. Now he’s a convert In addition, we need to implement minimum energy-efficiency standards for rental properties. The ACT government has made a great start by recently requiring minimum ceiling insulation levels. But ideally regulations should encourage upgrades to heaters and water heaters, and the adoption of solar and batteries if we really want to help reduce energy bills for renters. Other state governments, in particular Victoria, are considering implementing new standards. However, they will need to show some spine when they come up against the inevitable threats of a scare campaign from real estate agents. The federal government could also help. Landlords receive very generous tax breaks for investing in property, which economists have pointed out over many years deliver little to no net economic benefit. The government has ruled out curtailing these tax breaks. But at the very least it could require that landlords’ properties meet a minimum standard of energy efficiency in return for receiving these tax breaks. This is where a loan program becomes useful. If landlords claim they can’t afford to undertake upgrades, government can point them to their discounted loans, plus the fact the interest expense is tax deductible. • Tristan Edis is a director with energy advisory firm Green Energy Markets</body>

    <head>NSW taxpayers to fund indemnity for 47 organisations against child abuse claims</head>
    <body>The New South Wales government has been forced to provide taxpayer-funded indemnity to 47 non-government organisations, including church bodies, to cover child abuse claims, as states and territories scramble to respond to the widespread withdrawal of cover by the private insurance market. Private insurers are now widely refusing to provide coverage for physical and sexual abuse to organisations working with vulnerable children in out-of-home care and youth homelessness services. The decision by commercial insurers to abandon the field, described by one state minister as “market failure”, was caused by reforms removing time limits on civil abuse claims, which prompted a wave of new cases. Governments fear that, without insurance, non-government organisations will simply cease providing critical care and homelessness services. That has prompted the urgent design of temporary indemnity schemes that allow governments to pay out child abuse complainants where an institution is unable to do so. Related: State governments forced to indemnify church bodies for child abuse due to insurance ‘market failure’ The situation threatens to leave taxpayers covering abuse claim payouts for church-linked bodies such as Anglicare, an arrangement that has angered survivor groups. The Queensland, Tasmanian, West Australian and New South Wales governments have all confirmed to the Guardian that they have been forced to offer indemnity for child abuse to non-government organisations. The NSW state government said it had struck indemnity deals with 47 providers of out-of-home care and youth homelessness services. Of those, five were faith-based organisations. NSW set up its temporary indemnity scheme as states and territories work urgently for a more permanent solution. The temporary scheme limits each provider to $5m, inclusive of costs such as defence costs, and is only available where organisations have been “unable to obtain insurance in the commercial market”. The scheme also only covers abuse that has occurred since 30 June 2017. “In the event the costs associated with one or all claims in the period exceed $5 million, the service provider will bear those costs above $5 million,” the scheme’s guidelines say. A Department of Communities and Justice spokesperson said the scheme will end at the end of this year and is only designed as temporary cover for out-of-home care and youth homelessness providers. “The scheme addresses the immediate risk to service delivery, while a sustainable long-term solution to the lack of insurance for PSA is identified and implemented,” the spokesperson said. “The NSW government relies on our non-government sector partners to deliver crucial [out-of-home care] and youth homelessness services to vulnerable children, young people and their families. “Obtaining insurance for PSA risks is a critical issue for OOHC and youth homelessness services in NSW, and nationally.” Providers are made to pay a fee to join the indemnity scheme. The WA government also confirmed it was “currently indemnifying impacted organisations within the out-of-home care and youth homelessness sector” until a longer-term solution can be found. The Tasmanian government confirmed to the Guardian it has only indemnified one organisation for child abuse. Queensland has indemnified 18, including Anglicare Southern Queensland and four other church or faith-based groups. States and territories have formed an inter-jurisdictional working group in an attempt to come up with a more feasible long-term solution. “Community Services Ministers across Australia have established an Inter-Jurisdictional Working Group to identify a long-term solution for physical and sexual abuse (PSA) insurance for out-of-home care and youth homelessness providers,” a WA department of communities spokesperson said. “In the interim, each jurisdiction is responsible for managing [physical and sexual abuse] insurance.” Victoria is not affected by the problem because since the early 2000s it has offered a state-funded program of insurance for community service organisations, including those providing out-of-home care and youth homelessness support. Related: Australia’s child abuse redress scheme will be opened to prisoners in recognition of trauma’s impact The indemnity schemes have prompted questions about the morality of allowing taxpayer-funded financial protection to institutions who have, in some cases, woeful records of allowing and covering up child abuse. Last week, the Blue Knot Foundation’s president Cathy Kezelman said taxpayers would be right to be “concerned that their money is being used to enable a powerful institution to effectively abrogate its responsibilities”. Queensland’s minister for children, Leanne Linard, said last week that the “market failure” in private insurance put critical services for vulnerable children at risk. She said it also risked leaving survivors without compensation. “If claims are made that providers are unable to meet, people who have experienced physical and sexual abuse miss out,” she said. “The market failure for physical and sexual abuse insurance for out-of-home care and youth homelessness services is a national issue and we are working with other states and territories on a range of options to achieve a longer-term solution.” In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

    <head>Good times roll on Central Coast no matter how fragile Mariners’ success is</head>
    <body>Since he landed in Australia, Jason Cummings has lived up to his reputation as something of a jester. But beyond the jovial nature and Joker-inspired tattoos adorning various parts of his body, the Central Coast striker has established himself among the A-League Men’s best. His arrival from Dundee in January 2022 passed without major fanfare but 17 goals in 26 appearances in a Mariners shirt, a Socceroos debut and a run out at the Qatar World Cup, have done much to change the narrative. Most recently, his strike against Adelaide proved decisive in a 2-1 win in the first leg of their semi-final at the weekend. Related: Mariners sink Adelaide in A-League Men semi to break playoff drought None of the Mariners players who took to the field on Saturday night could be said to have been in high demand when they arrived in Gosford. Some were cast off by previous teams. Many developed in an academy traditionally perceived as subsisting off scraps, not recruited to more resource-laden rivals. Others migrated from the youth ranks of other clubs, sensing a greater opportunity to play. The most experienced, goalkeeper Danny Vukovic, is 38 and back at the club which launched a decorated career. Yet their unheralded nature is exactly why this Mariners side feels so worth savouring. Over the course of two seasons, Nick Montgomery has become a coach who will not only give young players minutes, but actively give them scope to impact games and take on responsibility. His team works hard for each other, operates with unified intent in attack and defence, and possesses players that want to receive and operate with the ball in tight areas. Collectively, they play some of the best football in the league. In an age where, despite the existence of a salary cap, the gap between the haves and the have-nots appears to be increasing, the Mariners have turned surviving into thriving by simply getting the basics right. What they do doesn’t cost a lot of money but they make it work: finding talent unwanted or unappreciated elsewhere, bringing it into an environment that nurtures and develops it, and then putting it in a position to succeed on the pitch. Marco Túlio in action against Adelaide United in the first leg of the semi-final last weekend. Photograph: Mark Brake/Getty Images It is almost aspirational – shrewdness, belief and hard work overcoming material disadvantage. Started by Alen Stajcic and taken to a new level by Montgomery, it’s a run that harks back to the last time the Mariners won silverware at the end of the 2012-13 season. Under Graham Arnold, himself having arrived in Gosford with something to prove after a tumultuous spell with the national teams, the cash-strapped Mariners won that grand final with a squad featuring a blend of astutely-sourced veterans and youthful faces such Mat Ryan, Tom Rogic, Oliver Bozanic, Trent Sainsbury and Mitch Duke – all of whom would go on to become World Cup Socceroos. But therein lies the rub. Lean years soon came for that side; the difference-makers moved on, as did Arnold, and couldn’t be adequately replaced. Four wooden spoons in five years followed, as did the threat of collapse swirling over a team so bad they were almost relegated from a league with no relegation. It’s a tale that provides the best reason for the neutral observer to enjoy this modern Mariners outfit, because their form is laced with the knowledge of how fragile it is. The qualities that make them worthy of celebrating are the same that make their joie de vivre so precipitous. Related: Jordan Bos breaks A-League Men transfer record with move to Belgian club Teams like the Mariners can’t just outsmart their rivals once, they have to keep doing it time and time again. Lose one too many players in an off-season and get unlucky with the next academy cohort, or hit coal instead of diamonds the next time you go looking in the rough and things can turn in an instant. Montgomery has rapidly proved himself irreplaceable, which will be a bit of a problem when he eventually needs replacing. Ultimately, money might not always buy success, but it does bring a margin for error. To celebrate these Mariners is to engage in an act of tragic joy, watching on with the knowledge that the same circumstances that have birthed their current fortune is simultaneously the thing most likely to portend their doom; a likeable upstart rowing against the tide of the hyper-capitalist product that is modern football.</body>

    <head>Silicon Valley Bank’s former CEO tells Senate he is ‘truly sorry’ for collapse</head>
    <body>The former CEO of the collapsed lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has said he was “truly sorry” for what he called the “devastating” collapse of the bank that triggered the worst banking crisis since 2008. Speaking at a Senate banking committee hearing on Tuesday, Greg Becker said he believed the bank was responsive to regulator concerns about managing risk and working to address issues before an “unprecedented” bank run led to its failure. Related: Is the banking crisis coming to an end? As JP Morgan CEO notes, risks linger “The takeover of SVB has been personally and professionally devastating, and I am truly sorry for how this has impacted SVB’s employees, clients and shareholders,” he said. Becker was appearing alongside two executives from Signature Bank, which collapsed shortly after SVB. They maintained the bank could have survived had regulators not chosen to close it. California banking regulators moved quickly to shut SVB down on 10 March after depositors withdrew $42bn in 24 hours. Regulators closed Signature on 12 March after it also experienced liquidity issues following SVB’s collapse. Becker’s account contrasts with those of regulators and banking industry executives who blamed SVB’s leadership for failing to manage interest rate risks or diversify the bank’s business beyond the highly concentrated tech sector in the Bay Area. Becker said he did not believe “that any bank could survive a bank run of that velocity and magnitude”. The Senate banking committee chair, Sherrod Brown, said the bank had repeatedly ignored warnings of “glaring risks” from federal and state officials. “We know your banks were fatally mismanaged,” Brown said. “When you put other people’s money, and our broader economy, at risk, there must be accountability for that level of mismanagement.” Becker, along with Signature Bank’s former co-founder and chair Scott Shay and former president Eric Howell, were appearing publicly for the first time since their firms collapsed, triggering a rare government intervention to backstop deposits.

    <head>Michael Gove says Tories will not win election with culture wars</head>
    <body>Conservatives need to recognise that elections are won on economics and public services rather than culture wars, Michael Gove has said in what will be seen as a rebuke to Suella Braverman. Addressing the National Conservatism (NatCon) conference in Westminster, a day after Braverman gave a highly partisan speech to the same event which condemned “experts and elites” and “political correctness”, Gove was at pains to make no direct criticism of the home secretary. But asked in an onstage interview whether Conservatives needed to engage with such issues, Gove highlighted what he said were the virtues of “gentleness and stability and discourse”. He said: “I think that the overwhelming majority of people in this country prefer civility. This goes to the whole question of the so-called culture war that is raging at the moment. “There are certain principles you should defend, absolutely. And it is absolutely critical that we don’t deny biological reality or that we don’t feel that we should apologise for aspects of our past, which are genuine sources of pride. “But we should do so with the self-confidence that means we don’t need to be strident.” Gove, the communities secretary, said the changing media and social media landscape had helped increase the prominence of culture war issues. “The way in which algorithms work tends to drive people towards poles, and the way in which particular sections of the media work means that they tend to become echo chambers,” he added However, he argued, voters were far more likely to judge parties and governments on other areas. “I actually think that economics is still central,” Gove said. “When it comes to the boring and vulgar task of winning general elections, and the even more boring and even more dispiriting task of government, the most important thing to do is to concentrate on the right economic policies, the right policies for public service delivery and so on.” Gove’s words are a polite rebuttal of the increasing tendency of some Tories, as highlighted by the NatCon gathering, organised by a rightwing US thinktank, to take more overtly combative approach to subjects like race and sexuality, and to borrow ideas from populists such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Giorgia Meloni of Italy. Braverman devoted much of her speech to railing against what she said was an attempt by the left to devalue Britain’s heritage, while Tory MP Miriam Cates said “cultural Marxism” was one reason for the UK’s falling birthrate. Gove, who was at pains to praise Braverman’s call for a reduction in legal migration numbers, said such divergent views were “a sign that our party and our broader movement is healthy, that you can have debate”. However, he did stress the need for “recognising what is distinctive and cherished in Britain and in the United Kingdom”, amid a conference which has seen other speakers praise Orbán and Donald Trump, and describe a supposed plot by leftwing groups to eradicate democracy. “In some of the commentary that there has been around national conservatism, I think people are trying to suggest that this is somehow an attempt to import American ideas, American ideology and American conservatism into the UK,” Gove said, saying this should not be the case. He also gently dismissed the idea of another argument by a Tory MP, Andrea Jenkyns, at a grassroots Tory conference on Saturday, that many of her party colleagues would fit better in the Liberal Democrats. Gove said: “The coalition government was five fascinating years, but I can’t think of a single Conservative who reminds me of Chris Huhne.”</body>

    <head>CBI appoints chief people officer as it aims to ‘rebuild trust’</head>
    <body>The scandal-hit Confederation of British Industry has appointed a “chief people officer” in an attempt to overhaul the lobby group’s internal culture after a series of sexual misconduct allegations reported by the Guardian. Elizabeth Wallace, a former headhunter for BlackRock, will take up the new role as part of the CBI executive committee and will report on workplace conduct and culture issues directly to the board. The CBI said Wallace’s appointment was the latest in a series of “decisive steps to rebuild trust in the CBI’s culture and purpose”, having also appointed the business ethics consultancy Principia Advisory to help overhaul its operations earlier this month. The lobby group is embarking on a wide-reaching turnaround plan as it tries to regain the trust of its members. More than 50 large businesses, including John Lewis and NatWest, suspended or cancelled their membership last month after the Guardian’s publication of a series of allegations of sexual misconduct. Those allegations included a woman’s claim that she was raped by a manager during a 2019 summer boat party on the River Thames, and a second allegation that a separate woman was raped by two male colleagues when she worked at an overseas office of the CBI. The lobby group said Wallace would start by implementing the 35 recommendations put forward by the law firm Fox Williams, which held an independent investigation into allegations of misconduct at the business lobby group and outlined ways that the group could improve its culture and management. While the CBI has paused its formal operations, it is preparing itself for an extraordinary general meeting on 6 June, when it is expected to try to regain the trust – and substantial fees – of former members. The CBI director general, Rain Newton-Smith, said Wallace’s role “will be integral in reforming our people strategy – defining our shared values as we collectively recover from the challenges of recent weeks. With over two decades’ worth of experience, I’m confident that her guidance will accelerate our efforts to effect meaningful change across the CBI.” Newton-Smith has already hinted at plans to rename the CBI as part of a group-wide revamp. The director general herself is part of that overhaul, having taken over from Tony Danker, who was sacked in April after separate allegations of misconduct were made against him, unrelated to the allegations of rape. After his dismissal Danker told the BBC he felt he had been “the fall guy” for allegations unrelated to his own conduct and that his reputation had been “trashed”. Wallace said she was delighted the board trusted her to “lead the way on cultural transformation here at the CBI”. • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732). Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html</body>

    <head>Derby still searching for its headline act with Dettori’s mount not finalised</head>
    <body>There are seasons when the Derby betting revolves around one horse, and others when we wake up on the first Saturday in June with no clear idea of what the favourite will be, never mind which horse will come home in front. The 2023 running of the world’s most famous Classic could still be the former rather than the latter, but time is running out. As things stand ahead of the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday, the final leg in the traditional cycle of Classic trials, there are just three names at single-figure odds in the ante-post Derby betting and none can offer what could be described as cast-iron credentials. Related: The targeting of Epsom is open to debate – but the right to peaceful protest is not | Greg Wood The narrow favourite, almost by default, is Charlie Appleby’s Military Order, who is a full brother to Adayar, Appleby’s Derby winner in 2021, but ended up running his Epsom trial on the all-weather after Lingfield’s track was waterlogged. Next in the list is Auguste Rodin, a deeply disappointing 12th of 14 in the 2,000 Guineas but apparently still Aidan O’Brien’s leading candidate, while none other than Frankie Dettori expressed doubts about whether Arrest would handle Epsom on quicker ground after their win on soft going in the Chester Vase. Jessica Harrington’s Sprewell, a convincing winner of the Derby Trial at Leopardstown on heavy ground this month, has also staked a claim for consideration, but the Dante will provide the last chance for a horse – and, perhaps, its jockey – to seize control of the narrative in the run-up to Epsom. Worcester 1.40 Who Is That 2.15 Wick Green 2.50 Ted’s Gift 3.25 Almazhar Garde 4.00 Trolley Boy 4.35 Extraordinary Man 5.05 Harry Gulliver 5.35 Hillsin York 1.50 La Yakel (nb) 2.25 Lucky Man (nap) 3.00 The Astrologist 3.35 Gather Ye Rosebuds 4.10 Ramazan 4.45 Mashadi 5.15 Val Bassett Newton Abbot 2.05 Inferno Sacree 2.35 Oakley Dancer 3.10 Doctor Foley 3.45 Begin The Luck 4.20 Danton 4.55 Crypto 5.30 Our Nel Bath 5.10 Symbol Of Hope 5.40 Haatem 6.10 Wedgewood 6.40 Damascus Steel 7.10 Further Measure 7.40 Mc’Ted 8.10 Pink Lily 8.45 War Chant Perth 6.00 Banjaxed 6.30 Fostered Phil 7.00 Ginger Pointe 7.30 Rae Des Champs 8.00 Cardboard Gangster 8.30 Steely Addition 9.00 Sanosuke The identity of Dettori’s final Derby ride was always going to be the subject of intense speculation after his announcement over the winter that the 2023 Flat campaign would be his last. Arrest is the clubhouse leader after his Chester success, but John Gosden, who retains him as No 1, is a big fan of the Dante having landed it with his two Derby winners to date, Benny The Dip and Golden Horn. Epictetus, successful over 10 furlongs of the Derby trip in Epsom’s Blue Riband Trial last month, is the Gosden stable’s only runner in a 12-strong Dante field, and could yet be Dettori’s Classic partner if he wins with sufficient conviction to suggest that stamina will not be an issue next month. His 11 opponents, though, include several lightly-raced types that could also march towards, or even take over at, the top of the market with an emphatic success. Canberra Legend, unraced at two, is unbeaten in two starts this year and currently 16-1 for Epsom, alongside Flying Honours, three-from-five at two and Appleby’s only runner in the race. White Birch, the Ballysax Stakes winner in a strong time, is another fascinating contender for John Murphy’s small yard in County Cork. In equine terms at least, this year’s Derby is still searching for its headline act. It may eventually turn out to be simply the horse with Dettori on its back. Or it could yet be a colt that, even now, is still on offer at double-figure odds – and the best action heroes always arrive just in the nick of time. Gather Ye Rosebuds excellent bet to land Musidora Jack Channon has made an impressive start to his training career after taking over the licence at the historic West Ilsley Stables from his father, Mick, and his filly Gather Ye Rosebuds is an intriguing contender for the Group Three Musidora Stakes, Britain’s last major trial for the Oaks, on the opening afternoon of York’s Dante meeting on Wednesday. Gather Ye Rosebuds is one of three in the eight-strong field that would need a supplementary entry to run in the Classic, but showed more than enough to justify a run in a trial when pulling nearly 10 lengths clear of her field on debut in a maiden at Newbury last month. The going that day was heavy, which probably exaggerated her superiority, but Gather Ye Rosebuds stayed on strongly to win in a very smart time under the conditions. Gather Ye Rosebuds was an easy winner of the Dreweatts Maiden Fillies’ Stakes at Newbury. Photograph: Ian Headington/racingfotos.com/Shutterstock She arguably achieved as much, if not more, than Sir Michael Stoute’s Infinite Cosmos, the likely favourite on Wednesday and current second-favourite for the Oaks, did in a similar race at Newmarket’s Guineas meeting. Channon’s filly, though, is nearly three times the price. Novakai, beaten a length in the Group One Fillies’ Mile in October, sets a fair standard, but Gather Ye Rosebuds (3.35) is just 6lb behind her already according to Timeform’s ratings and is an excellent bet at around 6-1 to progress from her debut form on Wednesday’s better ground. York 1.50 William Haggas has won this with lightly-raced four-year-olds for the last two years and La Yakel has a near-identical profile. Newton Abbot 2.05 Inferno Sacree has found his calling as a front-runner at sharp tracks and has fair prospects of a fifth win from six starts. York 2.25 Track, trip, draw and conditions all look ideal for Lucky Man, whose form figures in York sprint handicaps last year were 2-2-1-5. Worcester 1.40 Who Is That 2.15 Wick Green 2.50 Ted’s Gift 3.25 Almazhar Garde 4.00 Trolley Boy 4.35 Extraordinary Man 5.05 Harry Gulliver 5.35 Hillsin York 1.50 La Yakel (nb) 2.25 Lucky Man (nap) 3.00 The Astrologist 3.35 Gather Ye Rosebuds 4.10 Ramazan 4.45 Mashadi 5.15 Val Bassett Newton Abbot 2.05 Inferno Sacree 2.35 Oakley Dancer 3.10 Doctor Foley 3.45 Begin The Luck 4.20 Danton 4.55 Crypto 5.30 Our Nel Bath 5.10 Symbol Of Hope 5.40 Haatem 6.10 Wedgewood 6.40 Damascus Steel 7.10 Further Measure 7.40 Mc’Ted 8.10 Pink Lily 8.45 War Chant Perth 6.00 Banjaxed 6.30 Fostered Phil 7.00 Ginger Pointe 7.30 Rae Des Champs 8.00 Cardboard Gangster 8.30 Steely Addition 9.00 Sanosuke York 3.00 The ever-popular Highfield Princess tends to need a pipe-opener so Australian-trained The Astrologist, placed in Group One company at home and in Dubai, could have her measure.

    <head>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried ‘let me see everything’ for new book, says Michael Lewis</head>
    <body>Michael Lewis, the bestselling author of The Big Short and Flash Boys, will tell the story of the cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried in his next book, saying the alleged fraudster “let me see everything”. Sam Bankman-Fried, also known as SBF, became the world’s youngest billionaire before the age of 30, having founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. At one point he considered paying off the entire national debt of the Bahamas so he could take his business there. Then his net worth suddenly evaporated in 2022, and shortly afterwards he was arrested in the Bahamas and was subsequently extradited to the US on charges including wire fraud and money laundering. Bankman-Fried could be sentenced to up to 115 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Related: US charges Sam Bankman-Fried with bribing Chinese officials Going Infinite: the Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon by Michael Lewis will be published on 3 October, and is described by its publisher Penguin Press as a “high-octane story of the enigmatic figure at the heart of one of the 21st century’s most spectacular financial collapses”. Author and financial journalist Michael Lewis was there when it happened, having got to know Bankman-Fried during his rise to wealth. “This book came about in an unusual way: I didn’t go looking for Sam Bankman-Fried, and he didn’t go looking for me,” he told the Guardian. “A friend of mine came to me and said, ‘I’m thinking of doing this massive business deal with a person I don’t know. He’s called Sam Bankman-Fried. Nobody knows him, he’s come out of nowhere. Forbes says he’s worth $23bn, he’s 29 years old … I’ve seen you sit down and make sense of all these other people: make sense of him for me.’” Lewis agreed, Bankman-Fried visited him at home and the pair went on a hike together. “At the end of the hike I turned to him and said: ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen to you, I don’t know where your story is going, I’ve never seen anything like this.’ I just thought to myself I wanted to be a fly on the wall and he said yes. And to this day he’s never limited my access.” There were “two things that have been peculiar about writing this book”, Lewis said. “One was, he’s let me see everything. When it all comes crashing down last November it’s literally me, his parents and his therapist. And I can hang around as long as I want, see whatever I want. And this is the other odd thing. Not only has he never sought to control anything I think, or anything I might write, he’s never even asked: what are you doing? He has just allowed me freedom, a freedom which is really unusual, especially given the circumstances, to just try and understand him and his situation.” It has been “an unusual literary exercise”, he added. “It’s almost as if I was attached to a character who was insistent on generating a beautiful work of fiction for me in real time, in the real world, and allowing me to watch.” “Sam Bankman-Fried was worth billions; now, he’s worth nothing. And still nobody really knows anything about him,” said Tom Penn, Lewis’s editor at Penguin Press. “Nobody, that is, except Michael Lewis, who was by his side as it all happened, and who leads us deep into the mind and world of a figure whose phenomenal rise and jaw-dropping fall encapsulates our dizzying, disorientated age. It’s compulsive, revelatory, edge-of-your-seat storytelling by one of the greatest chroniclers of our times – and his biggest story yet.”</body>

    <head>Netflix warns UK broadband firms of crackdown on password sharing</head>
    <body>Netflix has warned telecoms companies including Sky, Virgin Media and BT to brace for a potential backlash from customers who view its films and TV shows through their services, as the streaming service prepares to crack down on the widespread practice of password sharing that allows millions of British homes to watch for free. Netflix, which is getting tougher with password sharing as one of a number of moves to increase profitability amid slowing rates of new subscriber growth, has estimated that about 100m homes that pay for its service globally share their passwords with friends and family. The world’s biggest streaming service, which has already begun to crack down on password sharing in regions including Latin America, New Zealand, Spain, Portugal and Canada, is expected to start targeting British subscribers in the coming weeks. Related: ‘It was apocalyptic’: Tim Richards of Vue on cinema’s collapse and comeback About a quarter of the UK’s 15 million Netflix subscribers, almost 4m homes, allow others to use their service for free, according to the research firm Digital i. Netflix intends to get paying customers to set a primary location, and when their account is used in other areas the account holder will be warned. They will be encouraged to sign up for a “paid sharing” model, designed to get the free users added for a few extra pounds a month. The company has held talks with partners that bundle its service with their own TV and broadband packages – such as Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media and BT – to warn them of the impending crackdown, in a move first reported by the Financial Times. Telecoms companies are likely to receive calls, chat and email queries from some customers about the potential curbs to usage that they have become accustomed to sharing for free. “There may initially be a bit of kneejerk reaction from some subscribers,” the Digital i managing director, Matt Ross, said. “We have seen a drop in viewing per account in Spain where Netflix has already started to crackdown on password sharing. The question is what the overall impact will be on subscriber numbers in the long term.” Spain has a much higher rate of password sharing than the UK, with 39% of Netflix users sharing their login. Earlier this year, Netflix moved to delay the wider rollout of its password sharing crackdown from the first three months of the year to the April to June period after the company noticed a “cancel reaction”. However, Netflix said that after an initial dip subscribers soon started adding “extra member” accounts, citing Canada where the paid subscriber base has grown since the launch of the “paid sharing” initiative. “Based on what we have seen in markets where Netflix has rolled out its plan so far there hasn’t been a huge amount of consternation among the subscriber base,” Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere, said. “Netflix has had plenty of time to test this. It is not too uneconomical to upgrade to add more people, we don’t see large numbers of people furious about not being able to access Netflix for free.” Netflix has also responded to the cost of living crisis by launching a new pricing tier, at £4.99 a month in the UK, which includes advertising for the first time. Netflix, Sky, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Sky and BT declined to comment.</body>

    <head>Are you a doctor who hates treating gay people? Come to Florida, where Ron DeSantis has legalised bigotry</head>
    <body>You know what I love about living in the US? Freedom! You can choose between multiple overpriced insurance companies to provide you with healthcare, for example. The healthcare companies, in turn, can seemingly charge you whatever they like for their services. If they want to charge you $1,500 (£1,200) for some toenail fungus cream, that is their prerogative. That’s freedom, baby. As if this wasn’t glorious enough, the healthcare system in Florida has just had a new layer of freedom added to it. On 1 July, a new law goes into effect that means a doctor can look a potential patient up and down, decide they are giving off homosexual vibes and refuse to treat them because interacting with gay people goes against their personal beliefs. The doctor will not face any repercussions for denying care and has no obligation to refer the patient elsewhere. I wish I was exaggerating but I’m not. Last week, Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, signed the Protections of Medical Conscience (pdf) bill, which lets medical professionals and health insurance companies deny patients care based on religious, moral or ethical beliefs. While the new law doesn’t allow care to be withheld because of race, colour sex, or national origin, there are no protections for sexual orientation or gender identity. The only bright spot is that hospitals must still abide by federal laws that require them to stabilise a patient with an emergency condition. In other words, you can’t let a patient die just because they’re wearing a Drag Race T-shirt. At least, I don’t think you can: it is hard to say precisely what is allowed under this new law because, like a lot of regressive Republican legislation, the bill is deliberately vague. It does not list which procedures are acceptable to refuse and it doesn’t clearly define what constitutes a “sincerely held religious, moral, or ethical belief”. This lack of clarity is by design: Republicans love passing legislation with vague language because it creates confusion and is more difficult to challenge. It is also a lot scarier for the people affected when you don’t have a clear idea what is allowed and what isn’t. The journalist Mary C Curtis has called the tactic “intimidation by obfuscation”. The American Civil Liberties Union noted that the new law means “Floridians will have to fear discriminatory treatment from medical providers every time they meet a new provider, calling into question everyone’s trust in their medical care.” DeSantis has been a very busy man: in the brief moments he has not spent fighting with Disney, his state’s second-largest employer, he has been signing a flurry of regressive legislation. The day before he signed his bill attacking healthcare equality, he signed a draconian immigration bill that makes life for migrants in Florida very difficult. And, on Monday, he signed a bill that would ban Florida’s colleges and universities from spending state or federal money on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. It also limits how race can be discussed on many courses. In a speech after he signed the bill, DeSantis told prospective college students that if they want to study wacky things such as “gender ideology” they should get the hell out of Florida. “We don’t want to be diverted into a lot of these niche subjects that are heavily politicised; we want to focus on the basics,” said DeSantis. Sounds like a great advert for Florida’s educational institutions, doesn’t it? “Come here if you just want to learn the basics!” I’m not sure what “the basics” are but they clearly don’t include studying Michelangelo or watching animated films since, earlier this year, a Florida principal had to resign after parents were outraged that their kids were shown a picture of Michelangelo’s David and now a Florida teacher is being investigated for showing her class a Disney movie featuring a gay character. Having banned everything in sight, DeSantis’s next big project appears to be modifying Florida’s “resign-to-run” law so that he can run for president while still serving as governor. It’s not clear when he might finally announce his candidacy, but I will tell you this: it is looking very likely that the Republican nominee for 2024 is going to be either DeSantis, a man who has turned the sunshine state into a hotbed of bigotry, or Donald Trump, a fellow bigot who has been found to be a sexual predator by the law.

    <head>Rapper Slowthai appears in court charged with rape</head>
    <body>Slowthai, the chart-topping rapper who has received nominations for a Grammy award and the Mercury prize, has appeared in court on two charges of rape. The 28-year-old appeared before Oxfordshire magistrates court via video link on Tuesday charged with oral and vaginal penetration of a woman without her consent in Oxford in September 2021. He spoke only to confirm his real name of Tyron Frampton, date of birth, and an address in Northampton. The prosecution lawyer Adam Yar Khan told the magistrates that the charge of rape was an indictable-only offence and the case must be heard at crown court. Frampton was bailed to appear before Oxford crown court next month. Slowthai was nominated for best dance recording at the Grammy awards in 2021. His second album, Tyron, reached No 1 in the UK charts that year. His first album, Nothing Great About Britain, was nominated for a Mercury prize in 2019 and reached the Top 10. Slowthai’s stage name combines a reference to his slow speech in childhood with a homonym of an abbreviation of his first name.</body>

    <head>Home Office to fast-track thousands of Iraqi and Iranian asylum claims</head>
    <body>Up to 20,000 Iraqi and Iranian asylum seekers are to have their claims fast-tracked by the Home Office in a renewed push to clear a backlog, a leaked letter shows. In a significant move to meet Rishi Sunak’s pledge to deal with more than 90,000 claims submitted before last June, claimants from the two countries will be asked to fill in detailed questionnaires in English before facing shortened interviews with officials. If a positive decision can be made on the basis of the evidence available, a personal interview may not be required. If a claimant fails to comply with the process, their claim could be withdrawn. The move follows a similar scheme launched in February that asked 12,000 claimants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria, Yemen and Libya to fill in detailed 11-page documents or risk refusal of their claims. Sunak has declared clearing the asylum backlog as one of his top priorities, and pledged last year to clear the backlog of 92,601 asylum cases submitted before June 2022 by the end of this year. At the end of 2022 there were 11,698 Iranian cases and 8,909 Iraqi cases in the legacy backlog, out of a total of 132,000 applications. The grant rate for Iranian claimants is 80%, and for Iraqis it is 54%. The move has been cautiously welcomed by a leading immigration lawyer. However, campaigners have called for the government to reassure people seeking asylum that their claims will not be withdrawn if they fail to submit documents on time. In a letter sent to stakeholders on Monday, the Home Office said it was launching “a new phase in the programme to clear the legacy backlog” by grouping the remaining outstanding legacy claims together into cohorts, which will allow claimants to “either be called for a substantive interview or be sent a questionnaire and called for a targeted or shorter interview”. It said: “As part of this approach, the first cohorts we will prioritise are legacy claimants from Iran and Iraq, as these are the two highest nationality cohorts of outstanding claims. Iranian and Iraqi legacy claimants who have not yet been substantively interviewed will begin receiving questionnaires which will be tailored to their circumstances over the next few weeks, helping to reduce the duration of any subsequent interviews. “Once the necessary information is received, we anticipate that targeted or shorter interviews will be approximately 30 minutes to two hours in length.” Claimants will have a total of 30 working days to return their English-language questionnaire, the letter said. “If they fail to comply with the asylum process through non-attendance at an asylum interview without a reasonable explanation, their claim may be withdrawn,” it added. Officials have told the Guardian that many of the questionnaires issued to people claiming asylum from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria, Yemen and Libya have not been filled in properly, leaving officials still needing to carry out lengthy interviews. A report in the Times last week claimed that just 10% had been filled in properly, making the fast-track scheme largely redundant. Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister and author, welcomed the streamlining of Iraqi and Iranian claims but warned that the new scheme could be premature if the problems of previous questionnaires persisted. “It looks like good news but premature if they haven’t sorted out the easy cases already,” he said. “And it is not clear how this is going to help with more complex cases. Most asylum interviews are about two to three hours anyway so there’s not much of a time saving if they’re at the upper end of their time estimate.” Sile Reynolds, the head of advocacy at the campaign group Freedom From Torture, which is taking legal action against the Home Office over the threat of withdrawal of claims if questionnaires are not returned on time, said the government had given assurances that no claims had so far been withdrawn. “We remain concerned that rolling out this policy without further safeguards, including access to legal representation, an interpreter or a full face-to-face interview, could result in survivors of torture being refused protection and returned to their home countries to face persecution,” she said. The Home Office said: “We need to make sure asylum seekers do not spend months or years living in the UK, at vast expense to the taxpayer, waiting for a decision. This questionnaire will help us clear the backlog of historic asylum cases by speeding up decisions and allowing case workers to carry out shorter, more focused interviews. “Individuals who receive one, like all asylum seekers, are subject to mandatory security checks against their claimed identity, including immigration and criminality checks on UK databases, which is critical to the delivery of a safe and secure immigration system.”</body>

    <head>Prince Harry begins second legal case against Home Office over personal security</head>
    <body>A decision to not allow the Duke of Sussex to pay for police protection while in the UK was unlawful, his lawyers have claimed, as he launched a second legal challenge against the Home Office over his security arrangements. At a high court hearing in London, lawyers for Prince Harry argued he should be given the go-ahead to bring a case over the decision of the executive committee for the protection of royalty and public figures (referred to in court papers as Ravec) that people should not be allowed to pay privately for their protective security. Lawyers for the Home Office argued it was not appropriate for “wealthy people” to be able to “buy” specialist armed police protective security. The duke’s lawyers said the decision by Ravec was inconsistent with the 1996 Police Act which allows the “chief officer of the police” to provide special police services “subject to payment”. Harry’s renewed case is related to an earlier attempt to challenge the decision that he would no longer be given the same degree of personal protective security when visiting the UK after stepping back as a working royal and moving to the US. Shaheed Fatima KC, for Harry, said the case raised an “important issue of principle”. She said the argument relied on by Ravec, “that allowing payment for protective security is contrary to the public interest and will undermine public confidence in the Metropolitan police Service”, could not be reconciled with the fact that parliament had expressly allowed for payment for such services. She said Ravec had not provided any principled or rational basis for drawing a distinction between the provision of protective security for those individuals within the Ravec cohort, who, according to the funding decision, “are not permitted to privately fund protective security, and other private individuals, who could privately fund protective security, by making a request to the chief officer of police”. She told the court: “Ravec had exceeded its authority, its power, because it doesn’t have the power to make this decision in the first place.” Matthew Butt KC, for the Metropolitan police, told the court such specialist policing exposed officers to “unique risks” and that Ravec decided what was in the public interest. “It cannot be right that officers are expected to expose themselves to that level of risk not in the public interest but because the policing body has been financially compensated,” he said. “That can only be justified with public interest.” In written submissions, the Met said it was “wrong for a policing body to place officers in harm’s way upon payment of a fee by a private individual”. The judge, Mr Justice Chamberlain, asked if there was a difference between someone seeking special policing for a private event on private land, such as a festival, a celebrity wedding or football match – and that of a bodyguard. Harry’s lawyer said it was not a case of a bodyguard, it was “protection at a particular location”. Harry has claimed the decision by Ravec was unlawful, unreasonable, and that he was not given an opportunity to be consulted prior to the decision being made. Robert Palmer KC, for the Home Office, said this was not about crowd control at a football match or marathon or other similar event; it was about specialist protective security for an individual. He said Ravec’s decision was not unlawful and it was “simply the setting of a policy principle”. There was legal uncertainty over whether the provision of protective security fell under the relevant section and the Police Act. He said in written submissions: “The funding decision arose because … the claimant suggested, in connection with his first judicial review, that he was, or might be, it being unclear, willing privately to fund the protective security he sought, supplied by the Metropolitan police service.” He added: “In essence, Ravec considered that it was not appropriate to support an outcome whereby wealthy individuals could ‘buy’ protective security from specialist police officers (potentially including armed officers), in circumstances where Ravec has determined that the public interest does not warrant that individual receiving such protective security on a publicly funded basis. That would be precisely the effect of the claimant’s claim.” Ravec, which he said includes senior officials from the Home Office, the Met and the royal household, was not required to give Harry the chance to make representations, Palmer said. He added: “Given the nature of the arguments now advanced by the claimant, the court can be confident that such representations would have been highly likely to have made no substantial difference in any event.” He said the funding decision “does not preclude any individual, including the claimant, from applying to any chief officer directly and seeking to persuade them to provide protective security as a special police service. “The fact … that the MPS has set out in its summary grounds that such an application to it would be likely to be refused is, practically, unsurprising where the MPS was represented on Ravec and agreed with the concerns of principle set out in the funding decision.” The case is among five other civil cases the duke is pursuing through the courts in London. The judge will give his ruling at a later date.</body>

    <head>Gucci show reaffirms Seoul’s status as capital of pop culture</head>
    <body>Baggy jeans, luxury handbags, K-pop heart-throbs and a 14th-century palace starred in a lavish Gucci catwalk show that highlighted Seoul’s status as a centre of pop culture and a key battleground for luxury brands. A famous Seoul backdrop and the strong influence of the city’s street style in the collection were the biggest fashion statements of the night. The 14th-century Gyeongbokgung Palace, the command post and fortress of the Josean dynasty, is symbolic of Korean power and pride. The first fashion show to be held in its ceremonial courtyard reflects how South Korea’s rise to soft-power superpower has put this city at the heart of the fashion industry – and that Gucci, which entered the South Korean market 25 years ago with the opening of a boutique in Seoul, is keen to maintain its high profile. South Koreans spend an average of $325 (£260) on luxury goods each year, the highest per capita of any country, according to research by Morgan Stanley investment bank. Even more significant for brands is the halo effect of association with Korean culture. The rise of K-fashion follows K-pop and K-drama, as the country’s culture-first approach to world domination continues to shape the 21st century. Netflix recently announced a $2.5bn investment in Korean-language content, with the chief executive, Ted Sarandos, saying South Korea “represents the cultural zeitgeist”.

Photograph: Monic/Gucci Gucci, which has pledged an undisclosed donation for the restoration and preservation of a landmark also known asthe Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven, arrives in Seoul hot on the heels of Louis Vuitton, which collaborated with the Squid Game director, Hwang Dong-hyuk, for a show held on the city’s Jamsugyo Bridge last month. The electrifying energy of South Korea was channelled into a collection that tipped its hat to contemporary and traditional South Korean dress. Bomber jackets and cargo pants were accessorised with the ultimate streetwear It-bag: a Gucci skateboard with a logoed laptop pouch tucked between the wheels. In contrast, the empire-line, pebble-smooth curves silhouette of the traditional Korean hanbok were echoed in a scuba crop top worn with a high-waisted full maxi skirt. For seven years until the sudden departure of the designer Alessandro Michele last year, Gucci set the style pace, championing of a gender-neutral and vintage-curious maximalist aesthetic which dramatically moved the fashion needle. An interregnum is in place until the new designer Sabato De Sarno, poached from the ultra-chic Valentino, will present his first collection this year. The collection shown in Seoul was a joint effort by the design studio. Clues as to the direction Gucci may be heading could be taken from the nods to Tom Ford’s impressive reign at Gucci that were scattered through the show. Silk satin blouses, square-toed heels and minimalist horsebit clutches recalled his 1995 debut for the house. Music came courtesy of Jung Jae-il, who composed the score for Parasite, the winner of Korean’s first Oscars, and Squid Game, while A$AP Rocky played at the afterparty. The actor Dakota Johnson was joined in the front row by the Squid Game actor Lee Jung-jae. But the guest of honour was the brand ambassador Hanni of the girlband NewJeans, which recently set a K-pop record by reaching 1bn Spotify streams 219 days after the release of their first single. That Hanni’s NewJeans bandmates Minji, Danielle and Haerin have signed deals with Chanel, Burberry and Dior respectively reflects the might of K-pop as fashion currency.</body>

    <head>Jofra Archer out of Ashes after recurrence of elbow stress fracture</head>
    <body>Jofra Archer will miss a third successive summer, and a second successive Ashes series, after scans revealed a recurrence of a stress fracture to his right elbow. The England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed the news when announcing the squad for next month’s one-off Test against Ireland, for which Jonny Bairstow returns after recovering from a triple leg break and will take the wicketkeeping gloves from Ben Foakes, who has been left out altogether. Rob Key, the ECB’s managing director for men’s cricket, said Archer was “pretty distraught” about his latest setback, which was confirmed after the bowler’s premature return from the IPL last week. It is the third time the 28-year-old has suffered the injury, which appeared first in January 2020 and then again the following August, while he sat out last summer with a stress fracture to his lower back. Related: Leicestershire offer parable for English cricket: teams should serve, not just sell | Jonathan Liew Though it is much too early put a timescale on Archer’s recovery from an issue that Key said had “baffled quite a few of the specialists that have been involved” England have not yet given up hope he could be involved in this year’s 50-over World Cup, which is five months away. Key said he had “no concerns at the moment” about Ben Stokes’s fitness for the Ireland Test, which starts at Lord’s on 1 June, noting that while England’s captain has been at the IPL he has been so infrequently involved that “he’s actually been getting more rest than he would have done had he been doing anything else”. Bairstow will keep wicket and bat at seven, returning as a straight replacement for Foakes, a decision the selection committee “agonised over for quite some time”. The Surrey player is understood to have taken his exclusion badly, but Key was encouraging about his chances of returning to the side in future, potentially for this winter’s Test series in India. “He’s pretty upset about the fact that he lost his place. He wants a few days to get his head around it,” Key said. “I certainly don’t think this is the end for Ben Foakes. What you want to do when you play for England is show that you’re good enough to play at that level and he has shown exactly that in abundance.” Ollie Pope has been named as vice-captain, the first time anyone has officially taken that role since Stokes was appointed as captain last April. The announcement reflects the player’s growing status within the group, but the timing also seems notable given that the state of Stokes’s left knee increases the chances of him being forced from the field during two intense months of Test cricket. Ben Stokes (Durham, captain), Jimmy Anderson (Lancashire), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Harry Brook (Yorkshire), Zak Crawley (Kent), Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire), Dan Lawrence (Essex), Jack Leach (Somerset), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Matthew Potts (Durham), Ollie Robinson (Sussex), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Mark Wood (Durham). Jimmy Anderson is named despite the minor groin strain he suffered last week with the bowling ranks including Chris Woakes, who missed most of last summer with a knee injury and last played for the Test side 14 months ago, and Mark Wood, who is on paternity leave as he awaits the birth of his first child.</body>

    <head>It’s the nation’s favourite cocktail – Phil and Holly on the rocks. Sickly sweet at first and then quite sour</head>
    <body>Phillip Schofield’s This Morning career is lying in state on a catafalque and the queue to view it currently runs to 10 miles. Yet still they come. What a testament to the guy’s particular qualities. Then again, when the loathed Hollywood executive Harry Cohn died back in the 1950s and 2,000 people attended his funeral, a comedian remarked: “It only proves what they always say – give the public what they want to see and they’ll come out for it.” To the perennial snakepit of daytime television, then, with ITV’s morning magazine drawing the rubberneckers on Monday, as former bezzies and co-presenters Phil and Holly Willoughby “battled on” despite reports of a serious rift. Schofield has done hilariously mad things over the past week, like hire crisis management and issue a statement about their amazing friendship and professional partnership. Holly … hasn’t. Are they really on the rocks? Yes, would seem to be the obvious answer, with many viewers convinced they could feel the tension on Monday’s programme. That said, these daytime shows often have the feel of a hostage video. I can’t see how you would possibly be able to act like you believed in segueing from an item warning about Alzheimer’s to a chicken traybake recipe unless there was some guy standing just off camera drawing a scimitar menacingly across his throat. But we’ll come to show editor Martin Frizell in a minute. The one thing we can all live without hearing any more about is Holly and Phil’s “professionalism” for carrying on. FYI, commentators: most of the country works every day with people they can’t stand, so spare us the medal ceremony for a pair who pull in £730,000 each for doing it only four days a week. As for why Phil and Holly are on the rocks, who can say? Or rather, who can say in print? For now, a recap of only the barest bones of this saga. Despite being watched by an average of about a million viewers, the stewardship of the This Morning sofa is being written about 30 times more feverishly than the stewardship of less important places like the Foreign Office, and 50 times more feverishly than the fact a former cabinet minister is now on record saying openly that the Conservatives sought to “gerrymander” by insisting on voter ID for elections. Yup, This Morning matters – really matters – and the fact that a story about Holly and Phil was the most read bit of news on the Guardian website for a large part of Monday can only be a testament to that significance. (Needless to say, I have read every word.) ‘Monday found Holmes twinkling: ‘I think there should have been a special award for Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby for best actors.’’ Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford presenting This Morning in 2020. Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock But the plotlines are byzantine and in some cases still obscure. Take just one knotty strand of it all. Friday’s This Morning used to be presented by Eamonn Holmes and his wife Ruth Langsford. Back in December 2019, it was reported that Ruth had made an official complaint about Phil – a stand she was supported in by Phil’s former occasional co-host Amanda Holden, who stated: “I admire anyone who sticks up for themselves as it’s not an easy thing to do. There is a tin opener and a can somewhere, and other people have found the opener.” Unclear what happened to Ruth’s complaint – but when, soon after, Phil suddenly decided to come out as gay, he did so on a This Morning presented by Ruth and Eamonn, who were then shown hugging him and holding his hand. Holly was in supportive attendance. Yet Holmes now seems quite pleased to see the pair under the hammer. Eamonn presents a breakfast show on GB News, and is not remotely bitter – never is, missy, never is – though Monday found him twinkling: “I think there should have been a special award for Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby for best actors.” Well now. I don’t think we can even begin to get our head round all the angles of that timeline. Forget it, Jake – it’s daytime. Related: This year’s Eurovision was a political statement – whatever the organisers may have wanted | Zoe Williams Further highly called-for perspective came courtesy of olden days polo-neck-of-shame wearer Dapper Laughs, who on Monday tweeted a photo of himself staring pensively out of a train window with the caption: “Sat thinking about how ITV dropped me over a joke and Schofield’s still on there.” And a field day too for my favourite future Royal Society fellow, “body language expert” Judi James, who comes straight off a coronation rentaquote bonanza to parse Monday’s This Morning and declare that one moment “gave Phil the body language advantage in what looked like a bravado fight-back, because by the time he turned to Holly her signals of self-diminishing were making her look anxious and sad”. God love Judi. I always order the word salad and am never disappointed. Backstage gossip from the show also tends towards the scenery-chewing, with editor Martin Frizell reportedly observed forgoing his usual spot in the gallery while the show was on air, to instead sit in the canteen with “a face like thunder”. The Boswell of all this seems to be former breakfast TV side table Dan Wootton, now a GB News presenter and committed prose stylist, who currently starts a new article about Holly and Phil four minutes after finishing the last one. He ended his MailOnline column on Monday with the thunderous verdict on the latest edition of This Morning: “This felt like the daytime TV equivalent of the last days of Rome.” Mm. Like Dan himself, that line works better as a joke. And, of course, as a passionate student of history, Professor Wootton will know that by some estimates the last days of Rome dragged on for 200 years. Two whole centuries of corruption and catamites and caving to the barbarians at the border. Luckily, ITV doesn’t face such grave problems.

    <head>Zelenskiy’s Europe tour was a success, but west’s latest gifts may not be enough</head>
    <body>Even by Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s standards, the Ukrainian president’s high-speed trip around Europe’s principal capitals was successful. A trip to Berlin extracted a commitment to supply €2.7bn more arms, Paris offered more troop training and light tanks, and London stumped up pilot training and long-range drones. The ongoing supply of western weapons is what gives Kyiv its best hope of kicking out the Russian invaders, a point underlined by Moscow’s overnight bombing of Kyiv. Eighteen out of 18 missiles apparently aimed at US-made Patriot air defence systems were knocked out and casualties appear to be minimal. It is not certain how Ukraine shot back but, with supplies of missiles for its local S-300 and Buk systems running short, it is likely to be western equipment, whether US-Norwegian NASAMS, a Franco-Italian SAMP-T, Germany’s IRIS-T or the two Patriot systems from the US and Germany that began arriving in the country in mid-April. But the question remains: is Ukraine getting enough arms to have a chance to win the war decisively? A partial answer will come whenever Ukraine launches its already anticipated counterattack, although wisely, Zelenskiy was saying “we really need some more time” as he met Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, at Chequers on Monday. Some of the latest European gifts are for use now. Most notable are the cache of British Storm Shadow missiles, announced last week, just before Zelenskiy’s tour. They most likely number a few dozen, whose range (likely to be over 300km) makes anywhere in Russian-occupied Ukraine a target. But most of the latest promises are for later this year. That means, in military terms, the deeper meaning of Zelenskiy’s tour was that whatever has been promised by the west may not yet be enough – and that it is necessary to secure a pipeline of future supply from Europe throughout 2023, in case the initial phase of the counterstrike underwhelms or misfires. Germany’s promise of a gift of €2.7bn worth of weapons essentially matches the UK’s existing commitment to provide £2.3bn this year. It reconfirms the Zeitenwende (times-turning) foreign policy announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz shortly after the start of the invasion, and Zelenskiy’s presence in Berlin shows that after months of initial frustration with the slow pace of arms delivery, relations are now positive. More interesting, though, was the quiet emphasis on the need for Ukraine to secure new fighter jets in the UK and France. Absent on this trip was Zelenskiy’s showmanship, or public diplomacy. In February, on a previous trip to the UK, the Ukrainian leader asked for “wings for freedom” in an address at Westminster, handing the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, a pilot’s helmet to underline the point. That was accompanied by an unlikely demand for European Typhoon jets – never thought ideal for Ukraine’s needs – which has long been quietly dropped. This time, Zelenskiy talked in a more low-key way at the Chequers country retreat about building a “jets coalition,” meaning an effort to gently persuade the White House to green-light the gift of US-made F-16s. Sunak immediately pronounced himself on board, committing the UK to help with “training of pilots and all the logistics” to build up a cadre of pilots ready to fly an F-16. Overnight, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had seen Zelenskiy between Scholz and Sunak, said his country was also involved: “We have opened the door to training pilots, and this with several other European countries.” Scholz, however, dodged the question when it came up at a press conference in Berlin, and, at least for now, the US shows no sign of changing its stance. But Nato’s next annual summit is due in mid-July (and a G7 meeting is coming at the end of the week), which may help concentrate the minds of the reluctant. It is not obvious that Ukraine’s small surviving air force can survive a long war. European military backing will not alone be enough for Kyiv to defeat the Russian invaders, given that the largest single contributor, by some distance, is the US. Washington has pledged $36.9bn in arms since the full invasion began in February 2022, including a further $1.2bn a week ago. But at a time when the re-emergence of Donald Trump reminds Kyiv that full-throated US support cannot be guaranteed after the next presidential election, shoring up key European allies ahead of the early summer round of international summits makes good strategic sense.</body>

    <head>What can I do with bitter green peppers?</head>
    <body>Supermarket packs of peppers always include a green one – nasty, bitter things that I only use in minestrone. What else can I do with them? Mel, Evesham, Worcestershire This is all too familiar to Luis Gonzalez-Castro, founder of London-based Cuban supper club Cocina Cuca, who “doesn’t love their raw, bitter flavour, either”. That said, green peppers have always featured in his family’s cooking, so Gonzalez-Castro has “learned to appreciate them” – and you can, too, Mel! The road to recovery might start with aji relleno, a favourite of Gonzalez-Castro’s father: “He cuts the tops off a few peppers, gently coats in olive oil, then fills with picadillo [a mix of mince, herbs, raisins and olives].” Into the oven they go and, “oddly, the results are astounding. The peppers soften in the steam and, together with the sweetness of the raisins and saltiness of the olives, the bitterness evaporates.” Another who suggests that Mel should, er, get stuffed is Maunika Gowardhan, pepper enthusiast and author of recently published Tandoori Home Cooking: “My mother would do this with spicy, crushed potatoes, and it’s so good,” she says. First heat some oil in a pan, “stir in asafoetida, cumin seeds, green chillies, ground coriander, chilli powder, and turmeric, then add [boiled and] crushed potatoes and season.” You’ll also want some mango powder “for tang” and chopped coriander, before piling the lot into halved green peppers brushed with oil and grilling them. “They still have some bite when you cut into them, but you get this lovely, charred flavour.” Skewers are another contender to cure a green pepper plight. These, Gowardhan suggests, could be threaded with murgh malai tikka (for which chicken is marinated in the likes of garlic, ginger, chilli, malt vinegar and yoghurt) or with paneer (“infused with saffron, cardamom and fennel”) alongside sliced green peppers: “They help secure the meat or paneer, while also adding even more flavour.” Eggs, as ever, are another good shout: “An omelette is a very good way to use green peppers,” says chef, restaurateur and Guardian contributor José Pizarro. “Caramelise onions in olive oil, then stir in [sliced] potatoes and peppers, add plenty of salt and pepper, and fry.” Tip in beaten eggs and cook until they just start to set. Flip (with the help of a plate), cook on the other side for a few minutes more and you won’t notice any bitterness, Pizarro says reassuringly. Then there’s that perennial weeknight saviour, the stir-fry. “If you’re using soy and honey to get that sweet-savoury mix, green peppers make a lovely addition,” says Paul Ainsworth, chef-owner of The Ainsworth Collection in north Cornwall. Otherwise, throw caution to the wind and lean into the bitterness, he says: “Peppers can add flavour and body to the right dishes because of their slight bitterness – they’re great in a green tomato chutney, for instance.” Miguel Barclay, author of the One Pound Meals series, meanwhile, goes a step further: “Make a dish that can’t be made without them – something that uses their unique taste as an advantage: a Sloppy Giuseppe pizza, say.” And if all else fails, he adds, deploy covert tactics. “Hide them,” he says, with sauces being the obvious vehicle: “In Mexican salsas, perhaps, or put softened green peppers in salsa verde or chimichurri – they add a beautiful, earthy tone, and the salsa hides those bitter notes that so many people hate.” Got a culinary dilemma?

    <head>‘It was apocalyptic’: Tim Richards of Vue on cinema’s collapse and comeback</head>
    <body>Tim Richards is celebrating a milestone he feared he might not see – the 20th anniversary of the creation of Vue, Europe’s largest privately owned cinema chain. That achievement looked precarious in the pandemic, when the world’s biggest cinema operators were pushed to the brink. “When it is your baby, your firstborn, going through this, it is very tough,” says Richards, who is in recovery mode himself, having “had an argument with a tree and lost” on a recent heli-skiing trip in his native Canada. “It has been apocalyptic,” he says of a period in which Covid forced the chain to close completely for a period starting in 2020. “You don’t run a [financial survival] analysis on full closure for a couple of years. My goal at the time was to save the company and jobs, and that wasn’t finally done until September. Only then did I know the company was going to be OK.” “OK” is, of course, relative. Since being founded on 13 May 2003 – after striking a finance-stretching £250m deal to buy Warner Village UK’s 36 movie theatres, transforming Vue into the Britain’s second-biggest chain overnight – Richards and his backers have enjoyed a string of lucrative deals in which Vue has been acquired by new owners over the past two decades. However, his most recent life-saving deal – a £1bn restructuring in January that wiped out the value of the equity held by Vue’s owners and the 26% stake held by management – was not one of those moments. “I personally lost a lot of money,” says Richards. “The goal was to save everyone who helped build the company: we have 5,000 employees here and 9,500 across Europe, and nobody was let go, so I think we succeeded in that. We’ve got a cleaned-up balance sheet, we’ve got new money in, and we haven’t abandoned a single site.” While the World Health Organization officially heralded the end of Covid as a global emergency this month, the health of the global cinema industry remains fragile. London-listed Cineworld, the world’s second-largest chain, is battling to exit bankruptcy protection in the US, having been unable to finance a $5bn (£4bn) debt pile. And the market value of AMC, the world’s largest chain and owner of Odeon in the UK, continues to languish at just a third of its pre-pandemic level. Tim Richards: ‘Covid actually proved that the cinema model is not broken.’ Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer “My view hasn’t changed: the next 12 to 18 months is going to be a period of consolidation,” says Richards. “A lot of companies are for sale – such as in Australia, the Middle East and France. A number of high-quality chains that are struggling post-pandemic are up for sale. We are not out of the woods yet.” For Richards, who took the almost-obligatory look at Cineworld’s assets when a US bankruptcy process forced its owners to at least consider a sale, risking losing everything in pursuit of success is part of his makeup. The son of a Canadian trade commissioner, he spent the first 10 years of his life in Brazil before leaving school in his teens to pursue his dream of being a world-class downhill skier, with the aim of making the Canadian Olympic team. He spent three years dedicated to the cause, working on oil rigs to pay for coaching, before eventually realising he wasn’t going to quite make the grade. “Technically I’m a high school dropout,” he says. “I tried very hard and left school to train full-time. If I hadn’t tried for the Canadian dream, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.” He returned to education as a mature student, gaining a degree in political science and economics, followed by law school, which led to a job at the major law firm Freshfields in mergers and acquisitions. However, the recession of the early 1990s meant M&amp;A work was thin on the ground: “It was a great job, I loved the firm, but there was nothing to do.” A job ad in the Financial Times for a role at an unnamed studio would ultimately change his life. After 11 interviews, Richards landed the post at UCI, a cinema chain joint-venture between the Hollywood studios Paramount and Universal, and by the mid-1990s he had gone full Hollywood, moving to Los Angeles in a business development role for Warner Bros. Seeing his employer’s cinema chain, Warner Village, described as a “non-core asset” in parent company Time Warner’s 1998 annual report provided him with his next risk-it-all moment. “The writing was on the wall,” he says. “I saw what studio life was like. I thought I could do something different and for a fraction of the price.” Richards, whose first experience of film on the big screen was sneaking into a cinema in Rio de Janeiro as a seven-year-old and seeing To Kill a Mockingbird, managed to raise enough money to buy six cinemas. The first opened in Livingston, Scotland, in 2000, but Richards always had his eye on making a deal for Warner Village; three years later he did, stretching his business to near-bankruptcy to form Vue. “I went from a garage to a small office above a Greek restaurant in Chiswick through to where we are today,” says the indefatigable 64-year-old. “And I have no intention of slowing down.” Indeed, the slow lane is not a place one would expect to find Richards: he is about to indulge his love of motorsport, competing in a Lamborghini in a race at a forthcoming event at Silverstone. “I’ve probably got one year left in me because I am still racing against 17-year-olds,” says Richards, who obtained his racing licence back when he was living in California. These days based in London, he lives with his wife, Sylvie, whom he met at law school, and has three children – none of whom work in the glitzy world of film. “None of them have followed me into the business,” he says. “I think it is important to carve your own path and find your own way, which they are all doing very successfully.” And as for the business of cinema, it is slowly but surely getting back to full steam. While this year will still see about 20% fewer releases than pre-pandemic, and the UK box office is forecast by analysts Omdia to come in around £200m below 2019’s record levels, next year is expected to be almost back to business as usual – the impact of the current screenwriters’ strike notwithstanding. The almost-funereal atmosphere that pervaded in the industry during the pandemic, when Hollywood studios bypassed cinemas with digital releases direct to fans, has dissipated, as that great experiment proved commercially unsuccessful for most films. Richards points to an almost-complete volte-face – with even streamers Apple and Amazon committing $1bn annual budgets to making films for big-screen release – as proof cinema is back. “Covid actually proved that the cinema model is not broken,” says Richards, who has one eye on a Hollywood-style comeback for Vue in the form of a potential stock market flotation in the future. “The audiences are there. They never left us.”</body>

    <head>Joe Biden ‘re-evaluating’ Australian trip where he had been invited to address parliament next week</head>
    <body>Joe Biden is re-evaluating his plan to visit Australia next week, where he had been due to address the Australian parliament as the first US president in nearly 10 years to speak to a joint session of MPs and senators in Canberra. Officials had confirmed that Biden would make the speech on Tuesday 23 May, the day before he attends the Quad summit in Sydney with the prime ministers of Australia, Japan and India. However on Wednesday morning the White House revealed they were considering cancelling the entire Australian visit as a result of the deadlock in negotiations with Congress to raise the US debt ceiling. Biden is still confirmed to travel to Hiroshima for this week’s G7 meeting, however “we are re-evaluating the rest of the trip right now”, White House spokesman John Kirby said, including the Australian leg. He said Biden would still meet Albanese at the G7, as well as India’s Narendra Modi, but it was “prudent and reasonable for the president to look at the rest of the trip and evaluate whether it makes sense”. “These leaders, all leaders of democracies … they know that our ability to pay our debts is a key part of US credibility and leadership around the world,” Kirby said. “And so they understand that the president also has to focus on making sure that we don’t default.” Kirby said Biden was able to do “both things”, to travel overseas and also work with congressional leaders. He emphasised he was not “teasing” a cancellation but simply explaining what was going on and that a decision would be made “relatively soon”. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Tuesday he was pleased that Biden had taken up his invitation to address parliament, an honour also afforded to Barack Obama in 2014. “This will be the fifth joint address to the Australian parliament by a US president and demonstrates the warmth, depth and strength of the Australia-US Alliance,” the Australian government said in a statement. Related: Joe Biden to visit Australia in May as Sydney hosts 2023 Quad leaders’ summit Albanese and Biden would also have a bilateral meeting focusing on “elevating global climate ambition and accelerating the clean energy transition”, the statement said. While officials step up their preparations for the Quad summit and numerous side events, the Australian government is warning of “barriers” in implementing the Aukus security partnership with the US and the UK The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, will say in a speech on Wednesday that the full ambition of Aukus will only be realised if the transfer of technology and information between Australia and the US is “seamless”. Much of the initial focus has been on Australia’s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, starting with buying three to five Virginia class boats from the US in the 2030s. But Aukus is also meant to trigger broader collaboration on advanced defence technology, such as artificial intelligence, hypersonic weapons and undersea warfare. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian government’s budget last week allocated $148m over four years towards what are known as the Aukus “pillar 2” projects. In a keynote address to the American Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide, Marles will say the government is “focused on developing asymmetric technologies that will help deter future conflicts”. But Marles will say that technology transfer barriers in the US and Australia “are vast and complex”. That includes export controls in the US known as international trafficking in arms regulations (Itar). Marles will say Australia has been having “productive” conversations with the US, including the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, about Itar “and how we can translate that shared understanding and positive intent into action”. Related: Aukus: nuclear submarines deal will cost Australia up to $368bn “We are encouraged by the momentum we’re seeing at all levels across the Australian and US to overcome these hurdles,” Marles will say, according to speech extracts released by his office. “But we need supportive voices in business to keep this momentum going. “Your role in building the seamless defence industrial base between our countries is pivotal, because improving technology transfer and information sharing between the US, the UK and Australia is at the heart of maximising the full potential of the Aukus agreement.” Albanese most recently met Biden in March in San Diego, when they were joined by the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to announce details of the submarine project. There had been speculation that Biden might have to alter his planned travel to the region because of a standoff over the debt ceiling in the US – but the Australian leg of the trip was confirmed on Tuesday. Albanese said he was looking forward to hosting the Quad leaders’ summit at the Sydney Opera House on Wednesday 24 May, describing it as “the largest, most significant gathering in Australia since we hosted the G20 a decade ago”. He will also have a bilateral meeting with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the two leaders will speak at a community event in Sydney. A meeting between Albanese and the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, will be the pair’s seventh to date. Prior to the Quad events, Albanese will travel to Japan for the G7 summit in Hiroshima from Friday to Sunday.</body>

    <head>‘Manifestation of a crisis’: Wellington hostel fire puts spotlight on dire state of New Zealand housing</head>
    <body>Hours after firefighters finally put out the blaze, smoke was still rising from the roof of the Loafers Lodge in Wellington, and the smell of burning remained. Firefighters guided a drone through the clear skies, trying to calculate the extent of the building’s collapse, while the bodies of at least six people lay inside the hostel’s walls, unable to be retrieved. On the top floor, the ageing brown exterior was stained black by smoke, the paint blistered and peeling from the heat, with windows smashed out and empty. It was from these fourth floor windows that Tala Sili jumped, realising that his only options were to take the fall or die in the flames. Leaning on crutches outside an evacuation centre in Newtown he described the fire’s heat, its flames made invisible by thick, acrid smoke. Related: ‘Pressures have built up’: how can New Zealand solve its social housing crisis? “It smelt like poison,” he told national broadcaster RNZ. “I was on the top floor and I couldn’t go through the hallway because there was just too much smoke so I jumped out the window,” he said. “It was just scary, it was really scary.” At least six people have been confirmed dead, and eleven remain missing after the fire ripped through the hostel in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The complex had more than 90 rooms, each equipped with the barest of facilities: a bed, a heater, a desk. The Loafers Lodge is one of a network of hostels, motels and boarding houses that are home to some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable communities: those on sickness and disability benefits, elderly people, the previously homeless, ex-prisoners, those deported under Australia’s “501” deportation policy. Homelessness charities in the city have confirmed they had at least 40 clients registered to the address, which had acted as housing for highly vulnerable people. Situated just a block away from Wellington city hospital, the lodge had also become home to a number of nurses and hospital employees, who were unable to find accommodation in the capital city’s competitive housing market. ‘If there’s a fire it’s like a rabbit warren’ Conflicting reports have emerged from residents over whether alarms went off when the fire broke out; some said they were woken by the alarms but that they came after a number of false alerts, while others said they did not hear them at all and were woken instead by the yelling of other residents. Fire and emergency said on Tuesday that they could not confirm whether alarms had gone off. “The alarm[s], they keep going every week, two times, three times,” resident Tamrat Isse Adan said. Wrapped in a white shawl and speaking to a cluster of reporters outside the evacuation centre, Adan said he escaped with nothing but a jacket and phone. “I’m very sad, very sad. My neighbour, he’s missing, maybe he’s dead, police say there’s a lot of people missing,” he said.

Older buildings like this one are exempt from having to retroactively fit sprinkler systems in the way that new buildings must – even when they house many people, including elderly people and those with complex health needs or disabilities. Wellington City Council said on Tuesday evening that the Loafers Lodge was issued with a Building Warrant of Fitness in March this year, indicating that it met minimum safety standards at the time. “I often used to think when I used to visit: God, if there’s a fire it’s like a rabbit warren,” said one hospital worker, who knew a number of nursing and hospital staff who had lived there over the years. She said it was also a place to house at-risk people, or discharge patients who did not have other places to go. “It was used for people who needed accommodation that couldn’t otherwise find it or afford it – people with disabilities, physical, psychological,” she said. “People that have had poor mobility … people on emergency housing lists”. As police and emergency services launch into an investigation of the fire’s causes and spread, prime minister Chris Hipkins said there was “no question” that the fire also raised wider, ongoing issues of tenuous housing around New Zealand. “There will always be a group of people though who are in more transient housing,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to protect them.” For some, fury is growing alongside questions of how the fire could have occurred – and what it says about New Zealand’s care for its most vulnerable people. “What kind of country are we that we allow this kind of thing to happen?” said Green party leader James Shaw, speaking to parliament on Tuesday afternoon. “What kind of country are we where those people have so few options in life, but to live in substandard accommodation, with a reasonable chance of lethality?” A firefighter walks through the scene after a fire at Loafers Lodge Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images New Zealand’s housing crisis – caused by unaffordable property prices, a chronic shortage of state housing, and sky-high rents in major cities – has created waitlists for emergency housing almost 30,000 people long. The government’s policy has been to place people in motels and hostels, but what began as a temporary stopgap has become a long-term solution, with families’ time in these facilities stretching out to months or years. By the start of 2023, 3,336 households were living in short-term, emergency accommodation, including more than 3000 children. Nearly 500 of those households had been there for over a year, and more than 120 had been there for more than 2 years. The policy has been enormously costly: over the course of 2022-2023, payments made by the government to these private motels and hostels were about $1m a day. Conditions in many of New Zealand’s transient housing facilities are grim, violent and unstable. In recent years, there have been numerous media reports of violence, intimidation, drug trades, sexual violence and robberies at emergency, transitioning or temporary housing facilities. The Loafers Lodge had been used as one of those sites by the ministry of social development between 2017 and 2020, according to Ministry of Social Development data. The minister in charge, Carmel Sepuloni, said on Tuesday morning that the hostel was no longer contracted to the ministry – but it remained part of a wider, less formal network of temporary accommodation. “For me it’s about the New Zealand government for the last eight years shoving people in a place that’s got walls and saying they’re housed,” said Filipa Payne, from Route 501, an organisation that advocates for New Zealanders deported from Australia under that country’s controversial section 501 law. Many of them arrive in New Zealand with no work, no financial support, and no family connections to the country – and crash immediately into transient accommodation like the Loafers Lodge. Payne said she was in contact with two 501 deportees living at the hostel who had escaped the fire, but others were still unaccounted for. For housing activists, this tragedy more than a single building, but reflects a wider system of social neglect and crippling housing shortages. “This calamity is a result of a seriously defunded, unplanned and privatised housing system,” said Heleyni Pratley, spokesperson for advocacy group Public Housing Futures. “We do not have enough houses for people. “The government immediately came out and said this is not an official emergency housing provider [but] even if it’s not officially emergency housing, it functions as such. This is a complete tragedy, but also a manifestation of a crisis, a breaking point.”</body>

    <head>Air pollution transparency rules among EU laws to be scrapped by UK</head>
    <body>Laws to ensure the government is transparent about how they plan to reduce harmful air pollution are among those to be scrapped in the EU retained law bill. A climbdown by ministers over the bill has reduced the number of EU regulations to be automatically removed from the statute books from 4,000 to 600, but key rules on air pollution are among those still expected to be removed. The regulations being taken out of UK law impose a duty on the government to publish a pathway to meeting tight emissions targets by 2030 for five noxious pollutants. The rules also enforce the need to publicly consult on the plans to cut emissions. But these two regulations, in the National Emission Ceilings Regulations 2018, are to be removed from UK law by the end of the year if the bill, which is going through the House of Lords, is approved. Katie Nield, a clean air lawyer for ClientEarth, said: “They are proposing to snip out some quite critical elements that are there to make sure the targets are actually met. They want to remove the legal duty on government to have a plan to reduce the emissions, to frequently revise that plan and to publish it, and they want to remove the need to put that out to public consultation. “The duty to produce a pathway to meet the targets is a critical tool to make sure the government explains what it is doing and to hold them to account. It raises major alarm bells. It is hard to see how this move could be anything other than a strategy to skirt accountability.” The government’s pathway to reduce emissions had to be revised under the regulations this year because it was in breach of emission reduction targets for fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is classified as a cause of cancer. The pathway is also not on track to meet emissions reduction targets by 2030 for four out of the five air pollutants from transport, agriculture and industry – nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, PM2.5, ammonia and non-methane volatile organic compounds. Air pollution poses one of the greatest environmental risks to health, according to the World Health Organization, which estimates that in 2019 outdoor air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide “The fact that the government will no longer have to publish its plan, revise it and consult on it in the context of their current plan not on track to meet the targets, is really concerning,” said Nield. More than half of the 600 laws set to be removed by the end of the year relate to the environment. Greener UK, a coalition of environmental groups including the RSPB, National Trust and Friends of the Earth, called on the government to remove at least two of the laws due to be chopped – relating to water and air quality. The group said there was a strong chance that new post-Brexit UK laws, intended to replace EU-era rules on environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for water resources, were still being consulted on and would not be in place before spring next year. Peers have tabled amendments to be debated on Wednesday to remove these regulations relating to water and air pollution from the bill. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We remain committed to the retained EU law bill receiving royal assent and ending the supremacy of EU law, with unnecessary and burdensome EU laws removed by the end of this year. We are unequivocal that reviewing our retained EU law will not come at the expense of the UK’s already high environmental standards and environmental protections will never be downgraded.”</body>

    <head>Oxford University cuts ties with Sackler family over links with opioids</head>
    <body>The University of Oxford will cut its ties with the Sackler family, whose wealth came from addictive opioid drugs, removing the family’s name from buildings, galleries and positions funded through their donations. The university’s governing council approved the measure to strip the Sackler name from two galleries in the Ashmolean Museum and a university library as well as several staff positions, following an investigation earlier this year by Oxford’s new vice-chancellor, Prof Irene Tracey. The move follows sustained criticism of Oxford’s retention of the names, as major institutions such as the British Museum and the V&amp;A removed Sackler titles after recognition that the funding was connected with the family’s ownership of the now bankrupt Purdue Pharma, manufacturers of the addictive OxyContin painkiller. Related: British Museum removes Sackler family name from galleries The university said: “Oxford University has undertaken a review of its relationship with the Sackler family and their trusts, including the way their benefactions to the university are recognised. “Following this review, the university has decided that the university buildings, spaces and staff positions using the Sackler name will no longer do so. These review outcomes have had the full support of the Sackler family.” As part of the decision, the Sackler library has been renamed the Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library. Three staff posts supported by the family’s donations will also drop the Sackler title, including the Ashmolean’s keeper of antiquities. The university also said that “all donations received from the Sackler family and their trusts will be retained by the university for their intended educational purposes. No new donations have been received from either the family or their trusts since January 2019.” However, the university will retain recognition of the Sackler gifts on a plaque at the university’s Clarendon building and on the Ashmolean museum’s donor board “for the purposes of historical recording of donations to the university”. Tracey, a professor of neuroscience who specialises in pain perception and anaesthetics, launched the review before the Financial Times revealed in February that the university maintained its links with the Sackler family, extending invitations to events such as the Oxford-Cambridge boat race, and continuing to accept donations even as Purdue became embroiled in legal action over its role in the US’s deadly epidemic of opioid addiction. In 2019 the Louvre in Paris removed the Sackler title from the museum’s oriental antiquities wing, while the Serpentine Gallery said it would no longer accept donations from Sackler trusts. Other institutions followed, including New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2021. Last year George Osborne, the chair of the British Museum, announced it would remove the Sackler name from all galleries, rooms and endowments supported by the family’s trusts, saying it was time to move “into a new era”.</body>

    <head>Little Bone Lodge review – Joely Richardson is scarily fierce in tense thriller</head>
    <body>This story is set in a farmhouse in present-day Britain, but its occupants – hypercompetent Mama (Joely Richardson), ailing Pa (Roger Ajogbe) and teenage daughter Maisy (Sadie Soverall) – live like they’re in the 1950s, with no mobile phones or landline, no TV and certainly no internet. Nevertheless, they seem content enough even if Mama is a bit overprotective of Maisy. Perhaps that’s due to the fact that Pa wouldn’t be much help in a crisis, given he uses a wheelchair and is nearly mute, heavily medicated with the painkillers that Mama dispenses on a strict schedule. It’s understandable that she would be hesitant to admit the strangers who come hammering on the front door in the middle of a ferocious storm, pleading desperately for help after they’ve been in a car accident. Maisy, who clearly doesn’t get out much, begs Mama to help them and soon the matriarch is performing surgery on the kitchen table, suggesting she’s not just the simple farmer’s wife she claims to be. Of course, the visitors aren’t the hapless travellers they claim to be either. Jack (Neil Linpow, also the film’s screenwriter) and Matty (Harry Cadby) are brothers who were involved in some kind of robbery, but the escape has gone wrong now that the car has crashed. Older brother Jack is the one who Mama operated on, and soon he’s unfeasibly mobile and ready to roll on after the removal of what looks like a significant length of rebar from his gut. When he and Mama go to the crash site to retrieve some vitally needed bags, highly strung and emotional Matty grows closer to Maisy; his recent confinement to a psychiatric institution comes out when they tune into Maisy’s secret radio and learn Matty is wanted for the murder of a nurse. All manner of shocking secrets about everyone come tumbling out, in what turns into a melodrama of familial dysfunction on an operatic scale. The core conceits, once they’re fully revealed, are somewhat credulity-stretching but somehow the cast makes it work, with a sturdy assist from director Matthias Hoene who turns up the tension with skill. Richardson, presenting as glamorous and scarily fierce, anchors the film with poise while Linpow holds his own and proves adept at making unnervingly realistic squeals and howls of pain. • Little Bone Lodge is released on 22 May on digital platforms.</body>

    <head>Bird flu could become the next human pandemic – and politicians aren’t paying attention</head>
    <body>Last month a pet dog in Canada died of H5N1, also known as bird flu, after eating a wild goose. Worryingly this follows a pattern, with an increasing number of bird flu cases appearing in mammals who come into contact with an infected bird, dead or alive. When you see a wild bird such as a duck or seagull, think bird flu. Because it’s actually more likely than not they’re infected with the virus. And many species of wild birds are asymptomatic, meaning that they don’t show any symptoms. The risk of transmission to pets is low, but they can get sick from chewing or eating an infected bird, whether it’s dead or alive. I first wrote about bird flu in November, when domestic birds in Britain were put into an indoor lockdown. The virus had become endemic in most wild bird populations. It’s incredibly infectious, where one bird could infect as many as 100 others. When infected wild birds encountered domestic birds (such as by flying over and defecating on them underneath), huge problems emerged. Avian flu has a near 100% fatality rate in most poultry, which led to shortages of not only turkey for Christmas but also eggs, as farm after farm was decimated by the disease. Since November, the signals emerging across the world continue to be worrying. In January and February this year, more than 3,000 sea lions died of bird flu in Peru (where the death toll in wild birds reached an estimated 50,000). In Russia, 700 Caspian seals died. Then several dolphins in Britain and the US died of H5N1. Normally, even if an animal catches H5N1 from a bird, it can’t pass it to other mammals. This limits its spread. But the large number of cases in these outbreaks suggest the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission, although this hasn’t been confirmed yet by genetic sequencing. A more likely hypothesis is that these outbreaks are groups of animals feeding on infected birds. It is not yet 100% clear what’s happening. But the risk of spread among mammals is ever-present. A new research pre-print from Canada showed that H5N1 samples could spread efficiently between ferrets with fatal outcomes. In order to spread efficiently to humans, H5 would need three major categories of genetic changes, according to bird flu expert Prof Richard Webby. So far, the virus has been able to make one of these changes, but not the other two. So right now, H5N1 is a theoretical risk for the next human pandemic, rather than one requiring urgency in response today. And a prime minister or health secretary might say, “Why prepare for something that might never happen?” Related: First birds, now mammals: how H5N1 is killing thousands of sea lions in Peru To those of us scientists working in global health, there are enough concerning signals that action should already be happening. So that if a certain set of mutations do occur and we see an outbreak in humans in Peru or China or Britain, that the harm it could cause is minimal. This is a disease with an estimated 50-60% fatality rate in humans, including children. The cornerstone of infectious disease preparedness is in: surveillance (to know what strain is spreading and where in birds); testing (to identify disease quickly in humans); vaccines (for protection against disease and death); and antivirals (to improve clinical outcomes). The US government is already moving in this direction. Rebecca Katz, professor at Georgetown University Medical Center, has noted that a H5 candidate vaccine virus recently produced by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is likely to provide good protection against the circulating H5N1 viruses. The information has been shared with vaccine manufacturers to start the process of stockpiling adequate doses. But this is a challenge because most influenza vaccines are created by incubating doses in chicken eggs (called egg-based production). If bird flu has killed off many of the chickens, then egg shortages are likely. There’s another H5N1 vaccine which is non-egg based, but they could have a maximum of 150m doses ready within six months. The world’s population is almost 8 billion. In addition, the FDA-approved antiviral treatments for seasonal influenza could also work against bird flu. But again, getting doses to all parts of the world is a challenge given shortages. Preparation must also involve appropriate PPE for healthcare workers to protect against a respiratory disease (flu) and diagnostics to quickly identify if someone is infectious in hospitals. All of these issues are solvable with precise planning, collaboration across countries, scientific ingenuity and good leadership. With post Covid-19 fatigue, the bigger problem is bringing the public along and communicating the facts so that they are trusted and believed. With so much – often understandable – mistrust in our current political leadership, authorities like chief medical officers and independent government advisers become crucial. At the moment most governments aren’t paying attention to bird flu: they’re more interested in another AI (artificial intelligence) rather than this AI (avian influenza), but the avian influenza threat is real, and needs much more immediate attention and preparation.

    <head>Stage-three tax cuts cost blowout predicted, with men and the wealthy to benefit most</head>
    <body>The cost of stage-three income tax cuts has climbed to $313bn over a decade, with the benefits flowing disproportionately to high-income earners and men, according to new data. New Parliamentary Budget Office costings, conducted for the Greens, has predicted a blowout in the cost of implementation. It has been released as the Albanese government insists it has no plans to revisit the controversial tax cuts. The cost of stage three has risen from $254bn in October due to lower unemployment, higher incomes and inclusion of an additional year in 2033-34. The PBO found that the tax cuts will cost $20.4bn in their first year, 2024-25, rising every year to $42.9bn in 2033-34. Interactive With the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, declaring Labor’s first full-year budget a balance between cost-of-living relief and inflation, the burgeoning cost of stage three has been a focal point for those who wished it had shown greater ambition in poverty reduction, including the independent MP Zoe Daniel and senator David Pocock. Related: The stage-three tax cuts are bad economic policy – and a dumb political strategy, too | Greg Jericho The cuts, passed by the Morrison government in mid-2019, remove the $120,000 to $180,000 tax bracket, increase the top tax bracket to $200,000 and reduce the marginal rate of tax for everyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000 to 30%. The PBO found that men will collect $203.7bn over the decade, or 65% of the benefit, compared with women, who will receive $109.4bn, or 35%. Over four years, men will get $45.8bn while women will get $23.4bn. Income earners in the top 20% are set to scoop up $227.6bn of the total $313.1bn benefit, as their incomes rise from $109,200 in 2023-24 to $155,600 by the end of the decade. The second-highest quintile of earners will receive a further $60.3bn. The middle quintile of earners will receive $23.1bn, the second lowest just $2.1bn and the lowest quintile will get nothing from the tax cuts because their incomes are projected to remain less than $45,000. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Although the government has repeatedly cited the benefit of returning bracket creep to low- and middle-income earners, the costings reveal those earning between $45,001 and $60,000 will get just $3.7bn – or about 1.2% of the benefit – over a decade. Those earning $60,001 to $90,000 will receive $25bn, or 8% of the total, while $157bn – just over half of the total cost over the decade – will flow to people earning over $180,000 a year. The PBO used de-identified Australian Taxation Office data from 2018-19, grown over the medium term using parameters in the 2023-24 budget for the estimate. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said that “Labor’s stage-three tax cuts for the wealthy are a massive black hole, sucking in money that should be spent on services for everyone”. The Greens spokesperson for economic justice, Nick McKim, said “the idea of giving $313bn in tax cuts to the wealthy instead of freezing rents, lifting Centrelink above the poverty line and building public and affordable housing is beyond disgraceful”. In budget week Chalmers deflected several questions about stage three by insisting they “haven’t actually been a focus of the deliberations for this budget at all”. Chalmers told Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast that the tax cuts “kick in at $45,000” and “it is actually a defensible objective” to try to return bracket creep – the increased tax take as incomes rise – back to people. The Grattan Institute has argued that while there is “some justification” to give back bracket creep, the stage-three cuts are “too big” and “overcompensate” for its effects. Retaining the 37% tax rate, which currently applies from $120,000, could save the budget $8bn a year, it proposed in April ahead of the budget. The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, told the podcast the Coalition supports “lower, simpler and fairer taxes”, praising stage three for allowing middle-income earners to “keep $0.70 of every [dollar] that they earn”. Hume said the cuts were a “really necessary reform” and accused the government of being “very noncommittal about this”. On Monday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, noted that Labor had tried to amend Coalition legislation to remove the stage-three tax cuts but was not successful. “It wasn’t just the Coalition by the way,” he told ABC Melbourne. “It was Jacqui Lambie and others in minority parties who voted for it.”</body>

    <head>Speaker at UK conservatism event echoes far right in attack on ‘globalists’</head>
    <body>One of the main speakers at a conference attended by two cabinet ministers and a series of other Tory MPs has blamed “globalists” for the world’s political problems, repeatedly using a term associated with the far right and antisemitic conspiracy theories. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a US thinktank, mentioned the idea, which has been condemned by Jewish groups as an antisemitic trope, more than a dozen times in his address to the National Conservatism (NatCon) event in London. Related: Why are terms linked to antisemitism being used at UK conservatism event? Roberts also likened Brexit to the views of Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis and Viktor Orbán, and said leftwingers wanted to end all democracy to impose their opinions on the world. While “globalist” can be a neutral term, its use as a term of abuse for over-powerful elites supposedly seeking global domination is closely associated with the far right and conspiracy theories about the extent of Jewish power. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, will address the event later on Tuesday, and Suella Braverman, the home secretary, spoke on Monday. Miriam Cates, another Tory MP who also spoke on Monday, used the idea of “cultural Marxism” in her speech, another concept linked with antisemitic conspiracy theories. Roberts repeatedly condemned what he called “the leftist control of globalist corporations and entities”, seemingly indicating this was part of a conspiracy to end democracy, calling this “the gathering storm”. “The new left, greedy, elitist, woke and globalist, has foresworn every principle their ideological predecessors once espoused: democracy, equality, diversity, justice,” said Roberts, whose thinktank is sometimes addressed by Conservative politicians in the US. “It abhors religion, and Christianity especially, as well as the nation state, political accountability and even objective truth. Their goal is not to win political contests but to end them altogether – to sweep away dissent and any subversive institution that dares facilitate.” He went on: “This new left is not in competition. It is at war with the west, with the moral, intellectual and social foundations on which our entire civilisation rests. Which is why it reserves a singular hatred for the kind of conservatism represented by Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, by Brexit, by Viktor Orbán and, yes, by this conference.” He explicitly praised the populism practised by people such as DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, and Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, saying UK politicians could follow their lead. Roberts argued: “The emergence of nationalism and populism on the right is a re-emergence. It’s a rebirth of the principles western conservatives de-emphasised over the last three decades, to their nations’ peril. “The great awokening and normalisation of anti-western, anti-Christian, anti-democratic, cultural totalitarianism in western newsrooms, classrooms and bureaucracies, and then of course the Covid lockdown debacle – these are not distinct, discrete phenomenon, but myriad symptoms of one ruling class’s contempt for everyday working families and the institutions that prioritise their rights and interests over elite privilege.” Earlier, the conference heard from the Conservative MP John Hayes, a pioneer of the party’s culture war-leaning right, who also intimated that true conservatism was being resisted by shadowy liberal forces. He said: “You know, as I do, that the solution is to be found in conservatism. But not in the desiccated, hollowed-out, sugar-free conservatism deemed to be just about acceptable by our liberal masters. Too many conservatives opt out of conflict, instead seeking the approval of the very establishment which wants to grind them into the dust.”</body>

    <head>Pompeii dig finds skeletal remains dating back to Vesuvius earthquake</head>
    <body>The remains of two people believed to have been killed by an earthquake that accompanied the AD79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius have been found in the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. The skeletons, thought to belong to two men in their mid-50s, were found during excavations at the Insula dei Casti Amanti, or Insula of the Chaste Lovers, an area of Pompeii made up of a cluster of homes and a bakery. The well-preserved remains were found beneath a collapsed wall. Bone fractures indicate that the men probably died as a result of multiple injuries sustained as the building they sought refuge in caved in because of an earthquake that struck during the early stage of the volcanic eruption. One of the victims is thought to have raised his arm in an attempt to protect himself from the falling wall. It is believed that the wall collapsed before the arrival of the violent pyroclastic currents that buried the city.

Photograph: Parco Archeologico di Pompei pre/AFP/Getty Images Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii archaeological park, said the discovery brought home even further “the hell” of the human dimension of the tragedy. “As some of the archaeologists said, the discovery is very grounding as they are effectively digging up human beings, which is sad,” he said. “Human mortality is so fragile … in Pompeii, the advancement of excavation techniques helps us to see more clearly the inferno that destroyed the city in two days.” Beads from a necklace and six coins – two dating back to the middle of the second century BC – were also found in the same room as the victims. “Pompeii is an immense archaeological laboratory that in recent years has regained vigour, astonishing the world with the continuous discoveries brought to light and manifesting Italian excellence in this field,” said culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano. The Pompeii ruins were discovered in the 16th century, with the first excavations beginning in 1748. More than 1,500 of the estimated 2,000 victims have been found over the centuries. The last discovery of human remains was in 2020, when the skeletons of two men, believed to be a wealthy man and his slave, were found during excavations at a villa in the outskirts of the city. The two men, lying close together, are believed to have escaped the initial phase of the eruption when the city was blanketed in volcanic ash and pumice, only to then be killed by a blast that happened the following day.</body>

    <head>‘They found hell’: innocent foreigners caught in El Salvador’s mass arrests</head>
    <body>José Antonio Potes and his childhood friend Manuel Castrillón travelled to El Salvador hoping to find the safe, prosperous, tech-friendly paradise that they had heard about in Colombian media. President Nayib Bukele’s draconian crackdown on gangs and ambitious plans to convert the country into a bitcoin-powered regional powerhouse have made him the most popular leader in Latin America – and El Salvador a destination for surfers and tech-bros alike. “We’d heard about this transformation: that there were no more gangs, that things had gotten really safe and that there was an infrastructure boom because of all the investment,” said Castrillón. “We thought we could thrive there.” Potes is a welder and Castrillon an expert in mechanised farming. The two, both 27, come from the tiny town of Riofrío in Valle del Cauca, Colombia. Together they set out to find work and send dollars home to their families. But instead of benefiting from Bukele’s war on gangs, the pair were arrested and locked up in squalid prisons for three months. “They went looking for paradise,” said Ruth Elonaro López, a lawyer at Cristosal, a Salvadoran human rights group. “Instead they found hell.” On 21 January, the day after Potes flew out to join Castrillón, the two men met for lunch in Soyapango, a satellite town just outside the Salvadoran capital. Shortly after they were detained by soldiers and asked for documents. Eight hours later they were taken to a jail, where they were questioned, strip-searched and photographed. They say the officials paid particular attention to their tattoos – a hallmark of the country’s gangs. José Antonio Potes, left, and his childhood friend Manuel Castrillón on their way back to Colombia after three ‘nightmarish’ months. Photograph: Potes “They asked where we got our money from and said it must have been from narco-trafficking in Colombia. But I had $125 in cash and José had $75,” said Castrillón. It was when they were first thrown into a jail cell with 25 others that they began to realise it might be more than a mistake. “We were confused, terrified and couldn’t sleep,” said Potes. “And the nightmare was only just beginning.” Bukele’s firm hand has gained him a cult following at home, and his authoritarianism is admired by the right wing across Latin America. Related: El Salvador crackdown breaks the gangs – at huge cost to human rights While countries across the region are struggling to control criminal violence, the Salvadorian strongman is credited with beating criminal organisations into submission and given glowing profiles in newspapers and magazines. After taking office in 2019, Bukele first tried brokering a pact with gangs, allegedly promising to block extraditions in exchange for law and order, but when the deal broke down he declared a state of emergency in March 2022 – and dropped diplomacy for brute force. Since then, the country has experienced a dramatic drop in violence. El Salvador has frequently ranked as the most murderous country in the world but on 11 May Bukele tweeted that it had not recorded a single homicide in a year. The Salvadorian government says it has jailed nearly 70,000 gang members – about 2% of the country’s population. But human rights groups say thousands of innocent people are being caught up in the offensive. Outside the Ilopango prison where the two Colombians were held, Potes saw dozens of women asking for their children’s whereabouts, all saying they had nothing to do with the gangs. “It started really making sense then that they were just throwing innocent people in jail to show them off to the outside world,” he said. The two men eventually spent a month in Ilopango and almost two more in equally hellish conditions at Jucuapa, where they shared a cell with no toilet – just a bucket – with 400 others. Under the state of emergency, no trial or charges are required to detain someone. Disgruntled neighbours, unhappy partners or rival businessmen can easily take advantage of the breakdown of due process.

The pair say they saw countless other foreigners caught up in the gang crackdown, including Hondurans, Guatemalans and North Americans. Photograph: Potes “You no longer need to have any link with the gangs to be locked up in El Salvador. You simply need to be a young male,” said López. The pair say they saw countless other foreigners caught up in the crackdown, including Hondurans, Guatemalans and North Americans. As Bukele ramps up his attack on the gangs such tales are increasingly common. On 9 May a fisherman from Isla El Espíritu Santo in the south of the country was released after a year in prison after authorities admitted he was wrongly imprisoned following an anonymous phone call. In another case a young lesbian woman was taken from her home by soldiers after she was reportedly denounced by taxi drivers who did not like her sexual orientation. “What these Colombians are living, thousands of are going through,” said López. “The government is trying to project the image that it is restoring order but in reality it is losing control and causing immense, irreversible social damage.” As El Salvador runs out of space to house inmates, prison conditions are growing increasingly dire. Potes and Castrillón say their heads were shaven, their clothes stripped and that guards fired teargas into their cells if they broke silence. Related: ‘It’s a war on the people’: El Salvador’s mass arrests send thousands into despair Potes and Castrillón were eventually freed in April after Potes’s partner, Claudia Marcela García, relentlessly lobbied for the pair’s release in the Colombian press. They had each lost more than 10kg. “We were terrified that if we made this public that it would make things worse but we had to do something. Our four-year-old daughter was asking every day when José would be back and we had no idea if he ever would,” said García. Following their release the rightwing Colombian magazine Semana shared a video of the two men walking along a beach, explaining that the whole thing was a misunderstanding. Castrillón and Potes say they were pressured into making the recording by government officials who promised them houses and jobs. Bukele has since blocked Castrillón on Twitter for making the claims. The Bukele administration did not respond to requests for comment. The two friends say they are trying to set the story straight and raise awareness of two other Colombians, Andrés Felipe Castañeda González and Octavio de Jesús Marín, who they say were also imprisoned without charges. “What’s happening over there is not what it seems,” Potes says. “Yes, they are locking criminals up to make things safer but what good is that when they could come for you in the middle of the night?”</body>

    <head>People in the UK in their 50s and 60s: if you’re working less now, what are you doing instead?</head>
    <body>We’d like to hear from people in the UK in their 50s and 60s who have recently decided to work less or leave the workforce altogether why they have made this decision, and what they are doing instead. The economic inactivity rate for people aged 50 to 64 years has increased slightly, from 27.1% between October and December last year to 27.2% between January and March 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The UK’s overall decrease in economic inactivity between January and March 2023 was largely driven by people aged 16 to 24 years, according to new ONS data. Between October to December 2022 and January to March 2023, there has been a record high net flow out of economic inactivity, while the number of people inactive because of long-term sickness increased to a record high. We’re interested to hear how people in their 50s and 60s in the UK whose economic activity has decreased are spending their time now. Callout</body>

    <head>The secret of Liam Neeson’s success: a monomaniacal fixation on … tea?</head>
    <body>It’s always fascinating to learn how actors choose their roles. In his autobiography, for instance, Bryan Cranston laid out an elaborate calculation where he grades each potential movie on the quality of its story, text, role, director and cast. Meanwhile, less mathematically, Bob Hoskins utilised what he referred to as the “cold bum test”: he read his scripts on the toilet and, if he kept reading one for so long that his bum got cold, that was a sign that he should accept the part. And then we have Liam Neeson. Now that his career has seemingly fully recovered from that weird interview in which he said he once walked the streets looking for a black man to murder, he is promoting his movies in the normal manner again. And, during an interview to promote his new crime thriller Marlowe, Neeson happened to reveal how he picks his movies. Obviously, had this question been asked of him a decade ago his criteria would have probably been: “Is it so completely identical to the first Taken film that nobody will be able to tell the difference?” But Neeson is a little older now, and he has started to make movies that don’t simply rely on his ability to sigh and punch people. Instead, he told Yahoo, he uses a simple trick known as the “cup of tea test”. “If my agent sends me a script, and I get to page five and I think [distractedly] ‘Oh, I must make some tea,’ that’s not a good sign,” Neeson said. On the other hand, if he can read a script from start to finish and only think about making a cup of tea at the end, then that is a good sign. If you want Liam Neeson to be in your film, absolutely under no circumstances should your script mention tea We can discern two key pieces of information here. The first is that Liam Neeson likes to put himself in the place of the audience when reading a script. If the movie cannot hold his attention, there is no chance that it will keep the attention of the average punter on the street. This is solid, popular, gut-instinct decision-making from a man with far more experience than most. The other key piece of information is this: Jesus Christ, Liam Neeson is obsessed with tea. Like, he is fully obsessed. Tea haunts Liam Neeson’s every waking moment. The man is so monomaniacal about cups of tea that you sense he only reads scripts in the first place in a doomed bid to temporarily banish all thought of them from his mind. By Liam Neeson’s standards, then even after finishing a good script – even after finishing the greatest script ever written – his first thought won’t be a critical assessment of the workload it requires of him, but gratuitous relief that he finally gets to devote more of his time to thinking about tea again. Listen, maybe I’m wrong here. Maybe, as someone who can often go several hours at a time without thinking a single thought about tea, I’m the weirdo. Maybe I’m in the minority, and everyone else is so fixated on tea that they can’t even read five pages of a screenplay without peeling away, lost in a deep and wonderful reverie about all the different cups of tea they’d like to drink. If that’s the case, I apologise. But I don’t think that is the case. I don’t think anyone on Earth loves tea as much as Liam Neeson loves tea. Liam Neeson’s enjoyment of tea seems to go beyond the normal human tea parameters. He seems like he’s addicted. It’s worrying. Still, if the cup of tea test works for Liam Neeson, then it works. He has built a fine filmography over the years on this criterion. What’s more, this also acts as a handy lesson for budding feature writers. If you want Liam Neeson to be in your film, absolutely under no circumstances should your script mention tea. As soon as it does, Liam Neeson will drop the script to the floor and walk to the kitchen in a fugue state to fill a bath of tea and sit in it, and your masterpiece will be lost to the world for ever.</body>

    <head>Turkey’s economic crisis expected to deepen after Erdoğan tops poll</head>
    <body>Analysts expect Turkey’s economic crisis to worsen after President Tayyip Erdoğan came top in the first round of the country’s presidential election and his party gained a parliamentary majority in a legislative vote. The Turkish lira, which has devalued steadily in recent years including halving in value in one year alone, dropped close to a historic low as markets opened the morning after Sunday’s vote. President Erdoğan subverted expectations by coming out on top, gaining 49.5% of the vote in the presidential race compared with 44.9% for his challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. As neither candidate reached the 50% threshold needed to win outright, a runoff vote will take place on 28 May. Erdoğan’s governing alliance, made up of his Justice and Development party as well as a group of nationalist parties, also surged to secure a parliamentary majority. Widespread concern about a cost of living crisis did not drive away support for Erdoğan at the polls, even though his unorthodox economic policies, including a long-term aversion to raising interest rates, have contributed to rising inflation and the increasing cost of food and other basic goods. “Hopes of an opposition victory and a return to orthodox policymaking have evaporated,” wrote Liam Peach, of Capital Economics. “Instead, there is now a very real risk that an Erdoğan victory could lead to macroeconomic instability in Turkey, including the threat of a severe currency crisis and strains in the banking and sovereign debt positions further down the line.” Turkey is the world’s 19th largest economy, according to the World Bank. It has noted that the Turkish economic crisis of the past five years has been accompanied by efforts to support economic growth “with credit booms and demand stimulus”. Economists from Bloomberg estimate the Turkish central bank has spent more than $177bn supporting the lira since December 2021. The Turkish Inflation Research Group (ENAG), which measures inflation on a basket of goods and services, recorded a 105.19% price increase last month on the previous year, adding that prices were up by almost a third compared with the beginning of 2023. The price of onions, a staple in Turkish cuisine, quickly became a talking point in the election after Kılıçdaroğlu released a video last month stating: “Now, one kilogram of onions is 30 liras, if [Erdoğan] stays it will be 100 liras.” Erdoğan hit back at an election rally, dismissing concerns about the rising price of food. “Our cause is great. We know how to smash an onion with our fist and how to eat it. In this country, there is no [expensive] onion, potato or cucumber problem. We have already fixed problems in Turkey,” he said. Related: The Guardian view on Turkey’s election results: a step towards autocracy? | Editorial The US credit rating agency Fitch Ratings pointed to Turkey’s dwindling foreign reserves caused by attempts to stabilise the lira, forecasting difficulties for the next government. “Regardless of who wins, the next government will still face a challenging economic backdrop characterised by pent-up foreign exchange demand and pressure on the lira, a wide current account deficit, declining international reserves and high inflation,” it said. The prospect that members of Turkey’s six-party opposition coalition could secure victory in order to restore international confidence in the Turkish economy and return to more orthodox economic policies appeared increasingly unlikely. Speaking before the first round of voting, the economist Bilge Yılmaz, of the nationalist IYI party, said Turkey’s economic crisis potentially outstripped anything the country had endured in decades. “Turkey right now is deprived of foreign capital because it’s not predictable, it’s not trustworthy … there are effectively zero dollars left, for all practical purposes zero,” he said.</body>

    <head>France to compensate thousands more relatives of Algerian Harki fighters</head>
    <body>The French government is to pay reparations to thousands more Algerians and their families held in internment camps in France after the north African country’s war of independence. Acting on a report by an independent commission, the government agreed to increase the number of Harkis and their relatives eligible to claim compensation for being forced to live in deplorable and squalid living conditions several decades ago. Up to 200,000 Algerians were recruited to fight alongside French colonial forces or as “auxiliaries” in the war for independence between 1954 and 1962. The word Harki comes from the Arabic for “movement” and referred to the mobile units in which many of the Algerians served. Paris had promised to look after them at the end of the conflict but then left them to fend for themselves after independence was signed on 18 March 1962. Many of those trapped in Algeria and branded traitors were massacred in revenge for supporting the country’s former colonial masters. An estimated 42,000 Harkis and around the same number of relatives who fled to France were held in camps that led to the deaths of dozens of children between 1962 and 1975. The French government initially refused to recognise their right to stay, forcing them to remain in squalid camps. France held its firs national day to honour the Harkis in 2001 but it was not until 2016 that the Socialist president, François Hollande, formally recognised the state’s role in abandoning them. “I recognise the responsibility of French governments in abandoning the Harkis, the massacres of those who remained in Algeria and the inhumane conditions of those transferred to camps in France,” Hollande said at the time. In 2021, Emmanuel Macron asked for “forgiveness” on behalf of France for leaving the Harkis and their families to their fate after independence. In February 2022, the French government recognised the country’s responsibility for “the indignity of the hosting and living conditions on its territory” and the “exclusion, suffering and lasting trauma” that ensued. It passed a law giving reparations to those who had lived in 89 internment camps of up to €3,000 (£2,600) for those held for a year and an extra €1,000 for every subsequent year. At the time, about 50,000 Harkis were expected to be eligible for reparations at a total cost of €310m. However, a report by the national independent commission for the recognition and reparation of prejudices suffered by the Harkis (CNIH) identified 45 new sites, including “military camps, slums, transit shacks”, where up to 14,000 Harkis and their families were forced to live. The decision to enlarge the possibility for Harkis and their relatives to claim compensation came after the CNIH report was submitted to the French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, on Monday evening. Patricia Mirallès, the secretary of state for veterans’ affairs and memory, said the decision would go some way to “make amends for a new injustice, including in regions where until now the suffering of the Harkis living there were not recognised”. The behaviour of France during and after the war for Algerian independence is just one of the legacies of the country’s colonial legacy that remains unresolved. These include nuclear testing in the Pacific area of French Polynesia and its role in the Rwandan genocide.</body>

    <head>UK’s most literal rock documentary, A Year in a Field, up for film prize</head>
    <body>It is a rock documentary but there is no pounding music, no terrible behaviour, no bombastic characters. Instead, the 86-minute film tells the slow but compelling story of 12 months in the life of a 4,000-year-old stone that stands sentinel in the Cornish landscape. A Year in a Field is a surprise inclusion in the prestigious Sheffield DocFest, where it is up for a prize, and will be in UK cinemas at the time of the autumn equinox this year. While the film is simple, its maker, Christopher Morris, also hopes it will raise questions about the climate emergency and the impact our brief existence is having on the planet. “The overarching theme that emerged is my own inability to grapple with the climate crisis,” said Morris. “What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to react to things that are happening in Brazil – a place I’ve never been to – or the Arctic? “I’ve never strapped myself to a tree, never even been on a protest march. That’s not in my nature, that’s not me. But standing quietly in a field, a sort of one-man direct action seemed kind of appealing to me.” No human makes an appearance in the film – the stone is the centrepoint. Photograph: Christopher Morris/Bosena2022 The film, appropriately, emerged slowly. Morris had spent six years taking photos of the stone, which he published on an Instagram account, as a creative side project while he worked in management at Falmouth University’s school of film and television. “At the start of lockdown I decided to begin filming the stone instead. I was struggling to get to grips with environmental problems but I didn’t have a plan or a budget, it was just me.” Between the winter solstices of 2020 and 2021, Morris walked for a mile from his home in west Cornwall to the stone each day and filmed what he found. “It was usually on the walks there and back that themes started to emerge.” He filmed at sunrise, sunset, in storms. A crop of barley grows around the stone; a rainbow frames it. Though the stone is isolated, the outside world crept in. The wrapping from an Ann Summers piece of clothing blew into the field, prompting Morris to think about environmentally unfriendly materials used in some underwear. The G7 summit – and a US warship – arrived at nearby St Ives and Carbis Bay. “It made me think, perhaps they should carry out an environmental audit before they go to war,” he said. The film is the second feature from the Cornish production company Bosena. Photograph: Christopher Morris/Bosena 2022 Morris said his film was the “antithesis” of the “million-dollar dazzle” to be found in high-end nature documentaries. “They almost appear like science fiction,” he said. His film dwells for three minutes on an insect on a leaf with no commentary. “Then at the end I say I have no idea what this insect is called.” He films slugs and snails. “I’m good at filming things that move slowly. There are some great slug shots.” The song of skylarks can be heard. “But they eluded me. I couldn’t find them in the lens.” Having a “rubbish” tripod also helped, in a way. “I couldn’t pan or tilt. It made it all very simple.” The film is the second feature from the Cornish production company Bosena, after Mark Jenkin’s Enys Men, a folk horror that did well in art house cinemas this winter – and also features a standing stone. Morris said he was “gobsmacked” when the film was picked up by Sheffield and a distributor. “It’s such as personal film, shot and edited on my own and made for no money. It’s the inner life of a field, it’s very slow, it’s very quiet and gentle.” No human makes an appearance – the stone is the centrepoint. “I don’t believe in electric powers coming out of stones or anything like that,” said Morris. “But I do believe they were placed here for a purpose. They are very powerful. We should probably try to reimagine that purpose, to use them in a way that makes sense for us to use now.”</body>

    <head>‘I can’t afford groceries’: why one-third of US college students don’t have enough to eat</head>
    <body>For Anthony Meng, a senior at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota, food insecurity can take on many different forms. On some days, it means skipping meals as he’s rushing to work or to class. On others, “it’s like, I don’t think I can afford groceries,” he said. “Which is difficult to say at times, but it’s the reality of the situation.” Meng, 22, rolls out of bed every morning around 9 or 10am. His schedule is typically packed with back-to-back lectures and extracurriculars. More often than not, Meng finds himself heading out for the day with just a granola bar in hand, if anything at all. Fortunately there’s a place on campus where he can seek refuge: the Food Resource Center, a beloved hangout where students and staff can stock up on free fresh produce and groceries. Funded by donations, grants and student fees, the center also offers prepared meals, microwaves to heat them up in, and couches and a TV for people to gather, eat and pass the time. “It’s an area of campus where I can not only find solace,” Meng said. “The fact that I can go get a hot meal […] it means the whole world.” Shelves are stocked with food and supplies inside the Food Resource Center at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Recent estimates put the number of campus pantries at about 800, most of them established in the past decade. According to a 2020 survey of more than 195,000 students across the country, conducted by the Hope Center at Temple University, nearly 30% of students at four-year colleges reported experiencing food insecurity. For those at two-year colleges, the number was even higher – almost 40%. And with changes to student eligibility requirements for federally funded hunger relief programs set to take place in May, advocates say the situation could get even worse. *** Most Hamline students, including Meng, plan their visits to the Food Resource Center around its delivery days – Wednesdays and Fridays. After the food donation trucks pull away, the center’s aisles start to brim with a medley of staples and unexpected treats, from perfectly fine produce to an array of unsold Trader Joe’s snacks. For the past two years, Meng has received no financial assistance from his family to cover tuition or rent, so he works at H&amp;M on weekends to pay for school and basic needs. The ability to get food on campus at no cost, with no questions asked, means that it’s just a little bit easier to focus on simply being a student.

He will also grab a prepared meal to eat later, after the long dance rehearsals that take up the rest of the afternoon. For students who can’t make it to the center in person, there’s a grocery delivery service. During Ramadan, the center extended its hours to 9pm so observant Muslim students could grab something to eat after breaking their fasts. Despite high rates of hunger, students face an uphill battle when trying to access the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), the federally funded hunger relief program that gives people monthly allowances for groceries. Since the 1980s, people who attend school on a more than part-time basis have been largely excluded from Snap, out of concern that students from well-to-do backgrounds would draw public resources instead of assistance from their families. So instead of qualifying for Snap based on asset and income requirements – as the majority of Americans do – college students also need to work at least 20 hours a week, a requirement that anti-hunger advocates say is onerous and unreasonable for someone who is attending classes and doing school work every day. Advocates argue that strict eligibility rules for full-time students are based on antiquated ideas of who attends higher education. In the decades since these restrictions were put in place, the proportion of post-secondary students from low-income backgrounds has increased steadily. According to a 2019 Pew Research study, the number of undergraduate students from families in poverty was about 20% , representing a more than 50% jump in the prior two decades. Yet despite the evolving profile of “typical” college students, lawmakers have done little to update Snap eligibility rules to reflect their current economic realities.

Daniels, who is pursuing a master’s degree in social work and works full time, is anticipating losing additional pandemic-era Snap benefits. Photograph: Rachel Jessen/The Guardian Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the federal government temporarily lifted the 20-hour work requirement for students. But after the public health emergency declaration expired in May, Snap rules will soon revert to pre-pandemic standards. According to one study, pandemic Snap exemptions for students made an additional 3 million people eligible to enroll in the program than would not have otherwise. Now, many of them will find themselves without grocery money that they’ve grown to depend on for three years. “Oftentimes, the general public thinks of college students as that 18- or 19-year-old who’s continuing their education from high school,” said Jaime Hansen, executive director of Swipe Out Hunger, which advocates for policies to alleviate food insecurity among college students. “That’s no longer the majority.” Still, the archetype of the typical college student who can draw from family resources and devote all their time to school persists. Kyler Daniels, a 27-year-old mother and student knows this intimately. Daniels lives in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, with her daughter and boyfriend. While pursuing a master’s degree in social work part-time and remotely, she also works a full-time job at a local non-profit that supports children. As a parent, food security is always at the top of her mind. Her family relies on food stamps, but when we spoke in March, she was bracing for them to get cut after the recent elimination of extra pandemic benefits. She supplements grocery store hauls with food boxes from a local church, or occasional free food at work. She tries to feed her daughter fresh fruits and vegetables when possible, while also trying not to overspend.

Photograph: Rachel Jessen/The Guardian Daniels says she regularly faces a lack of empathy from professors and administrators about the challenges of balancing education with parenthood and a career. Situations like hers are often perceived as unusual or abnormal, she said, and she often encounters resistance when asking for accommodations that help her balance being a mom and a worker, as well. “Moms, families, just individuals who have other things outside of going to school – I just wish people will be more considerate of that,” she said. *** In the past decades, researchers have uncovered countless ways that hunger is detrimental to academic performance: it can impair student focus; it can lead to poor mental health, and serve as a strong predictor of depression and anxiety; and it can even get in the way of students graduating and getting their degrees at all. Meng at Hamline isn’t enrolled in Snap, but knows many peers who are already bracing for the end of their benefits. At some campus food pantries, there have been worrisome hints in recent months that food insecurity is already on the rise. Alex Silver, 21, is the student director of the food pantry at the University of Washington. In the fall quarter of 2022, the pantry saw over 3,600 visits – more than double the demand during the same window back in 2019. Part of this can be attributed to increased outreach and marketing. Nonetheless, Silver notes the pantry itself is struggling to keep up with the rapid increase in demand. In February, the pantry saw more than 400 visits in a single week, a threshold it hadn’t hit before. Squeezed by high needs and high costs, the pantry has had to laser in on how it spends funding, which all comes from donations. The pantry’s canned foods used to include Spam, beets and carrots. Now that’s been replaced by rows and rows of canned corn. Previously, it was able to offer basic hygiene items, like toilet paper, shampoo and tampons in addition to groceries – those are all gone, too. To ensure that shelves don’t go empty as soon as the pantry opens, food has to be rationed out on a points-based system that considers each item’s caloric value and nutritional profile. Kyler Daniels, 27, opens a ukulele her mother bought for Daniels’ daughter, Nova, at their home. Photograph: Rachel Jessen/The Guardian “[People] are not just coming for themselves, but maybe their entire household,” Silver said. “It’s very hard for us to have enough food for everyone, certainly not enough for everyone to get as much as they need. Silver pointed out that high demand is emblematic of a much broader problem, one that charitable organizations alone can’t resolve. “For us, the main struggle is that a lot of people hope or expect the food pantry to be the solution for food insecurity on our campus. And we’re just not at a point and probably will never be a point where that could be our function. But we can help dampen the effect of it in every single possible way that we can.” Other food pantries on campuses around the country are feeling similar constraints, caught between rising demand and falling food donations. Looking toward to the summer and fall, advocates and students alike are concerned that food insecurity could soar as supports like Snap become harder to access once again. “We are frankly really concerned,” Hansen said. “A lot of the pandemic resources that were supporting students in their higher education goals are falling by the wayside […] So we’re very worried about what the next couple of months is going to look like for our student population.”</body>

    <head>Progressive organization Justice Democrats adopts four-day work week</head>
    <body>The progressive organization Justice Democrats has adopted a four-day working week, a policy that has received praise from prominent leftwing leaders like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Justice Democrats, which has helped elect progressive lawmakers like Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, shifted to a four-day working week for its 20 employees starting last August on a six-month trial basis. In March, the group decided to extend the policy indefinitely after its employees reported the change allowed them to better manage the grueling nature of campaign work. Related: US workers deserve a break. It’s time for a 32-hour working week | Bernie Sanders “A big reason why we ultimately decided to do a four-day week indefinitely is because of how much we trust everyone in the organization to prioritize what they need to prioritize,” said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats. “That extra space has, at least for us, improved productivity and people’s attitudes as they show up to work.” The shift comes as progressive leaders have embraced the idea of a shorter week, arguing that the 40-hour week established by the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 no longer reflects the reality of Americans’ working lives. In March, congressman Mark Takano of California reintroduced his bill to set the standard working week at 32 hours, and Sanders has now joined the cause. “It’s time to reduce the work week to 32 hours with no loss in pay,” Sanders wrote in a Guardian op-ed earlier this month. “It’s time to reduce the stress level in our country and allow Americans to enjoy a better quality of life. It’s time to make sure that working people benefit from rapidly increasing technology, not just large corporations that are already doing phenomenally well.” Although few American companies have adopted a four-day working week, the idea is not novel. France has mandated a 35-hour work week since 2000, and some French politicians have called for lowering that threshold to 32 hours. Iceland has also seen success in its trials of a four-day, 35-hour working week. In comparison, Americans work an average of 43.1 hours per week, according to a 2022 Gallup survey. Critics fear that the shift to a 32-hour week could increase employers’ labor costs and further decrease employee productivity at a time when American workers’ output has slumped. Data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows US productivity declined for three straight quarters last year, although labor output has still increased by nearly 500% overall since 1947. But Justice Democrats employees said the switch to a 32-hour, Monday to Thursday schedule had made them more efficient and focused with their tasks. “I’m highly productive during my work hours, and honestly I procrastinate less,” said Becca Rast, a managing director at Justice Democrats. “It allows me to have a tighter, more focused work schedule, which I really thrive under.” Trial studies of companies with 32-hour working weeks have shown similar results. One pilot program launched in the United Kingdom last year found that employees who worked fewer hours per week reported higher levels of job satisfaction while 23 participating companies witnessed an average revenue increase of 1.4%. When the program concluded, 56 out of 61 organizations said they would keep the policy in place at least temporarily. The reduced stress levels among those with shorter working weeks can also help reduce employee burnout and turnover, ultimately making companies more productive in the long run. The UK pilot program found that 39% of employees with reduced working hours reported feeling less stressed, and 71% said they had reduced levels of burnout by the end of the trial. “It’s really good for our health – our mental health and our physical health,” Rast said. “When I’m overworked and overrun with thinking about work, I am not able to actually show up for my team and make the kinds of change that we’re talking about. And so it’s been really healthy for me to be able to get there, and I see that for our whole team as well.” For Becca Rose, a senior strategist at Justice Democrats, the four-day week has given her the time and flexibility to address some chronic health conditions without feeling stretched thin by her other responsibilities at work and at home. “I need these extra eight hours in a week to be able to feel like I can both do my job and also manage some personal things that came up,” Rose said. “Those trials come up in life, whether it’s chronic health [issues] or something completely different. Those things come up for everyone. So what seems like a luxury quickly becomes something that feels very essential.” Related: Bernie Sanders unveils plan for $17-an-hour US minimum wage The switch has felt particularly necessary because of the grueling nature of campaign work, Justice Democrats staffers said. Particularly in the immediate run-up to an election, campaigns and their partner organizations are often expected to put in long hours with few days off to get their candidates across the finish line. “Especially for progressive challengers, because we have to launch so far out to be able to put up a competitive campaign [and] to build the infrastructure, a whole year of just ‘go, go, go’ is not sustainable,” said Supreet Kaur, candidate coordination manager for Justice Democrats. Justice Democrats first started its four-day week policy last year at the close of the primary season, which is generally the organization’s busiest time in the election cycle as they go toe to toe with more centrist Democratic candidates. Rojas acknowledged that it may be “challenging” to adjust the four-day working week to the demands of the primary season, but she still expressed a commitment to the policy, encouraging other progressive organizations to consider making the change as well. “It’s better work. It’s healthier workers,” Rojas said. “And when we think about our movement, everybody shows up better.”</body>

    <head>The centre left is on the up around the world. Here’s what Keir Starmer can learn from it</head>
    <body>Those of us who desperately want to see the back of this dismal Conservative government should take heart from the recent local elections in England. We should also be encouraged by the successes of the centre left around the world, which has defeated the political right in elections in Australia, Germany, Spain, Portugal and the US, after a dramatic decline in support for social democratic parties after the 2008 financial crisis. But if we can learn one thing from these recent successes, it is that there is nothing inevitable about the return of social democracy. Granted, after the pandemic, many voters have grown weary of the failure of the political right to address their need for security and prosperity as they face the cost of living crisis. But voters everywhere remain sceptical of the ability of politics and politicians, from all parties, to act in their interests. They are sceptical too of the capacity for government to change their lives for the better, at a time when we badly need to renew the modern state in the face of the perma-crises hitting all our nations. The metaphor that the pendulum inevitably swings back from right to left and back again ignores the simple fact that of the 123 years of the Labour party’s existence, it has only been in power for just over 30 of them. If there is a pendulum, it gets stubbornly stuck on one side. The UK Labour party needs to take learning, not comfort, from the tentative revival of the centre left. Undoubtedly, Scott Morrison in Australia and Donald Trump in the US were divisive and unpopular incumbents. The Australian Labor party learned from its defeat by Morrison in 2019 not to overload the prospectus for government, and came back with clear, bold pledges in 2022. Anthony Albanese was the voice of hopeful, safe change for Australia, carrying a positive message in the run-up to the campaign, with practical, deliverable promises on the people’s priorities. Similarly the Social Democratic party in Germany made four big simple pledges to back its grander missions for government. These successful sister parties have modelled a steady and unifying leadership in contrast to the divisive politics of their opponents, backed by solid social democratic platforms on wages, pensions and public services that resonate with people’s need for security and prosperity after the pandemic. ‘Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese (centre) has just announced a slew of reforms to tackle some of the structural problems such as older care and childcare.’ Photograph: Matt Turner/AAP In the UK, there is no route to a parliamentary majority for Labour without reconstituting the historical coalition between today’s working-class voters and liberal-leaning middle-class voters. Of course, their forms have changed over time and election results with different voting systems are reflecting that societal fragmentation. Today’s working class is multi-ethnic, more likely to be female, and living and working in towns and cities across the country – and there is simply no way to get a parliamentary majority without them. For Labour that means realigning with new working-class voters. And the local election results back polling that shows Labour is ahead again among working-class voters. Whether this tentative revival can be turned into durable majorities will rest on whether we can deliver the change that people are crying out for. If voters give the centre left the chance to be in government again, then the changes Labour instigates must make a difference to people’s lives, not just win plaudits in the abstract. This is “kitchen table economics”, to coin a phrase from the Australians. Despite the highfalutin speak of policy experts, it is much, much harder these days to translate policy change into real-world improvements in people’s pockets. The old playbook from left or right of a pay out or a tax cut won’t work in an era when these can be cancelled out by the next gas bill. Related: Are you hoping for a progressive alliance to oust the Tories? Don’t hold your breath | Martin Kettle Keir Starmer’s embrace of a mission-driven approach to government provides the opportunity to tackle the root causes of stagnating wages and volatile costs, as well as offer help now. On the back of strong jobs growth, Albanese’s government has just announced a slew of reforms to provide assistance with the cost of living, tackle some of the structural problems such as older care and childcare, and bring the budget back into surplus. Being streamlined and disciplined during a campaign does not have to inhibit serious-minded reform in government. Around the world, rightwing populists remain a serious electoral presence. The forces that brought them to the fore have accelerated rather than slowed. They are winning larger shares of the vote, as shown in the recent elections in Italy and Sweden. Marine Le Pen is outpolling Emmanuel Macron in France. Donald Trump is outpolling Joe Biden ahead of the presidential elections next year. This week, London is hosting a three-day jamboree of right-leaning self-styled NatCons. Make no mistake, there is a battle on, and it is a battle for the future of our nations that will be fought in the media and conversations in our towns, suburbs and neighbourhoods. In three years, Starmer has taken the Labour party further and faster than many thought imaginable. After the encouraging result at the local elections, Labour now offers the hope that a better future for our country is possible. But that must be grounded in a practical programme to improve people’s prospects. Only then will we have earned the trust we ask for.

    <head>Anger as intruder tries to take photos in 2:22 West End dressing room</head>
    <body>The new star of the West End play 2:22: A Ghost Story has condemned an attempt to take illicit photographs of actors in their dressing room. The thriller, which has been staged at several London theatres over the last two years, had its first preview at the Apollo on Sunday night with a new cast led by American actor Sophia Bush (from the TV series One Tree Hill). On social media, Bush said that during the afternoon of that performance: “A man stuck a camera in the window of our ladies’ dressing room.” Later, the same individual “shoved his camera through our curtains” before a member of the production was able to intervene and the intruder fled. Bush said that the incident “colours a beautiful night with something ugly and scary and sad”. She continued: “Thanks to everyone who showed up with love. To the predatory guy? Fuck you very much. I hope someone there for our opening might be able to help us figure out who you are … you deserve to be caught.” A statement from the show’s producers expressed anger that “a member of the public tried to take photos of cast members in a private space” before the 6pm performance. The new cast for Danny Robins’s popular play includes Ricky Champ, Clifford Samuel and Jaime Winstone. Its previous casts have included Lily Allen and Cheryl. Luke Thompson and James Norton in A Little Life. Nude photos of Norton were taken by a paparazzo at one performance. Photograph: Jan Versweyveld The production company Runaway Entertainment is now working with the Apollo to put increased security measures in place. “It is sad that the actions of one unscrupulous person may have an impact on how our cast feels able to engage with audiences at the theatre,” it said, adding that it welcomes “everyone who comes to see the show as respectful, enthusiastic audience members”. A representative for the production said there was “no real evidence” that the photographer was from the paparazzi. Related: ‘We’ve had to stop people fighting and urinating in their seats’: the ugly new side of theatre audiences The inappropriate use of mobile phones in theatres was one of the many examples of antisocial behaviour given in a recent survey of more than 1,500 people working in UK theatrical venues. Ninety per cent of respondents to the survey by the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre union (Bectu) reported that they had directly experienced or witnessed poor audience behaviour. Nearly half said they had thought about leaving the industry as a result. Bectu has called for venues across the UK to sign up to a new charter to help protect workers. In March, naked photos were taken of the actor James Norton on stage in A Little Life and published on MailOnline, prompting widespread outrage. That production, currently in the West End, is one of several to provide theatregoers with stickers to cover their cameraphones. Dr Kirsty Sedgman, a scholar specialising in audience research, recently told the Guardian that such incidents could lead to audiences being asked to lock up their phones during performances.</body>

    <head>TechScape: Can Jack Dorsey’s Bluesky really take over from Twitter?</head>
    <body>Let’s check in on social media. In February, Bluesky released its iOS app. The social network began as a spinoff within Twitter to build a fully “decentralised” protocol, something that could replicate the Twitter experience without placing the company itself at the centre of impossible decisions around content moderation. Its history is intimately tied up with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s pivot towards bitcoin and decentralisation, and Dorsey still sits on Bluesky’s board of directors, but the company is now independent of Twitter, and over the past three months its userbase has been growing rapidly. There’s a lot to be said about the technology of Bluesky, but its importance to the success of the social network is minor compared to a single decision made back in February: handing control of the waitlist to the users. Because the service is still in beta, you you have to be invited to use it. Existing users get roughly one invite code every two weeks, though a slightly murky system seems to hand more codes to some than others. Download the app, enter the code, pick a username and you’re live on Bluesky, staring at a feed that is … basically the same as Twitter’s. The invitation requirement ensures several things, in roughly ascending order of importance: firstly, that the service grows at a steady rate, rather than exploding with interest and then collapsing under the weight of user numbers; secondly, that no one arrives on Bluesky without knowing at least one other user, avoiding the horrors of an empty feed; thirdly, because it means that the network is filled with users who have hurdled the low bar of at least one person wanting to speak to them; and lastly, because it means loads of people want to join Bluesky but can’t, and are instead filling up every other social media feed with requests for invite codes. Artificial scarcity is a powerful marketing tool, and access to Bluesky is as scarce as can be right now. As of last week, the app reportedly had more than 70,000 users. That’s a lot more than zero, but a fraction of Twitter’s 360 million. And yet among those 70,000 users are US congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, actor Kumail Nanjiani, and, cuttingly, the recording artist Grimes, who is Elon Musk’s ex-girlfriend and the mother of two of his children. But it’s a dangerous wave to ride. Withhold too many invites, and the thrill of the new network risks wearing off before most users even get the chance to try it out. That, in part, feels like the cleanest description of what happened to Clubhouse, the buzzy live-audio app that exploded, and then imploded, all within the span of one of the UK’s interminable lockdowns. Give out invites too freely, though, and you lose the benefit of scarcity while still making it awkward for new users to actually sign up. Even the sweet spot has its own problems: users on Bluesky are fans of its unique culture, the outcome of numerous technical flaws combining with a fanbase made up of a concentrated clique of brainwormed posters. But that culture can’t last. Even if the app’s developers were to impose new restrictions on who can get invitations to protect the network’s culture, a social network with seven million users is inherently going to be different to one with 70,000, and there’s no meaningful way for Bluesky to stay small and thrive.

It’s a hip app with strong network effects among cool former Twitter users. But the service itself has bolder ambitions: it was, as I said, built to be a decentralised replacement for Twitter, and those goals still exist. The app is built on top of software, at AT Protocol, which is designed to allow for anyone to run their own server, compatible with Bluesky. At the moment, that’s mostly theoretical: there’s one AT Protocol user client, the Bluesky app, and one AT protocol server, the Bluesky server. But the goal is to open it up, and achieve the initial goal of decentralisation. I trust the Bluesky team to get that far. But I have my doubts that the service will thrive with the decentralisation being anything more than a theoretical option for hardcore users, or a poison pill to prevent a repeat of the Elon Musk takeover. Why? Because of the elephant in the room: Mastodon. The AT protocol isn’t the first try at building a decentralised replacement for Twitter. Mastodon, which is built on top of ActivityPub, came first. And the service has had substantial success, with more than 10m registered accounts across the “fediverse”, the loose collections of servers and services that makes up the network. But Mastodon has alienated many, in large part because of that very decentralisation. Until earlier this month, the first choice presented to users of the official app was to pick a server – a choice that has little immediate consequence, with few reasons for a novice to care, but one that feels weighty and momentous. Days after Bluesky went viral, an update was pushed to default users into the largest server, mastodon.social, but not before service had established the reputation of being hard to use. Bluesky won’t have missed that, and so it seems poised to remain decentralised in name only, focusing on usability over complete freedom. The two services have now set themselves up as rival camps. Each is drawing increasingly crude stereotypes of users of the other service – Mastodon is for people who run Linux on the desktop and scold people for not strictly hewing to unwritten ethics, while Bluesky is for techbros and clout chasers who don’t have any principles other than being where the cool kids are and will return to Twitter when the buzz dies down. But in the end, they’re on the same side: whichever one Elon Musk isn’t. Oh, and Twitter’s still on fire Meanwhile Musk announced a new chief executive for Twitter, handling business operations while he focuses on tech and product directions. This means, in rough terms, that Elon Musk will be operating as chief technology operator, a position that normally reports to the chief executive, who in turn reports to the executive chair, a role currently held by … Elon Musk. Who would take such a job? Linda Yaccarino, the head of global advertising at NBCUniversal until the day her new position was announced. From our report: Musk added on Friday that he looked forward to working with Yaccarino on transforming Twitter into X, the “everything app” along the lines of China’s multi-faceted WeChat. Musk did not name Yaccarino in the initial post, but on Friday, NBCUniversal, the entertainment conglomerate behind the NBC TV network and the Universal film studio, announced that Yaccarino had left the business without revealing her onward destination. Musk’s confirmation came soon afterwards. Unsurprisingly for someone taking this job, Yaccarino appears to be a Musk fan: She interviewed Musk on stage at an advertising conference in Miami last month, in which she told the Tesla CEO that some advertisers “have a challenge with your points of view”, to which Musk replied that some of his tweets should be taken with a “grain of salt”. Yaccarino also said in the interview: “If freedom of speech, as he says, is the bedrock of this country, I’m not sure there’s anyone in this room who could disagree with that.” In April, Yaccarino tweeted a clip from an interview between Musk and the comedian Bill Maher on the HBO show Real Time With Bill Maher, in which she tagged Musk with an “on fire” emoji. In the clip, Musk is asked by Maher about the “woke mind virus”, prompting Musk to state that the world needed to be “cautious” about anything that is “anti-meritocratic” and “results in the suppression of free speech”. It’s for the best that she supports her new boss and underling, because within hours of the news breaking that she was about to run Twitter, she became the site’s main character. Yaccarino is also the chair of the World Economic Forum’s Future of Work taskforce, and a member of the WEF’s media, entertainment and culture industry governors steering committee. Detailing the overlap between the WEF and various conspiracy theories is too much for the third item in this week’s newsletter, but suffice to say that if you have a blue check on Twitter and a strong fear that 15-minute cities are cover for a woke mind virus that will force us all to live in pods and eat bugs, then someone from WEF running a social network is probably your worst nightmare.

    <head>Farrell and Ford’s final face-off could shape England’s World Cup destiny</head>
    <body>The first rule of finals rugby is the same as it ever was. The team that maintain their composure when the pressure starts to mount are generally the side that prevail. And if your playmakers can display a sure touch in the final quarter, your odds shorten even more. There were some good examples last weekend, not least from Munster’s Jack Crowley. When the moment came to nail Leinster with a late drop-goal in the Aviva Stadium, the 23-year-old was more than equal to the challenge to book his team a place in the United Rugby Championship final against the Stormers in Cape Town. It underlined why several good judges believe he has a lengthy Test career ahead of him. Related: Sale dreaming of Premiership glory and northern rugby union revival | Gerard Meagher In the cases of Owen Farrell and George Ford, however, a more urgent debate is resurfacing. Farrell and Ford are international-class fly-halves; they have 190 England caps between them and were instrumental in steering, respectively, Saracens and Sale to this season’s Premiership final. Their eagerly awaited Twickenham duel on Saturday week is now freighted with extra significance. Which of them will end up being lobbed the keys to No 10 when England kick off their Rugby World Cup campaign against Argentina in September? It is a familiar question with a fascinating fresh twist. Because Ford, 30, and Farrell, 31, have come through periods of turbulence to become properly rounded, mature match-winners. In Ford’s case, injury and the emergence of Marcus Smith threatened to marginalise him at Test level. Farrell had the England captaincy taken from him last year and lost his goal-kicking mojo. Now, with a World Cup less than four months away, both look as composed and influential on the field as they have ever done. Their club coaches waxed lyrical about them at the weekend with good reason. Farrell’s – and Saracens’ – option-taking was outstanding against Northampton and his full range of kicking skills was in glorious evidence. Better even than the skilful little grubber kick that set up Sean Maitland for a momentum-building early try was the soaring “spiral bomb” in the second half that left poor George Furbank grasping at fresh air. While it ended up bouncing the wrong side of the corner flag, no kick out of hand this season has been struck so sweetly. Farrell just stood there and smiled, like a golfer who has just driven the distant green only to see his ball ricochet off the flagstick and into the lake. Ford’s contribution, though, was even more telling. As Leicester’s young half-backs tightened up in the last quarter and started making costly errors, the former Tiger was tactically spot-on. He lacks Farrell’s physical presence but few see the game more clearly. While Sale’s winning try, scored by Aaron Reed, came from Ford’s worst pass of the day, a bouncing ball that the winger did brilliantly to collect, he barely put a foot wrong otherwise. George Ford in action for Sale against Leicester. His vision and clarity could be just what England need in France. Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/Shutterstock As readers of this column will already be aware, Smith is also a player of rare, energising talent. Watching Ford in recent weeks, though, it is impossible not to wonder about the potential shorter-term implications for the national side. In the end it is less a matter of which of the three red rose amigos is the best individual player as who would be the snuggest fit right now for an underperforming England side in need of more direction. And if an imperious Ford somehow navigates Sale past Farrell and Saracens on Saturday week, the England head coach, Steve Borthwick, may have little choice but to trust the evidence of his own eyes. Because a more controlled, clear-eyed England would instantly be a different proposition. And if Ford, whom Borthwick knows well from their Leicester days, can be that all-seeing catalyst, why would the management not pick him? In the past the argument has been that Ford’s goal-kicking has been slightly less reliable and that he is a less hard-hitting defender. Now he is nailing pretty much every kick – note how long he now stares down at the grass even as the ball bisects the distant uprights – and is displaying the all-round clarity and purpose that once led to him being crowned the world junior player of the year. So if England wish to reboot themselves without throwing everything into the mixer again (there is no longer sufficient time for that) the solution is staring them in the face. In that event the only issue would be whether Farrell should revert to No 12 alongside his good mate or sit on the bench. Both involve fudging the issue slightly – Farrell is a better 10 than he is 12 and if any back-up fly-half is perfectly equipped to conjure special something against a tiring defence in the final quarter it is surely Smith. Clearly though, there is no way England will omit Farrell from their World Cup squad, which leaves Smith as the most vulnerable of the trio. Three specialist fly-halves would be a luxury – particularly with a week’s break now a feature of the pool stages – and Henry Slade offers greater utility value with his ability to play at fly-half, centre or, in an emergency, full-back. The fact the tournament is being staged just across the Channel in France also makes it simpler to summon 11th-hour replacements if required. So, yes, one man alone is not going to win next week’s Premiership final. If Sale’s forwards, with a few ill-timed injury concerns, cannot establish any momentum, their fly-half will look as mortal as anyone else. England also still have a big choice to make at scrum-half. But Ford is one more five-star display away from transforming the landscape in terms of this autumn’s World Cup. How Farrell reacts to that challenge will be similarly fascinating.

    <head>Vodafone to cut 11,000 jobs worldwide over next three years</head>
    <body>Vodafone is to cut 11,000 jobs from its global workforce over the next three years, the largest round of cuts in the troubled telecoms group’s history. The job losses amount to more than a tenth of the 104,000 global staff employed by Vodafone. The company employs about 9,000 people in the UK, including at its headquarters in Berkshire. The cuts mark the first big move by Margherita Della Valle, appointed as Vodafone’s first female chief executive last month, who said that the company needed to be leaner and more efficient to compete against rivals. Related: Margherita Della Valle made Vodafone’s first permanent female chief executive “Our performance has not been good enough. To consistently deliver, Vodafone must change,” she said. The job losses will fall across Vodafone’s entire operations – starting with its group functions, which are based in the UK, Germany, the company’s biggest and worst-performing market, and Italy – with no indication of the scale of cuts in each market. Della Valle said Vodafone’s headquarters would become “as lean as possible”, and the restructuring plan includes a revision of staff incentive schemes throughout the business to be more closely matched with hitting performance targets. The cuts will free up an extra €100m (£87m) to be ploughed in to marketing to revitalise the Vodafone brand, and €150m to improve the customer experience. Della Valle said the savings from the job cuts would not increase a €1bn target announced in November. The wider restructuring includes a review of options for Vodafone’s Spanish business, including a potential sale. “Looking at our position in the industry and the steps we have taken in the last few years, we have probably been too incremental,” Della Valle said. Vodafone, which has about 18 million UK mobile customers and more than 1 million broadband customers, is in the closing stages of pushing through a merger with Three to create the UK’s biggest mobile company. Della Valle said she hoped a deal to reduce the number of big UK mobile operators from four to three – something that has in the past been blocked by regulators over competition issues – would be given the go-ahead. “I would say that the mood music has changed,” she said. “There is a wide understanding that the problem of returns [on investment] is preventing Europe to develop 5G networks in line with the rest of the world. We don’t have enough scale.” “My priorities are customers, simplicity and growth,” Della Valle added. “We will simplify our organisation, cutting out complexity to regain our competitiveness. We will reallocate resources to deliver the quality service our customers expect.” Shares in Vodafone fell more than 9%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, as investors reacted to the news and a forecast of a drop of €1.5bn in free cashflow this year. “Lacklustre performance has been something markets have come to expect from Vodafone of late,” said Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “The new chief executive has been very vocal about the host of challenges she’s facing in her new role. The honesty is refreshing but not enough to keep the shares falling. Markets will need to see tangible results over the coming year before they get more excited.” In November, Vodafone cut its annual profit forecast and announced a €1bn-plus cost-cutting plan, including job cuts, to cope with soaring energy bills and inflation. A month later, the company ousted the two-decade Vodafone veteran Nick Read after a 40% slump in market value during his four-year tenure as chief executive.</body>

    <head>Lemmings meets Koyaanisqatsi: Humanity, the dream-like puzzle game that inspires delight and unease</head>
    <body>Humanity was inspired by a throng of bodies. Specifically, the mass of people queueing for Comiket, the longstanding comic and pop culture convention in Tokyo. As its director Yugo Nakamura explains over a video call from the city, he was intrigued by the “orderly manner” in which these people were milling about. “We have our soul and mind,” he says, “but it was almost like they were moving without thinking.” The challenge the designer set himself and his colleagues at the award-winning Japanese studio tha ltd. was to simulate this gently surging crowd, the ebb and flow of the collective. Yugo Nakamura Photograph: - The resulting puzzle game does something unusual for the genre. Yes, it stretches your grey matter in ways that will make you feel like an idiot and then a genius, but its hundreds, sometimes thousands of people moving in unison are capable of stirring up surprising emotions: delight, awe, even fear. The setup is simple: direct an endlessly spawning mass of people towards the light in a series of self-contained levels. The execution is anything but: a luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader, scampering about brutalist architecture suspended high in the clouds. You are given the ability to manipulate the group in different ways with commands such as turn, jump, and branch, which siphons the roving mob into two. When it goes right, Humanity is the stuff of dreams; one wrong instruction, however, and the game turns into a Freudian nightmare, its mass of figures tumbling into an infinite abyss. This strange, compulsive game is the product of a collaboration between tha and Enhance, the video game studio founded by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, celebrated designer of 2001’s Rez (another game inspired by heaving bodies) and 2019’s Tetris Effect. Mizuguchi, who simply goes by “Miz” to most people who know him, first saw Humanity in 2017 while sitting on a judging panel at a Unity showcase in Tokyo, back when it was still just a tech demo. It grabbed of his attention and then wouldn’t let it go, inspiring a series of searching questions. “Where is this going? What is this trying to get to?” he recalls asking himself, over a video call from his Tokyo office. Six years on, the game elements of Humanity have been fleshed out, but its confusing emotional impact hasn’t changed. “Even today, when I see what we’ve come up with, it’s quite shocking visually,” he says. A luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader … Humanity. Illustration: THA/ Enhance Six years is a long time to spend making any kind of video game, let alone a puzzle game (for comparison, that’s how long the new open-world behemoth Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom took to produce). Nakamura admits sculpting the crystalline idea into a meaningful interactive experience was a fraught process. There was a loss in direction, a stutter in development: “To be quite honest … I didn’t even want to show up to work,” Nakamura says. Then Enhance stepped in to offer direction – how to make Humanity “interesting, fun, and entertaining to play”. Tetsuya Mizuguchi Photograph: - Mizuguchi is modest about his studio’s input, casually describing it as “helping out with level design”. Like some of the very best puzzle games in recent memory, Humanity gradually ratchets up its complexity. You navigate levels filled with inky blocks that can be pushed around, fans that suspend your minions in mid-air and then, later in the game, grey-skinned figures dressed in black called “the others”. A boldly metaphorical narrative unfolds alongside this symbolic gameplay. During one set of levels collectively titled Fate, there’s no way to alter the path of your followers once they’ve started moving, forcing you to think 10, 15, sometimes even 20 moves ahead. During these puzzles, humankind’s course is preordained. That said, Humanity is more often than not a game of improvisation and creativity, not least for players who choose to take advantage of the game’s in-built level creator. As producer Mark Macdonald explains, this also contributed to the protracted development, a feature requiring not only the development of easy-to-use tools but an entire network within which fan-made levels could be hosted, shared, and rated. “It’s kind of like creating Netflix and Twitter at the same time,” says Macdonald. During the game’s demo period in March, inventive players made levels based on the recent hit Vampire Survivors, stealth classic Metal Gear Solid, and even baseball, ideas the development team would never have conceived – in other words, “exactly what you’re hoping to see”, he says. Creating levels is as much of a puzzle as those found in the actual game. Both tickle parts of the brain that enjoy tinkering and experimentation – seeing computer software come alive thanks to human input. As such, Nakamura sees Humanity as an extension of the web design work that made his name in the late 1990s – then cutting-edge sites like MONO*craft, which took advantage of the era’s nascent Flash software. He speaks of the user coming into “touch” with a site, a “reaction”, and this generating an “aha moment”. Of course, websites tend to occupy their users’ attention for only a few minutes; video games have to sustain a player’s attention for many hours. This proved to be one of the biggest challenges for Nakamura. “I would feel that maybe [we had] enough to satisfy the user,” he says. “But I didn’t know what the upper limit was.” Ebb and flow of the collective … Humanity. Illustration: THA/ Enhance Nakamura has used the medium’s length to produce a game that is both playful and profound, evoking two works that could scarcely be more different. On the one hand, Lemmings, the seminal 1991 puzzle game that sees you leading strange tiny humanoid figures through underground environments; on the other, Godfrey Reggio’s 1982 masterpiece Koyaanisqatsi, a cinematic tone poem that casts a panoramic, God-like gaze over humanity and its increasingly fractious relationship with Earth. Reggio’s film eludes a single straightforward interpretation, and Humanity will likely inspire similar existential musings. Mark Macdonald Photograph: - For Macdonald, the Covid-19 pandemic, which occurred midway through development, cast the game in a new light. He recalls watching US coverage of the accompanying public unrest and demonstrations while working in Japan, “unlike anything I’ve ever seen in my lifetime”, he says. “Then I’m seeing these giant crowds of people [in the game] flowing, interacting, sometimes competing and fighting, and it’s surreal.” Nakamura, meanwhile, speaks philosophically of social media and the ways in which it has distorted our perspective before zeroing in on a single question: “Why do things happen when suddenly we’re part of a crowd, part of a larger society, or part of a larger community?” In the surreal, visual story he has crafted – one that only a video game could tell – a dog leads a pack of humans who have “lost their sense of direction, and maybe even hope”. Humanity is out 16 May for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PSVR, and PSVR 2</body>

    <head>Indigenous man condemns voice no campaign for claiming he is Vincent Lingiari’s grandson</head>
    <body>An Indigenous man incorrectly identified by the voice referendum no campaign as “Vincent Lingiari’s grandson” says he is not related to the land rights leader and feels “humiliated” by the way his image has been used. No voice leader Warren Mundine has stood by his campaign’s claims, claiming that Stewart Lingiari had described himself as Vincent’s grandson in a “cultural kinship” sense, rather than directly. Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney said the incident raised “real questions” about the credibility of her opponents. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mundine and shadow Indigenous Australians minister Jacinta Price, the main spokespeople for the campaign against the Indigenous voice to parliament, claimed in social media posts last month that Vincent’s grandson was “voting no” in the referendum. Vincent Lingiari led the Wave Hill walk-off of Indigenous stockmen in the Northern Territory, a key event in the Aboriginal land rights movement. In 1975 he was immortalised in an iconic photo, as prime minister Gough Whitlam poured sand into his hand to represent the handing back of land to the Gurindji people. In a reply on 22 April to a tweet from Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney quoting a supporter of the voice, Price wrote: “Vincent Lingiari’s grandson thinks otherwise”. The no campaign have serious questions to answer Linda Burney Price included a screenshot from the website for no campaign Fair Australia showing Stewart Lingiari beside a quote saying: “I don’t want you to look at me differently. That’s why I’m voting no”. Mundine, leader of the Recognise A Better Way campaign, tweeted the same screenshot on his account 40 minutes later, writing: “Vincent Lingiari’s grandson is voting No!” Speaking to Guardian Australia, Stewart confirmed he was not related to Vincent Lingiari, and had been given that surname when he was adopted as a child. Related: ‘Our voice is the spirit of this country’: connecting Yolngu parliament in Arnhem Land to Canberra “I’m not from that family. If they had asked me directly, I would have told them I’m not his grandson but they never asked me,” he said. He claimed he had not given permission for his image to be used in this way and felt “humiliated” by the episode. “Now I hear my picture is all over social media. It’s very wrong what they did, I want it to stop, I want them to take it down.” Stewart also said he did not claim to be a grandson of the land rights leader. Members of the Lingiari family told Guardian Australia they were aware of the posts. One of Vincent Lingiari’s grandchildren said they knew of Stewart but that he wasn’t a relative. Stewart Lingiari lives in Ngukurr, a small community south east of Katherine. The Lingiari family say they are from Kalkarindji, a community more than 770 km or 12 hours’ drive away. The misidentification was revealed by RMIT FactLab, a fact-checking unit based at RMIT University, which published an article on Monday quoting Stewart Lingiari as saying he wasn’t related to Vincent. Stewart was quoted in the article saying he didn’t oppose the voice, and claimed the quote attributed to him was “what the cameraman told me to say”. Stewart’s photo and quote appears on a list of eight people speaking against the voice on Fair Australia’s website. Price’s photo and quote is first, while Stewart’s is fifth. Fair Australia’s website does not claim he is Vincent Lingiari’s grandson. The photo was taken during a trip to Canberra where he met Price and Mundine, as part of a traditional owners group from the Millwarparra Aboriginal Corporation to discuss his home town Ngukurr. The group met opposition leader Peter Dutton on the visit. But Mundine insisted his description was accurate, claiming that Stewart Lingiari had described himself as Vincent’s grandson in a “cultural kinship” sense, not in a direct relative sense. “Kinship structure doesn’t mean you have to be blood related in Aboriginal communities. We have many fathers, mothers, children, grandparents. I have grandchildren but they’re not my blood relations,” Mundine said. “When [Stewart] spent two days with me, I understood that to be a kinship relationship [with Vincent]. Not a grandson like in white man country, but that’s how he was introduced to me. I understood that, I understand cultural kinship.” Mundine was critical of the factcheck article, claiming: “it’s time some of these people learned about Aboriginal culture.” Asked about Stewart’s claim he was given a script to read, Mundine responded: “I categorically say that isn’t true.” “We asked everyone to put their point of view across. There was no paperwork there, they were asked to say what they believe,” he said. Price’s office was contacted for comment. Fair Australia directed inquiries to Mundine’s comments. Burney said the issue “raises real questions about the credibility of the no campaign.” “It appears that some people have been misled into saying things on camera about constitutional recognition by the no campaign,” she told Guardian Australia.

    <head>Medea in mid-air: how Syracuse’s Greek theatre keeps the classics alive</head>
    <body>How best to stage the great Greek classics? The fashion in Britain is for intimacy. But there are other alternatives, as I found on a visit to the ancient Greek theatre in Sicily’s Syracuse where everything is on a massive scale. The auditorium, carved out of a hillside, seats 5,000. The stage is 27 metres wide and 44 deep; acting, direction and design are correspondingly epic. Yet I discovered, in the two productions I saw, that psychological detail is still achievable even in this vast arena. Seasons of the Greek classics began in Syracuse in 1914, continued spasmodically but only became annual events in this century. Scanning the records, you find that many famous directors, including Peter Stein, Luca Ronconi, Yannis Kokkos and Irene Papas, have worked there. Among the translators, the name of Pier Paolo Pasolini stands out. Each eight-week season blends a well-known title with others less familiar. This year Medea and Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound kicked off the programme, with Peace by Aristophanes and a multi-media spectacle about Ulysses still to come. After July, selected productions will go on tour around Italy. This is all the impressive work of the Istituto Nazionale Del Dramma Antico (National Institute of Ancient Drama) but I was relieved to find that a respect for the past was matched by a regard for the present. On a basic level, non-Italian speakers are offered an earpiece translation and a text in English. But my first discovery at Medea was a brilliant essay in the programme-book by the play’s translator, Massimo Fusillo, which suggests that Euripides pioneered the use of the inner monologue allowing us to get inside the protagonist’s head. Fusillo argues that this leads ultimately to Macbeth, Milton’s Satan and modern TV series such as Breaking Bad and Gomorrah. The play’s director, Federico Tiezzi, goes further by saying he sees Medea as “a clash between an archaic society and a post-industrial society” and compares Jason to the “great boisterous Ibsen titans from John Gabriel Borkman to Torvald Helmer in A Doll’s House”. Pioneering inner monologue … a scene from Medea at Syracuse. Photograph: Aliffi/PR All this is heady stuff but how does it work in practice? Tiezzi goes out of his way to stress the symbolic nature of the conflict in which Medea is told that she will be forced to leave Corinth never to see Jason or her children again. Medea initially sports a fearsome bird-like headpiece, her children wear fluffy rabbit-heads and Creon, the king of Corinth, a crocodile-mask. The female chorus, meanwhile, are blue-clad skivvies with pails and scrubbing-brushes. But the great revelation comes in the relationship between Medea and Jason. I’ve seen many fine British productions, including those starring Fiona Shaw, Helen McCrory and Sophie Okonedo, in which you feel Medea is driven to violence by a brutal male power structure. But in the performances of Laura Marinoni as Medea and Alessandro Averone as Jason I saw something I had never quite grasped before: that the two characters are still passionately in love. There is an extraordinary scene where Jason argues that his impending marriage to Creon’s daughter is purely political. As he says this, he sensuously caresses Medea. Her response is to angrily bite his hand, call him a “bastardo” and then give him a feverishly prolonged kiss. This lends the tragedy a new complexity and suggest there is a love-hate intensity to the Medea-Jason relationship that brings to mind Strindberg’s A Dance of Death or even Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The production still has an operatic quality. Marinoni delivers her great monologues with blazing ferocity and Sandra Toffolatti as the Messenger who brings the news of Medea’s child-murder shows a similar rhetorical power. There is also one last moment of jaw-dropping spectacle. At the climax we see Medea in an airborne chariot with her dead sons beside her: not since a famous 1987 production by Yukio Ninagawa have I seen Medea take to the skies. But I shall remember this version less for its spectacle than for its stark realisation that revenge and love are two sides of the same coin. Alessandro Albertin as Prometheus Photograph: PR Prometheus Bound is a more problematic piece. It deals with the punishment of Prometheus by Zeus for having stolen fire from Olympus and given it to the human race. But, since the hero is throughout chained to a rock, the play is unavoidably static and seems more like a dramatic poem akin to Milton’s Samson Agonistes. It is also part of a trilogy of which two thirds is lost. There are even arguments as to whether the play really is by Aeschylus. Yet it had a strong influence on Shelley, Byron and Goethe and possibly even on Beckett in that there are parallels between its enchained hero and the earthbound Winnie in Happy Days. The big question is how to make it work theatrically. Leo Muscato’s production starts with the advantage of a massive set by Federica Parolini: one that suggests a decaying industrial landscape filled with rusting pipes, railway tracks, ancient tunnels and even a giant chimney-stack to which Prometheus is permanently bound. Even if the protagonist is going nowhere, he is surrounded elsewhere by movement: the chorus roams ceaselessly, Hermes makes his entrance on a piece of rolling-stock and Io, changed into a cow by Zeus for failing to respond to his advances, arrives and departs scrambling up and down the theatre aisles on all fours. Everything is done to give the play a physical dynamism. Monotony is also kept at bay by the performance of Alessandro Albertin as Prometheus. He conveys the pride of Prometheus in giving to humanity art, technology, logic and sentiment: “I sowed blind hope in their hearts,” he boasts. But there is also anger, defiance and a fierce resentment of injustice in his performance. Prometheus directs his rage towards Zeus but he becomes, in Albertin’s performance, a living symbol of resistance to oppression reminding one that the character was once dubbed “the patron saint of the proletariat”. While I found a contemporary resonance in both Medea and Prometheus, how does an institution like Syracuse’s Greek Theatre renew itself? It has no single artistic director but a complex structure in which a managing director and a superintendent, currently both women, make recommendations to a five-strong board. But although the superintendent, Valeria Told, has only been in office a few weeks, she is bursting with ideas for the future. “I believe,” she said, “we need to have a three-year-plan taking us up to 2026. I’d like to have co-productions with other theatres whereby we tour scaled-down versions of our work in the style of Welsh National Opera. I’d also like to bring in more foreign directors, especially from the world of opera, take our productions to Greece, Spain and France which have comparable amphitheatres, attract a more international audience and extend our season beyond eight weeks.” The Greek theatre in Syracuse. Photograph: Gaspare Urso Told is nothing if not bold but she has the pragmatic idealism that you often find in artistic enterprises. She has inherited a stable organisation with a budget of €8.5m, 70% of which comes from box-office and donations, 30% from state and local funding. She also emphasises that ticket prices are modest, ranging from €15 to €70, and that it is estimated that the theatre generates seven times its budget in terms of spending on hotels, restaurants and, she intriguingly adds, “hairdressers”. There is no doubt Syracuse’s Greek theatre is a vibrant concern. Attendance there has the quality of ritual. The productions clearly satisfy our hunger for spectacle. But I would suggest that its future, given that it has an available repertory of 90 works, depends on its ability to find new meanings in old plays. “Every generation fashions the classics for itself,” a great critic, AB Walkley, once wrote; and that is as true of Syracuse as it is of Stratford-upon-Avon. The Greek theatre’s summer programme runs until 2 July in Syracuse. Michael Billington’s trip to Syracuse was provided by the National Institute of Ancient Drama.</body>

    <head>‘What did the pope know?’: Poles divided over John Paul II abuse cover-up claims</head>
    <body>With under six months to go before a parliamentary election that is expected to be closely fought, a surprise figure has entered the Polish political field, despite the fact he died in 2005: Pope John Paul II. The legacy of John Paul II, who was born Karol Wojtyła and was archbishop of Kraków before becoming pope in 1978, is under scrutiny after a recent book and television documentary accused him of covering up for paedophile priests before he became pontiff. Poland, historically staunchly Catholic, has slowly been coming to terms with the scale of historical sexual abuse in the church, but until recently the figure of John Paul II, whom many Poles revere for his role in the ending of communist rule in the country, has remained untouchable. That convention has been upturned by allegations in a documentary aired on Polish television station TVN earlier this year, and a concurrent book by the Dutch journalist Ekke Overbeek, who has lived in Poland for more than two decades and written extensively on child abuse in the Polish church. Activists hold a banner reading ‘Catholic Church Guilty’ during a protest in Krakow in March against members of the Catholic hierarchy, including Pope John Paul II, accusing them of covering up sex abuse. Photograph: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock Overbeek said he found documents in the archives of the communist-era security services that prove beyond doubt that the sexual abuse of children by priests was an issue during Wojtyła’s tenure as archbishop of Kraków, and that the future pope helped to cover it up. “It’s obvious from the documents that he knew about the abuse. He reacted to it by allowing the priests to continue their ministry. He was very forgiving towards the priests, whereas no evidence shows that he ever gave attention to the victims,” said Overbeek, in an interview at a Warsaw cafe. The response to the allegations has been one of denial and fury. Two public events to promote the book were cancelled by the publishers, citing security fears after a sustained campaign against Overbeek in government media. In the Polish parliament, the Sejm, MPs from the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party arrived for a session in March holding photographs of the late pope, and passed a resolution to defend his name. “The Sejm … strongly condemns the shameful media campaign, based largely on the materials of the communist apparatus of violence, whose object is the Great Pope – Saint John Paul II, the greatest Pole in history,” the resolution read. Pope John Paul II waving to a crowd at the end of a holy mass in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz in June 1999. Photograph: Jerry Lampen/Reuters Wojtyła was born in the town of Wadowice in 1920; he was ordained in 1946 and made archbishop of Kraków in the early 1960s. He would become the first non-Italian pope for more than four centuries, and made several visits back to Poland as pontiff. He was widely credited with galvanising opposition to communist rule and continued as pope until his death in 2005. “I was very upset when I watched the documentary,” said Sławomir Abramowski, the 58-year-old priest in charge of a parish named after John Paul II in Bemowo, a neighbourhood of Warsaw. The church was built shortly after the church canonised John Paul II in 2014, and has a portrait of the late pope close to the altar no smaller than the images of Jesus. The documentary used a “crude manipulation of the facts” to smear John Paul II, said Abramowski, who credited the late pope with inspiring him to join the church in the early 1990s, after he had trained as a doctor. Among his congregation on a recent Sunday, when the church was full for mass and worshippers listened via speakers in an overflow area outside, there was a mood of defiance. Kamila, a 38-year-old woman carrying a baby, claimed John Paul II was a “huge opponent of paedophilia” and said the accusations were political. “The aim of this game is to discourage people from going to church, to destroy Polish identity and to repel people from family values.” Barbara, a 70-year-old worshipper, said it was unfair to make accusations against someone who was dead and thus could not defend himself. “The ones who accused him should think about their conscience. I think they might have had problems in their childhood and have been doing this to boost their deficient self-worth,” she said. This strength of feeling helps explain why PiS have seized on the topic, before parliamentary elections in October that are delicately poised. A PiS-led coalition has ruled Poland since 2015, and draws much of its support from a rural, staunchly Catholic electorate. Mateusz Klinowski, the former mayor of Wojtyła’s hometown, Wadowice, and an outspoken critic of the church, said he had no doubt the allegations against John Paul II were true. “Among educated people, it’s been obvious for a long time that he was covering it up, but of course for politicians it’s a sweet piece of cake for preparing their campaigns,” he said. Jacek Karnowski, the editor-in-chief of the pro-government Sieci magazine, said he expected the pope’s legacy to be one of three key issues the government would focus on in the upcoming election campaign, along with cost of living and the war in Ukraine. “They know that on the abortion issue, the majority is against them so they stay silent. But 74% of Poles say John Paul II is an authority so this is very fertile ground for the government,” he said. In early April, thousands of people joined marches in Warsaw and other cities to defend the pope’s name, including the defence minister and the head of the constitutional court.

Photograph: Piotr Łapiński/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock Karnowski claimed the whole scandal had been part of a “political attack” on John Paul II coordinated by the liberal opposition to PiS, but others say that the opposition has been blindsided by the allegations and is trying to stay neutral, aware of how sensitive the issue is. A poll also showed that nearly half of Poles said they would not want to hear allegations against John Paul II even if they were true. Even the editor-in-chief of Wyborcza, Poland’s leading liberal newspaper, has said it would be wrong to discredit the Pope’s historical role. “Wojtyła was a child of his time. And what is obvious to us today was not obvious 40 years ago,” said Adam Michnik, in an interview published in his own newspaper. John Paul II’s papacy, which lasted more than a quarter of a century, coincided with the first public scandals about sexual abuse in the Catholic church, which have since broken in numerous countries. Often, culprits were simply moved to different parishes rather than banned from practicing or reported to police. “Ever since these scandals broke, the question has always been ‘How much did the pope know?’” said Overbeek. “The answer was in Poland, and now we have the answer. He was aware of this issue from the very beginning.” It is a conclusion that a lot of people in Poland don’t want to hear, fearing the accusations could undermine John Paul II’s role as part of Polish history and his reputation as one of the key figures in the defeat of communism. “Poland doesn’t have many recent characters we can use as role models. That’s why people are so eager to defend him,” said Klinowski.</body>

    <head>Republicans aren’t fixing the migrant border plight. In fact they’re making it worse</head>
    <body>Last week saw the end of Title 42, the Trump-era border restriction which was technically introduced as a health measure during the coronavirus pandemic. The policy allowed the Trump and then Biden administrations to expel without due process the vast majority of people seeking asylum at the United States-Mexico border. Given that the acute phase of the pandemic has passed, the end of the policy – which has been used about 2.7m times – was inevitable. Related: The US’s ‘immigration crisis’ is admitting too few immigrants, not too many | Deepak Bhargava and Rich Stolz But the end of Title 42 has also reignited the political firestorm over the US immigration and refugee system. Republicans have seemed to gleefully anticipate “chaos” and “disaster” at the border after the policy is lifted. Less biased observers are also concerned that the US refugee processing system will be overwhelmed by the sheer scale of people now expected to seek asylum. The Biden administration has come under fierce criticism from the left for a tough new policy of questionable legality which requires most refugees to seek asylum from abroad using a glitchy cellphone app called CBP One. Not to be outdone, Republicans have responded to the situation by promising to return to the failed and cruel policies of the past. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has passed a bill which would order the resumption of Trump’s border wall and eviscerate the right to asylum for those who reach the US. Meanwhile, speaking at a CNN town hall last week, Trump defended his policy of family separation and indicated that he would consider reinstating it if he became president again. All of these proposals show that even though there are many reasons to be concerned about the humanitarian situation at the southern border, Republicans have no solutions to it. Migration is driven by human suffering and the desire for a better and safer life, rooted in structural factors like the climate crisis, human rights violations and economic inequality. US government policies have some impact, but they’re not determinative. If people could be prevented from seeking asylum through angry posturing or cruel policies like family separation, then it’s hard to explain why 2019 – a year when Trump was president – saw the largest number of arrivals in 12 years. What’s even worse is that the policies that Republicans want to pursue in other areas of life only make the structural factors underlying migration more severe. The party is opposed to serious efforts to tackle the climate crisis, and it cut foreign aid to Central America under Trump – in some cases actually as punishment for the arrival of migrants at the border. Furthermore, the weak US gun laws which Republicans back create an “iron river” of firearms flowing into Mexico and Central America, where 70% and 50% of guns used in crimes are traced back to the US. The party also has a long history of promoting US military intervention in Latin America, which has caused instability and propped up the regimes that fuel the inequality and violence of today. Republicans are busy right now proposing that the US invade Mexico to take out its drug cartels, an action that would contribute to the country’s insecurity and undoubtedly fuel an increase in migration northwards. If Republicans wanted to actually help deal with the refugee crisis, there are many things they could do. They could join with Democrats to properly fund the system of refugee centers, in which the number of detainees is already exceeding capacity, and immigration courts, where some refugees have been waiting more than a decade for a hearing. They could try to advance proposals to work constructively with the nations with which the United States shares a hemisphere to tackle common problems like the climate crisis, economic inequality and gun violence. And they could work to expand, rather than contract, legal pathways to citizenship and asylum. The Biden administration is now working to do just that, announcing plans to set up immigration processing centers throughout Latin America, with the first to open in Guatemala and Colombia in the coming weeks. Eventually, the administration hopes to reduce the need for desperate people to arrive at the border by offering them an opportunity to apply for asylum from elsewhere. This should not only dial down the political heat at home, but much more importantly mean that would-be migrants don’t have to suffer the harrowing journey north, which for many ends in abuse or death. But these plans can only be effective and sustainable over the long term with the cooperation of Republicans, both in Congress and in future administrations. For that to happen, the party would need to start seeing immigrants and refugees as fellow human beings in need of assistance rather than as enemies to be quashed. Only then can America really make progress in tackling this problem and escaping the cycle of cruelty in which it is currently trapped.

    <head>Smaller classes and global friendships: studying online for the International Baccalaureate Diploma</head>
    <body>Speaking to María Delgado Álvarez on the phone from the small city of Huesca, Spain, it’s clear that she has a global outlook when it comes to her studies. “If people here go to university, they go to local universities to study humanities. When you tell anyone that you want to study pure mathematics, they look at you with a strange expression,” she says. But thanks to King’s InterHigh – an online school – and its International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), Delgado Álvarez is part of an international cohort, has friends around the world, and she has her sights firmly set on the world’s top universities. Since studying for the IBDP – which is a two-year course – at King’s InterHigh, “traditional” school feels like a distant memory to Delgado Álvarez. “I was enrolled in a bricks and mortar school in my city,” she says. “But online school is so much better. There’s an innovative approach using emerging technologies, and having an international class means we interact with different cultures and beliefs, and we all have different areas of interest. That’s better than all being from the same place.” The format of learning is also innovative. The classes connect to video conferences and teachers don’t just explain the subject. Instead, for each topic, the first class is called an inquiry. “You don’t get exposed to the topic [instantly], so you have to discover for yourself why it’s important,” says Delgado Álvarez. Then, there’s a knowledge session, where the teacher explains the formal side of the subject. Next, the pupils go on to the experience class, where they use different methods – such as quizzes – to test their knowledge, she says, and this is followed by “assessment lessons to check how we’re doing and if we need to revise something”. Classes are smaller than traditionally. There are never more than 20 students in a class and, as students get to select classes and opt for the higher or standard level of each subject, most classes end up having about 10 students in them. María Delgado Álvarez: ‘Online school is so much better.’ Photograph: handout Aside from the IBDP – which is an alternative to A-levels for students aged 16 to 19 – King’s InterHigh offers a number of other qualifications, following the British curriculum of iGCSEs and A-levels, to children aged seven to 19. The school enables students around the world to access an education that might otherwise be inaccessible, for reasons such as geography, learning approach, or language. “For many students and families, an online IB education is the precise solution to their needs and preferences,” says Nicholas Wergen, global education director at Inspired Education, an international provider of private schools. Alessandro Capozzi, head of sixth form at King’s InterHigh, says there’s a certain criteria that needs to be met when applying to study the IBDP. “Students need to have a clutch of good GCSEs, at grade 6 or above, and it is beneficial to have been successful in previous studies to be able to cope with the rigours of the IB. It’s a broader qualification than A-levels, with more contact hours, and can prepare students effectively for university and the world of work.” The students at King’s InterHigh are driven, motivated and want to do really well, says Capozzi. “You don’t have the distractions you would expect in a physical school, and students can study at the pace they want to. Students can get into a rhythm that they maybe didn’t have previously, learn faster than at a mainstream school and even pursue a sport or enterprise, fitting their studies around commitments.” Related: ‘I found a school where I could be myself’: how online learning was the answer for House of the Dragon star For Delgado Álvarez, one of the most positive things about studying online is getting to use new technologies. “Besides virtual reality, which is so cool, you can see your school in the metaverse, and we go to classes over there. It’s so amazing because we don’t have the limitation of reality. In physics, we play within different gravities, in economics we go inside businesses and understand how they work.” There are also more than 80 extracurricular clubs, from yoga and gardening, to oil painting and future tech. Though students aren’t in a physical space where they can interact with other students daily, there’s still endless opportunities to get to know fellow students and to make new friends. “I started making friends from the very first day. We have a peer tutoring system that we use within our cohort, where students explain subjects they are proficient in,” says Delgado Álvarez. Wergen agrees: “We’re creating a genuinely global cohort of IB students working together as one class but based all around the world.” And the students will have opportunities throughout the year to catch up with their classmates in person – from a class trip in Croatia, for instance, to the option of summer camps all over the world. Delgado Álvarez is aiming for the best. And this, she says, is what the IB does – it makes you feel that you can go anywhere in the world, that you’re learning to be a global citizen. “I think the IB and online school is the future of education.” King’s InterHigh is now enrolling for its fully online IB Diploma Programme for September 2023.

    <head>‘I found a school where I could be myself’: how online learning was the answer for House of the Dragon star</head>
    <body>Online learning is becoming more common than ever. With a multitude of benefits – such as allowing students to take classes from wherever they are – studying online has become a viable alternative to conventional learning. And there are many reasons why a student might choose to study online. From students following their dream careers, to those who struggle in mainstream school, and children from expat families who are constantly travelling, online learning allows young people to continue their education – and enjoy it. Maddie Evans, recently seen on screen as Dyana in the Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon, is a student at online school King’s InterHigh. “The flexibility of online learning has been a lifesaver. I did GCSEs last year, and without King’s InterHigh, I would have been a sinking ship.” All online lessons are recorded, so if Evans, who is now studying for A-levels in English language, business studies and film studies, needs to miss one because she’s on set, or at an audition, she can simply catch up later. “It’s really accessible – the learning platform is so easy to use,” the 16-year-old says. “The teachers are great – they make sure all the lessons are engaging, and give you all the information you need.” Her acting coach and mentor, Dominique Moore, is full of praise for the way King’s InterHigh’s approach allows young actors to fulfil their academic potential. But for Evans, online learning has been about more than juggling a budding acting career with her education. “Until now, I hadn’t found a school where I felt I could properly be myself,” she says. Personalised timetables allow pupils with special educational or additional learning needs to work at their own pace, while calm virtual classrooms eradicate the noisy chatter and other challenges that can disrupt students’ learning in a bricks and mortar school. And for young people afflicted by school anxiety or mental health issues, switching to online learning can be a life-changing step. Alison Manser’s 15-year-old daughter had experienced debilitating anxiety since primary school, suffering frequent panic attacks and struggling to sleep. Constantly missing lessons left her falling behind, but the family felt there was little understanding or help offered at her mainstream school. House of the Dragon star Maddie Evans (right) values the flexibility afforded by online learning. Photograph: HBO When her daughter’s situation reached a crisis point, Manser decided to move her to an online learning alternative. “It’s been wonderful,” Manser says. “Immediately, she started to sleep better. She started to smile, she started to engage with us.” Her daughter benefits from being able to take a break during the day if necessary and catch up later with a recorded lesson, and she is able to join lessons with her camera and microphone off if she wishes. “She absolutely loves it because it’s a very non-threatening environment,” Manser says. “The teachers are so kind. Nobody is put on the spot – their approach is so different.” Her daughter hasn’t had a panic attack since leaving mainstream school. “She’s thriving,” Manser says. “She’s free to just be herself. And that’s the most important thing for her.” For table tennis player Anna Hursey, who, in 2018, at the age of 11, became the youngest athlete ever to compete in the Commonwealth Games, joining King’s InterHigh has made school manageable again. “I used to go to a traditional school and I found it really hard to keep up with the schoolwork because of the travelling I did,” Hursey, now 16, says. “King’s InterHigh was really there for me. I wouldn’t be able to achieve everything that I do without them, because I can still keep up with my education and travel abroad to competitions. And I really enjoy it.” Training for four to six hours a day means Hursey, who is studying for A-levels in psychology and Chinese, sometimes relies on recorded lessons. But if she has questions, there’s always support on hand. “I can email my teacher any time and they always get back to me really quickly,” she says. Related: ‘Students can even go inside an active volcano’: how VR enhances education Vegan TV chef Omari McQueen, the host of CBBC’s What’s Cooking Omari? – another student at King’s InterHigh – also has high praise for his teachers. “They’re very helpful,” the 14-year-old says. Plus, he adds, the lessons are fun: “You get to interact with the teacher a lot. You get to choose if you want your camera on. And then the teacher will always make a joke to liven up the classroom.” The school has enabled him to balance his filming schedule and other commitments with his education. “I really love learning, so it’s important to me,” he says. “I don’t miss out on anything.” And that includes the social side of school life: “You get to make friends in the [online] classroom, but they also set these things up where you can meet each other face to face,” he says. As well as A-levels, pupils at King’s InterHigh can study for a number of other qualifications online – such as the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. For Evans, continuing her education beyond GCSEs, alongside acting, was vital. “I want to know more about the world,” she says. And she values the focus on self-discipline and the time management skills that come with online learning, too. “I like how we don’t get spoon fed,” she says. “I really like doing it myself, knowing that I’ve got the responsibility here. It feels more like life than just school.” King’s InterHigh is a leading British and international online school.

    <head>The women wearing ‘subway T-shirts’ over outfits to avoid creepy stares</head>
    <body>On a recent 80-degree Saturday in New York, Claire Wenrick decided to hang out on a friend’s roof. She slipped into a vintage baby blue tank top and camouflage miniskirt for the occasion. But before she left for the day, she grabbed an extra-large white T-shirt to cover it all up. It’s a trick the 24-year-old content creator learned from TikTok: use a dumpy “subway shirt” to conceal the actual outfit you plan to wear out. It will keep creeps from staring during the commute. “It’s a way to protect my safety getting from point A to point B,” Wenrick said. “I don’t want to become a target, as weird as that sounds.” New Yorkers love to shed their winter layers as soon as the first signs of spring hit the city. But for women who take advantage of sundress season, the much-anticipated warm weather can also bring unwanted attention. Not that it should. There is little evidence that harassment or assault is motivated by what a victim wears, and clothing is never a justification for cat-calling. Still, anyone who does not want to risk it may utilize the subway shirt, which is also known colloquially as an “outfit dampener”. Everyone has a subway shirt in their closet: a baggy, shapeless cover-up meant to divert eyeballs away from the body. As one creator wrote on the app: “It’s an oversized shirt we wear over cute outfits so strange men don’t bother you on the train.” “Just know if you see me in a white button down, the real fit is underneath,” another woman commented. “I wish I didn’t have to wear one and that it was safe to be able to wear what I want,” Wenrick said. “It feels like I’m going back to a middle school dress code as an adult – continuing to dress so that men leave me alone.” Ajana Grove, who is 19, moved to New York from Nebraska. “I learned quickly that I can walk around and do what I want to as long as I’m covered up,” she said. “Every time I forget my subway shirt, I instantly regret it and think about turning around.” Grove has a few dedicated shirts she tries to keep in her bag, and she encourages her friends to do the same. “I’ve noticed it since I moved here – the male gaze is a physical feeling,” she said. “Even if I’m not paying attention, if someone’s staring at me, I feel it.” Leora Tanenbaum is the author of I Am Not a Slut: Slut-Shaming in the Age of the Internet. She also documents racist and sexist school dress codes on her Instagram account. “I think it’s fantastic these TikToks are raising awareness of the harm caused by sexual harassment and assault in public spaces,” Tanenbaum said. “Hopefully, more people now will recognize how scary it can be to simply go about your day, including taking the subway, when you present as feminine.” While covering up might make women feel less vulnerable, Tanenbaum adds that is should never be a requirement. “If someone does not wear a ‘subway shirt’ over their tank top and is victimized, they did nothing wrong.” Though New York is one of the safest large cities in the US, the New York Times found that rates of violent crime on the subway have increased since 2019. More women are avoiding public transit if they can help it: a survey of MTA customers released in February found that 41% of respondents were using subways less frequently. Of those people, 44% said this was due to personal safety concerns. Though she would prefer to dress how she pleases, Wenrick said that she and her friends made light of the subway shirt. Sometimes, they’ll all show up to parties in their gigantic T-shirts and dramatically reveal the outfit underneath. “We like to joke about the big reveal,” she said. “That’s become a big question: when do you take the subway shirt off? While you’re in line for the event? Right as you walk in? In the bathroom? Everyone thinks I just came in this huge shirt, but then, oooh, look at my cute top.” This article was amended on 16 May 2023. An earlier version misspelled Claire Wenrick’s last name.</body>

    <head>Plastic pollution could be slashed by 80% by 2040, UN says</head>
    <body>Global plastic pollution could be slashed by 80% by 2040, according to a report from the UN Environment Programme (Unep). The changes needed are major, but are also practical and affordable, the agency said. The first step is to eliminate unnecessary plastics, such as excessive packaging, the report said. Then next steps are to increase the reuse of plastics, such as refillable bottles, boosting recycling and replace plastics with greener alternatives. Such a shift, driven by government policies and changes in the plastic industry, would mean plastic pollution would drop to about 40m tons in 2040, rather than 227m tons if no action is taken. The changes would bring benefits worth trillions of dollars between now and 2040, the report said, by reducing the damage caused by plastics to health, the climate and the environment. Plastic now contaminates the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People consume microplastics via food and water, as well as breathing them in, and the particles have been found in people’s blood and breast milk. In March 2022, 193 countries agreed to end plastic pollution, with negotiations on a legally binding agreement by 2024 now under way, hosted by Unep. The second round of negotiations starts on 29 May. The world currently produces 430m tons of plastics a year, two-thirds of which are short-lived products that soon become waste. Production is set to triple by 2060 on current trends. “The way we produce, use and dispose of plastics is polluting ecosystems, creating risks for human health and destabilising the climate,” said Inger Andersen, Unep’s executive director. “This report lays out a roadmap to dramatically reduce these risks through adopting a circular approach that keeps plastics out of ecosystems, out of our bodies and in the economy. “Crucially, the report demonstrates that the transformation would provide economic and social wins. Governments and the private sector would save money and hundreds of thousands of new jobs would be created,” she said. The report estimated that the increased reuse of plastics could reduce 30% of plastic pollution by 2040, with measures including deposit-return schemes for containers. Such a scheme is due to start in England in 2025, seven years after it was first announced. More recycling would cut pollution in 2040 by a further 20%, the report said. Taxing virgin plastic and removing fossil fuel subsidies are policies that would encourage this, by making recycling more economically attractive compared with producing new plastic. Enforcing packaging guidelines to increase the recyclability of products would also be important. The careful replacement of plastic products, such as takeaway food containers, with alternative materials such as paper or compostable materials could cut another 17% from pollution in 2040, the report said. Plastic items from takeaway food and drink dominate the litter in the world’s oceans, according to a 2021 study. There would still be a lot of plastic waste to be disposed of safely in 2040, and making manufacturers responsible for this would help, the Unep report said. The report indicates that the combination of cost savings from producing less plastic and increased revenues from selling recycled plastic would reduce industry costs significantly. The investment needed for the overall shift would be substantial, at $65bn (£51bn) a year, the report said, but that is only about half of what is already invested by the plastic industry. The UN report estimated that over the next 20 years, cutting plastic pollution by 80% would prevent damage valued at more than $3tn, including impacts on health, climate, air pollution, the ocean environment and legal costs for cases brought against plastic companies. In particular, the 80% cut would prevent 500m tons of CO2 emissions per year, the report estimated, about the same as the emissions of Canada. This shift could also lead to a net increase of 700,000 jobs by 2040, mostly in low-income countries, the report said. Andersen said the report was intended to inform the countries negotiating for a global plastic treaty of the options available. She said she was optimistic that a global deal could be reached in 2024: “There is a lot of determination from so many sides, north, west, east and south. [Ending plastic pollution] is a thing that people want as it is a problem wherever you are. “There will still be a need for plastic,” she said. “But we need to rethink where we’re using it and how we’re using it, so that much more of it [is reused and recycled] and a lot less is merely single-use.”</body>

    <head>Re:cycle of the Penguindrum review – anime tombola of characters and timelines</head>
    <body>As is often the way with bowdlerised cinema adaptations of long-running anime series, the two-part version of Penguindrum – which originally occupied 24 episodes in 2011 – drops us into a tombola of characters and timelines of screaming import for the initiated, but which are overwhelming for newcomers. It’s a shame because wading through the almost four-and-a-half hours here reveals a rich, ambitious work with frequently ravishing animation that, better paced, might have insinuated, not hectored, its way into our affections. Teenager Himari (voiced by Miho Arakawa) collapses and dies on an aquarium visit, and she is revived thanks to the magical penguin hat she bought in the souvenir shop – it links her lifeforce to a rubber-clad dominatrix spirit in another dimension. In return for keeping her alive, it demands that Himari’s brothers, Shoma (Ryōhei Kimura) and Kanba (Subaru Kimura), retrieve a powerful totem, the Penguindrum; they assume it to be the secret diary hoarded by schoolgirl Ringo, whose entries appear to predict people’s destinies. As she is planning to use it to seduce her teacher Tabuki, however, Ringo isn’t about to hand it over. Chopped up every five minutes with flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood, where Shoma and Kanba already seem to have been earmarked in some kind of cosmic library for great things – as well as Himari transporting us to her own nether-realm by yelling “Survival tactic!” – it makes as much sense as Bez on a three-day bender. But things do eventually cohere: the broadly comic first part (that is, if Ringo trying to rape Tabuki is your idea of comedy) gives way to a darker second, when the brooding Kanba resorts to collaborating with their parents’ nihilist terrorist cult in order to to save Himari. Well done if you gleaned that this is a reference to the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo subway attack. Director Kunihiko Ikuhara, best known for the seminal Sailor Moon, obviously has metaphysical matters on his mind; the flitting between realms and empathetic regard for characters’ inner worlds is reminiscent of Neil Gaiman’s Sandman. He backs it up with a startling panoply of visual registers, from hyper-real segments to Satoshi Kon-esque surrealism and abstraction, to cherubic figurework in the childhood episodes. All this madness seems to be saying that extremism is rooted in a misplaced nostalgia for innocence. But probably best to go back to the original series for the full statement. • Re:cycle of the Penguindrum is screening on 20 May in cinemas.</body>

    <head>‘Students can even go inside an active volcano’: how VR enhances education</head>
    <body>From taking a trip to Mars to holding a human brain in her hands, it’s fair to say that 16-year-old Kaleigh Carmine has had some remarkable experiences at school, all thanks to virtual reality (VR). “In science we can do experiments that would be too dangerous in real life,” she says. “I loved the biology lesson when we got to step inside a cell. It really helped me to understand the structure.” Carmine is American but has lived in South Korea, the Netherlands and Qatar over the past four years. Her parents are both university professors who frequently move for work. Recently, they returned to California but Carmine was apprehensive about going to a US school and wanted to continue studying for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) she started in the Netherlands. Attending the online school King’s InterHigh, which offers the first fully integrated online IBDP, seemed like “an amazing opportunity”, she says. “It’s much better than anything I’d experienced when learning online during Covid. I think that has a lot to do with the technology and tools the school uses. It’s that extra step, which makes it feel like actual school.” King’s InterHigh, which was established in 2005, saw an increased demand from students who were interested in online learning during the pandemic. And the numbers are continuing to rise, says Nathan O’Grady, the school’s VR, AR and E-sports lead. The school now has more than 4,000 students around the world and more than 200 teachers. Some students join because mainstream school isn’t the right fit for them, whether that’s because of bullying, anxiety or other additional needs. They might be academically gifted, or looking for flexibility to balance schooling with passions and careers. Others, such as Carmine, move a lot, or just prefer the distraction-free online learning environment. O’Grady began at the school as a teacher of geography and history from his home in Hereford, and now works full time as part of the school’s innovation team. The team’s efforts helped King’s InterHigh to win the Educational Establishment of the Year award at the 2020 Education Resources awards. “What’s really nice about this school is they’re very open to trying things out,” he says. IBDP student Kaleigh Carmine: ‘I loved the biology lesson when we got to step inside a cell.’ Photograph: Handout Almost two thirds of UK teachers who took part in a study acknowledge that technology is a critical learning tool, although they’re concerned about access to digital tools and the need to be upskilled. It’s something that parents want incorporated into lessons too. Over the next five years, 55% of the UK parents who took part in the same study believe VR and social gaming will play a key role in shaping education. There’s evidence to show that learning in VR is more effective – in a workplace training study by PwC, researchers found that VR participants completed training four times faster compared with the classroom cohort, and were more focused overall. O’Grady says it was his experience as a geography teacher that first inspired him to try VR in class. “We’ve got 4,000 kids around the world; it’s not easy for us to go on a field trip. But if they put on a headset, we can take them anywhere we want … even to the inside of an active volcano. That’s something that would be impossible for any school to do outside of virtual reality.” A history lesson that stands out was when the students toured the annex where Anne Frank and her family hid during the second world war. “It was a breakthrough moment where we really saw how VR was going to work for learning. The kids came out and they could respond to challenging questions about what they’d seen. They were able to develop emotive responses, and truly understand feelings such as claustrophobia. That’s not an experience you can have unless you’re actually there – and certainly not from a textbook.” Every IBDP student is required to have a VR headset as part of the course. There’s also a virtual science lab, art classes and language classes, where students can practise their language skills in a virtual restaurant abroad. VR isn’t used in every lesson, but O’Grady says it can be used to enhance every subject. “I always say to teachers: ‘You’ve got the ability to create the perfect classroom for any lesson you teach.’ And it’s a way that students want to learn.” Although some teachers are initially unfamiliar with the possibilities, those who try it are quickly converted and have reported that quieter students are more open to getting involved in VR. “We’ve got kids who are less confident in contributing within traditional classrooms. But when they have an avatar in these virtual worlds, it seems to create just enough separation that they feel safe and confident to interact,” O’Grady says. In Germany, another IBDP student, Johnathan Allen, lives in a small village near Stuttgart. His father works for Nato and Allen started at King’s InterHigh a year ago. “I tell my friends that I took a blind leap off the cliff and landed on a pile of mattresses,” he says. “I’m very lucky that I don’t find it difficult to socialise, learn and complete group work online as part of the King’s InterHigh community. It’s been a very smooth transition. And I love sleeping in, in the morning. School is on UK time so it starts at 9.30am for me, which is absolutely amazing.” The 17-year-old’s favourite subject is theory of knowledge, which is similar to philosophy. He has friends from the US, Morocco, South Korea, Norway and beyond, and says the diversity of the student body has led to some really interesting conversations in class. “You get so many different viewpoints. I often wish those discussions could go on for longer,” he says. “I’ve found this cohort the most international and economically diverse by far. It’s much more inclusive.” Related: An alternative to A-levels: seven things you should know about the International Baccalaureate Diploma Allen has used VR in history and business class, as well as French, where a program called ImmerseMe evaluates his pronunciation. In terms of extra curricular activities, he’s founded a Dungeons &amp; Dragons group and attends a book club. “Experience with technology is very helpful,” he says. “But the ability to interest yourself in a subject and stay focused during lessons is really crucial.” King’s InterHigh is part of the Inspired Education Group, which is made up of more than 80 schools worldwide. The group is also making developments in the education technology space by launching a completely virtual metaverse school, which connects students and teachers across a worldwide network. “If we’ve got a teacher who’s a specialist in archaeology, for example, and 20 students are interested, we can connect them and run a specialist lesson with that teacher,” O’Grady says. “It’s going to be a gamechanger.” “There are still a lot of people who think an online school is just a lecture with webcams, but there’s so much more to it,” he says. “It’s a completely different type of education that for some students is much more applicable to their needs.” King’s InterHigh is now enrolling for its fully online IB Diploma Programme for September 2023.

    <head>An alternative to A-levels: seven things you should know about the International Baccalaureate Diploma</head>
    <body>Thousands of students in more than 5,000 schools all over the world work towards International Baccalaureate (IB) qualifications every year, pursuing a globally focused pathway of study that focuses on equipping them with key skills for the future. While the IB offers a variety of programmes for pupils aged from three to 19, it’s best known for its two-year International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) – for students aged 16 to 19. Here’s everything you need to know about the IBDP. It’s academically challenging and rewarding The diploma programme includes a theory of knowledge component, which develops critical thinking; an extended essay – a 4,000-word paper based on self-directed research and study on a topic of personal interest; and a project that relates to the concepts of creativity, activity and service. “You have to have achieved reasonably well in your previous qualifications to be accepted, so we look at students’ grades to make sure they’re academically suited to the programme. There’s no point putting kids on a course they might struggle with. The IBDP also requires more contact time and work than A-levels,” says Alessandro Capozzi, head of sixth form at King’s InterHigh. It’s an alternative to A-levels The IBDP is a curriculum option for sixth form-age students, and the international equivalent to A-levels. A key difference between the two qualifications is the breadth of subjects students continue to study in the IBDP – they take English, another language, mathematics, a science subject, a humanities subject and a sixth subject of their choice. Students will then select some of these to pursue at a higher level. The diploma programme also focuses on helping students develop academic skills, while teaching them to think critically and independently, and to become well-rounded individuals. Broad career choices The IBDP opens the door to many different career options. Having followed the International Baccalaureate curriculum throughout her school life, Micol Bosso, 16, began studying the IBDP last September at King’s InterHigh – an online school – from her home in London. It’s a programme that aligns with her academic and career goals. “I’m studying business management, economics and English at a higher level because I’m interested in a career in international management and economics,” she says. “I’m also interested in studying English and modern languages, so I’m doing higher-level Spanish as well. It’s hard work, but it’s the right programme for me. When it comes to [applying to] university, I will have more options.” You can study online Although the vast majority of IBDP students attend a physical school, the programme is also taught online. King’s InterHigh was the world’s first school to offer the IB Diploma Programme entirely online. One of the biggest benefits of online study is the increased accessibility, says Capozzi. “It’s a flexible option with lesson recordings, resources, and a school that moves with you. It’s a way of learning that fits around our students’ lives, rather than the other way around.” Join the global classroom community The current IBDP cohort at King’s InterHigh is incredibly global, hailing from countries such as India, Antigua, Botswana, Madagascar, Norway, Italy, France, Turkey and the UK. Students study together in virtual classrooms, collaborating on projects, learning from each other and developing key future skills. “We have incorporated teaching and learning technologies to improve delivery and increase understanding and immersion in topics, for example, using VR,” says Capozzi. A global and diverse community is a key feature of the diploma. Built into the fabric of the course is the desire to work with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Being part of a global community and working alongside students from different countries and cultures has helped to enhance Bosso’s studies. “I’m studying environmental science, so it’s important for me to understand what’s happening in different countries and cultures,” says Bosso. “Working in such a diverse group gives you that insight and opens your mind to different ways of doing things.” IB students are highly sought after The IBDP is held in high regard by universities all over the world, as IB students are seen to possess the breadth of skills, resilience and international-mindedness to thrive at university. Many universities offer scholarships to IB students. Imperial College London, for instance, is offering 28 scholarships to IBDP holders, each worth £3,000 per year, across its engineering, natural sciences and business school faculties. Other universities operate a sliding scale, with scholarships based on the number of IBDP points students have achieved. The American University of Paris, for example, awards scholarships of €14,000 (£12,350) per year, almost 40% of full-time tuition, for those who achieve a score of 36 to 39, €20,000 (£16,000) per year, almost 60% of full-time tuition, for those who achieve a score of 40 to 43, and 100% full tuition scholarships for students who achieve a score of 44 or 45 – the highest possible score for an IBDP. Related: Smaller classes and global friendships: studying online for the International Baccalaureate Diploma It isn’t all work and no play The IBDP is a rigorous programme of study that demands high levels of commitment and self-discipline. However, it also focuses on emotional and social development by encouraging students to take part in extracurricular activities, ranging from computer programming and oil painting to gardening and yoga, plus community-focused activities. As well as providing respite from their studies, a broad social agenda allows students to develop other important skills such as empathy, teamwork and organisation. “The IB helps students develop a broad range of transferable skills that will help them with both their university education and throughout their lives,” says Capozzi. “These children are exploring themselves, ethically, socially and culturally, they have amazing global connectivity, and they are loving it. They are the leaders of tomorrow.” King’s InterHigh is now enrolling for its fully online IB Diploma Programme for September 2023.

    <head>First Thing: FBI accused of failures but report finds no deep-state plot against Trump</head>
    <body>Good morning. Special counsel John Durham found no evidence that the US justice department and the FBI conspired in a deep-state plot to investigate Donald Trump’s ties to Russia in 2016, though the report released on Monday found that the FBI’s handling of key aspects of the case were deficient. The Durham report was sharply critical of how the FBI decided to open the counterintelligence investigation into Trump, known as “Crossfire Hurricane”, accusing top officials at the bureau of relying on raw and uncorroborated information to continue the inquiry. Much of the criticism of the FBI in the roughly 300-page report was already known when the justice department inspector general issued its own report, which raised similar concerns but ultimately concluded that the FBI investigation into Trump was justified. The Durham report was more scathing, finding that the FBI moved quickly on a vague tip about potential contacts between a Trump campaign aide and Russian officials in July 2016 based on “raw, unanalyzed and uncorroborated evidence” in a “departure from how it approached” the Clinton campaign. What do we know about the Durham investigation of an investigation? In May 2019, the then US attorney general in the Trump administration, William Barr, asked federal prosecutor John Durham, the US attorney in Connecticut, to investigate an investigation: the one carried out into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and links between Donald Trump and Moscow. Here’s what else we know. Ukraine: Russia targets Kyiv with massive overnight airstrike A firefighter tries to put out fire caused by fragments of a Russian rocket after it was shot down by air defense system during the night Russian rocket attack in Kyiv, Ukraine. Photograph: AP Ukraine was assessing the damage after Russian forces carried out a massive strike of “exceptional intensity” on Kyiv overnight, in one of the biggest attacks on the capital since last year’s invasion. Emergency sirens woke residents at 2.30am local time and soon afterwards there were loud booms as Ukrainian air defences engaged incoming missiles. Tracer fire lit up the sky and car alarms went off. There were explosions. A further air raid warning sounded at 4am. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Kyiv’s defenders had shot down 18 out of 18 Russian rockets and drones. The city had came under an intense and sweeping attack from the “north, south and east”, featuring missiles fired from air, sea and land, he said. Air defence batteries successfully intercepted six hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, the most potent long-range weapon in the Kremlin’s arsenal. They also downed nine cruise missiles, three ballistic missiles, six kamikaze drones and three unmanned aerial vehicles, Ukraine’s military high command said. Was anyone killed? After a sleepless night in which many locals sought refuge in bomb shelters, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, gave an update on damage. He said there were three victims in the Solomyan district, which was hit by falling rocket debris. Rescuers extinguished blazes after vehicles caught fire. New Mexico shooting leaves three people dead and nine injured Police investigate the scene of a shooting in Farmington, New Mexico, on 15 May. Photograph: Susan Montoya Bryan/AP At least three people have been killed and multiple people injured after a shooting in Farmington, New Mexico, where police killed the suspected 18-year-old gunman, authorities said yesterday. The incident occurred at about 11am in Farmington, a city of about 50,000 people in the north-west of the state adjacent to the Navajo Nation. Officers responding to several calls about a shooting found “a chaotic scene” where a man was firing at people on a residential street, said Baric Crum, the Farmington police deputy chief, during a news conference. Police confronted the suspect before fatally shooting him. They found three people dead. Crum did not identify the suspect and said he did not know the ages of any of the victims. “Besides the suspect himself, who is deceased, there were nine other people injured,” Crum said, adding that police were trying to determine why he was in the neighborhood. Some of the incident was captured in footage posted on TikTok, which a police department spokesperson confirmed was authentic. What did the TikTok video show? It shows a man dressed in black pacing around a driveway outside the First Church of Christ, Scientist, carrying what appears to be a handgun, before he is later seen being shot by police in front of the building.

Thousands of tons of timber from Myanmar have continued to be imported into the US, despite government sanctions against the country’s state-run timber company, a report from a watchdog environmental advocacy group has revealed. The UN’s labour rights watchdog, the International Labour Organization (ILO), is facing a backlash over the nomination of Qatar to chair its flagship annual conference despite a police investigation into alleged bribery of EU lawmakers by the Gulf state. Police in Virginia have named the suspect in an attack in which two staffers at the district office of a Democratic congressman were assaulted with a metal baseball bat and required hospital treatment. Xuan Kha Tran Pham, 49, was arrested after the attack and faces charges of malicious wounding and aggravated malicious wounding. Books about the Tiananmen Square massacre, Hong Kong protest movements, and other subjects deemed politically sensitive by Beijing have been removed from Hong Kong’s public libraries in the lead-up to the 34th anniversary of the killings. Stat of the day: Mormon church has $100bn ‘clandestine hedge fund’, says whistleblower Some experts say it is unlikely that the LDS church will face more scrutiny because the organization is so politically powerful. Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP A former investment manager for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says that the organization stockpiled more than $100bn in funding intended for charity work but never spent it on such projects. “It was really a clandestine hedge fund,” David A Nielsen said during an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes. “Once the money went in, it didn’t go out.” Nielsen, who submitted a complaint to the Internal Revenue Service in 2019, previously managed the church’s investment arm, Ensign Peak Advisors, for nine years. A report on the complaint to the top US tax authority was published by the Washington Post in 2019 after Nielsen’s brother provided a copy. Nielsen, a devout Mormon himself, was first recruited to work for Ensign Peak while working on Wall Street.

Photograph: Slaven Vlašić/Getty Images Still weeks away from taking up the role of Twitter’s new chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, a respected media veteran known in advertising circles as the “Velvet Hammer” for her silky but tough negotiating style, has already had a taste of the shambolic corporate environment that has swept the platform since Elon Musk bought it for $44bn last October. Hours after teasing in a post that he had appointed a new chief executive, a role he had described as a “painful” job that anyone would be “foolish” to take on, Musk confirmed speculation that Yaccarino had accepted the challenge. Prior to Musk’s announcement, she had been rehearsing to lead the company’s annual pitch to advertisers on Monday in the biggest event of the year for the business. She has been praised for understanding of advertisers – but will Musk cede enough control for her to do the job well? Climate check: punishing heatwave grips Pacific north-west as wildfires rage in western Canada A child plays in a fountain to cool off in downtown Portland, Oregon, on Friday 12 May 2023. Photograph: Claire Rush/AP A punishing heatwave will continue to cook the Pacific north-west this week, after millions of people endured a weekend of temperatures that pushed past 90F (32C) and broke early spring records in several cities. The hot, dry weather is fuelling dozens of wildfires across western Canada, where thousands have been evacuated and more than a million acres have already burned. Temperatures are dropping but forecasters with the National Weather Service warned yesterday that they would remain “20-30 degrees above average in the Pacific north-west throughout this week”. Climate models show the region continues to warm in the coming years, posing new dangers to residents and ecosystems alike. Fuelled by the climate crisis, dangerous heatwaves that last longer and cover more ground are becoming more likely.

    <head>UK government urged to act as some meat and veg prices double in a year</head>
    <body>Some meat and vegetable lines at supermarkets have almost doubled in price over the past year, research has found, prompting fresh calls for the government to intervene as food industry figures gather for summit in Downing Street. Annual inflation on supermarket own-label budget items stepped up to 25% in April, according to the data from consumer group Which?, while the rate of price increases on branded goods remained steady at just under 14%. However, some individual items rose at a far faster pace. The price of a pack of Morliny frankfurters at Asda shot up from an average of £1.25 to £2.42, an increase of nearly 94% in a year, while a four-pack of brown onions at Morrisons went from 65p to £1.24 – a 91% rise. Related: Supermarket bosses face grilling on fuel prices from watchdog The highest rate of inflation by category last month was on cheese and milk – both over 20% – while inflation eased slightly on both premium and regular supermarket own-brand items. Sue Davies, the head of food policy at Which?, urged Rishi Sunak to ask grocery bosses gathering at No 10 on Tuesday to commit to doing more to hold prices down, “including stocking budget lines in convenience stores to ensure easy access to basic, affordable food ranges that support a healthy diet”. The call comes after supermarkets in France agreed to cap prices on key food stuffs and the government gave support to producers amid hefty inflation over the Channel. Supermarkets, farmers and food industry leaders are meeting the prime minister to discuss how to tackle food price inflation, which rose to 19% in March, according to official government figures. Before the summit, agriculture and food lobby groups called for more access to overseas workers to help pick crops and better regulation of suppliers’ relations with supermarkets as well as help to adapt to cope with an anticipated rise in extreme weather conditions prompted by climate change. The UK’s competition watchdog announced on Monday that it would look at whether a poorly functioning market was contributing to food price inflation, alongside a similar investigation into fuel prices. Anna Taylor of the sustainable food lobby group the Food Foundation called on the government to reinstate its horticulture strategy, which was abandoned earlier this month, in order to secure supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables from the UK, as farmers both here and overseas face difficulties in growing crops in increasingly volatile conditions. She also said the government should expand the Healthy Start voucher scheme, which ensured that low-income households could afford fresh produce. “Climate shocks are going to be worsening as we go into the future, and we should be expecting food price inflation to be normal state of affairs. We need to be thinking seriously about how we cope with inflation better than we are now,” Taylor said. Vicki Hird, head of farming at the Sustain alliance of farming, environmental and community groups, said the government was “failing to support farmers properly” amid a crisis in horticultural production caused by rising costs and lack of labour availability. She said the government should extend the powers of the independent Groceries Code Adjudicator so that rules such as no automatic delisting of suppliers’ products could be legally enforced. Fears about the UK’s food supplies have increased after supermarkets were forced to ration supplies of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers in February owing to extreme weather interrupting supplies of salad and vegetable crops from southern Spain and north Africa. UK supplies of salad crops have also been restricted by a cold, grey spring and a rise in the cost of energy that has prompted greenhouse growers to cut back on production. Despite problems with supplies, the government ditched plans for a horticulture strategy, one the few recommendations it had agreed to take forward from a government-commissioned report by the founder of Leon restaurants, Henry Dimbleby. Fears have arisen that large companies have used the cover of inflation to boost profits, with those on lowest income suffering the most.</body>

    <head>Cop28 host UAE’s approach is ‘dangerous’, says UN’s ex-climate chief</head>
    <body>The United Arab Emirates’ approach to the Cop28 climate summit it will preside over in November is “very dangerous” and a “direct threat to the survival of vulnerable nations”, according to the UN’s former climate chief. Christiana Figueres, who was pivotal to the delivery of the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015, also said the country holding the presidency of the UN summit could not put forward its own position and had to be neutral. The UAE is a big oil and gas producer, and the designated president of the Cop28 summit is Sultan Al Jaber, who is also the head of the UAE’s national oil and gas company, Adnoc. Figueres was responding to a speech by Al Jaber in which he said: “We must be laser focused on phasing out fossil fuel emissions, while phasing up viable, affordable zero carbon alternatives.” That was widely interpreted to mean using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to capture CO2 emissions, and not completely phasing out fossil fuels themselves. “The fact that ‘emissions’ is in that sentence is very worrisome,” said Figueres, on the Outrage and Optimism podcast she co-hosts. “So he is trying to dance on two dancefloors at the same time. He is trying to say: ‘Look, those of us who are producers of fossil fuels will be responsible for our emissions through enhanced carbon capture and storage. And we, or the Cop presidency, will also support the zero carbon alternatives.’” “The fact that he thinks the [fossil fuel] energy used today will continue to be part of the global energy mix for the ‘foreseeable future’, I can see that from a UAE perspective,” Figueres said, adding that foreseeable is a “long time”. “But from a Cop president perspective, it’s very dangerous. I just don’t see most countries, and certainly not the vulnerable countries, being willing to support the Cop president on this because it is a direct threat to their survival.” “When you are the president of the Cop, you cannot put forward the position of the country that you’re coming from. You have to be able to be neutral.” The world must slash CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 to have a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C. Figueres said: “We do not have CCS commercially available and viable over the next five to seven years. It’s just not going to happen. We have an issue of timing here, in addition to a moral issue.” The appointment of Al Jaber as Cop28 president in January attracted significant criticism. The Guardian revealed in April that the UAE has the third biggest net zero-busting plans in the world for oil and gas expansion, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Scientists are agreed that most fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground to meet the climate objectives of the Paris agreement, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) saying that new fossil fuel projects begun after 2021 are not compatible with reaching net zero emissions by 2050. A Cop28 spokesperson said Al Jaber was “committed to lead an impartial process that gives space for all [countries] to express their views and find common ground”. He said it was a “misunderstanding” to think the phrase “phasing out fossil fuel emissions” referred only to CCS, noting Al Jaber’s call to triple renewable energy capacity and double hydrogen production by 2030 while using CCS to decarbonise heavy emitting industries, where other options were not viable. “The focus on ending fossil fuel emissions responds to the immediate needs of decarbonisation in a pragmatic, practical and realistic way, especially given that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and IEA predict that fossil fuels will play a role in the energy mix through 2050 within a 1.5C aligned pathway” the Cop28 spokesperson said. “That’s why [Al Jaber] has also called on the oil and gas industry to up its game, zero out methane emissions by 2030 and align around net zero by 2050.” The IEA’s head, Fatih Birol, said on Saturday: “Many were hit hard by soaring energy prices in 2022. But for the oil and gas industry, it was a year of record profits. It’s now time to put that to use for wider benefit.” He said emissions from oil and gas industry operations produced 15% of global emissions but these could be cut by 60% by 2030 with investment of $600bn. “[That is] much less than the trillions of dollars the industry accrued last year,” Birol said. “This is a moment of truth: if the oil and gas industry wants to be taken seriously in climate discussions, it has to clean up its act. Hosted by a major oil and gas producer, Cop28 in the UAE is a unique opportunity [for the industry] to demonstrate a real commitment to cutting emissions.” Figueres also heavily criticised the global fossil fuel industry and its “shocking” profits on a second recent podcast. She said: “What astonishes me is that the oil and gas industry makes apparently no effort to get on the right side of history. They’re just flaunting their profits in front of everyone without any sensitivity to the impact of that.” “These unprecedented profits are not being put to the use of humanity. They are being put to the use of the industry and its shareholders – a very tiny little portion of humanity. I am actually outraged that that is the choice that they have been making.” The oil and gas industry has made an average of $1tn a year in pure profit for the past 50 years.</body>

    <head>Man charged as pregnant woman dies in motorway crash</head>
    <body>A pregnant woman has died after a motorway crash that also left her son and nephew badly hurt. Frankie Jules-Hough, 38, was fatally injured at about 3.10pm on Saturday on the M66 in Bury, Greater Manchester. Her son Tommy, nine; Tobias Spencer, four, who is believed to be her nephew; and her other son, Rocky, two, were also hurt. Adil Iqbal, 22, from Accrington, Lancashire, who was allegedly driving a BMW, has appeared in court charged with causing the death by dangerous driving of Jules-Hough, along with the two other charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, relating to the two boys. When Iqbal appeared at Manchester magistrates court on Monday, lawyers confirmed that Jules-Hough had died. At the brief court hearing, Robin Lynch, prosecuting, gave details of the incident, saying Jules-Hough was driving a car carrying three children. He added: “The driver is now deceased.” Iqbal, wearing a grey tracksuit, spoke only to confirm his name and address, and looked over to his father, uncle and younger brother sitting in the public gallery of the court. District Judge James Hatton remanded Iqbal in custody to appear at Minshull Street crown court in Manchester on 19 June. A GoFundMe appeal for the family of Jules-Hough set up by a friend said she was 18-weeks pregnant expecting a daughter. The appeal said Tommy and Tobias were in induced comas in intensive care in hospital. The family of Jules-Hough paid tribute to her on Facebook. Sherrie Jean-Louise said: “There are no words for how I feel right now. Life can be horribly cruel – a beautiful soul, friend, sister, daughter, Mamma &amp; Mamma-to-be taken way too soon and in the most tragic way! I’m heartbroken and filled with so many ‘ifs and buts’.” Rebecca Adimora wrote: “I can’t believe this. Franki you will be sorely missed by so many. We love you infinitely earth angel, fly high, this realm may just not have been destined for your loving soul and your unborn angel, you will shine beyond this my love.”</body>

    <head>Chelsea women sign midfielder Sjoeke Nüsken from Eintracht Frankfurt</head>
    <body>Chelsea have announced the signing of the Germany midfielder Sjoeke Nüsken, who will join from Eintracht Frankfurt on 1 July. The 22-year-old, who has a three-year deal, can also play at centre-half. “Sjoeke is a fantastic young midfield player whose ability to play the ball deep into the opponents’ half is not her only standout strength,” Chelsea’s manager, Emma Hayes, said. “There is everything from her interceptions, her reading of the game and her overall presence. She’s dynamic, she’s good aerially and she’s going to be a fantastic signing.” Nüsken has 15 caps and two goals after also playing for Germany at a number of age-group levels. She made 92 appearances for Frankfurt across four years, scoring 13 goals. Two compatriots, the goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger and midfielder Melanie Leupolz, are at Chelsea. “English football is very cool to play in and it’s the right thing to do now,” Nüsken said. “I’m very excited and happy to be at Chelsea.” Chelsea won a third successive Women’s FA Cup on Sunday and return to WSL action on Wednesday. A win at West Ham would take them top, two points clear of Manchester United, with two matches to play.</body>

    <head>UK interest rate rises are taking the labour market off the boil</head>
    <body>There are signs the Bank of England’s interest rate rises are making businesses think twice about hiring staff, bringing down the number of vacancies. Pushing in the same direction, the high cost of living is driving more people back into the workforce. The effect shows up in the latest labour figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as a fall of 55,000 in the number of vacancies in the three months to April and a 156,000 drop in the number of inactive workers. Related: UK payroll numbers fall as unemployment rate rises to 3.9% Separate HMRC figures showed a 136,000 fall in PAYE employees between March and April – the first reduction since February 2021. Put together, these figures tell us the UK’s pressure-cooker labour market – with lots of advertised jobs and too few workers to fill them – has begun to come off the boil. When the Bank of England’s main concern relates to the tightness of the labour market, which is reflected in a high vacancy rate, then these trends will be welcomed by anyone who wants interest rates to fall and growth to pick up. Interactive Businesses welcomed the fall in vacancies, even though the trend is partly due to firms going out of businesses or being too worried to hire new staff. What they haven’t welcomed is the continuing mismatch between the skills they need and the people looking for work. Interactive The British Chambers of Commerce head of people policy, Jane Gratton, made this issue the main focus of her comments. “Skills shortages and unfilled job vacancies are the stark reality for many businesses across all sectors and regions,” she said. “We still have more than a million job vacancies which are damaging the economy by preventing firms from fulfilling order books and taking on new work.” Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, added: “There are still 282 thousand more vacancies in the UK than before the pandemic. Government policy needs to work harder to ensure that our education and training system is providing the types of skills that employers are looking for.” These complaints are not going to be resolved quickly. And they are not going to be resolved at all if the government refuses to pump more resources into skills training. The ONS said its surveys found that people of all ages were returning to the labour market who had previously said they were caring for relatives or retired, though the biggest number of returners were job-hunting students. Another month of falling wages relative to inflation – the 16th consecutive fall in real pay using the ONS’s three-month average – has also forced many people already in employment to take a second or third job. The health system is also the focus of attention after a steep rise in the number of people off work with a long-term illness hit a record 2.55 million people. Ben Harrison, the director of the Work Foundation thinktank at Lancaster University, said the number of people opting out of work on the grounds of ill health “suggests a radically different approach is needed to boost the UK workforce”. The TUC suggested the government’s mission to make work more insecure and promote a hire and fire culture had backfired. One of the largest increases in ill-health was among those off work with a mental health issue. They are telling employers, to adapt one of the playwright Dario Fo’s famous phrases, they “can’t work, won’t work”. Circumstances are not the same in continental Europe. The activity rate in France, Germany and even Italy is higher than it was before the pandemic. In Britain, it is lower with more than 400,000 fewer workers than in 2019. And there is no sign of anything more than modest, incremental improvements in the months ahead, which could force the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher for longer.</body>

    <head>British men making thousands by posing as fathers in citizenship scam, reports say</head>
    <body>British men are taking payments of up to £10,000 to add their names to the birth certificates of migrant women’s children, according to reports. A BBC Newsnight investigation has found scammers are using Facebook to find willing participants and claim to have “helped” thousands of women with the move, which helps the child to get UK citizenship and the mother a residency route. Facebook told the BBC such content was banned by its rules. A BBC researcher went undercover, posing as a pregnant woman who was in the UK illegally, and spoke to people offering the services. One agent, who went by the name Thai, told her he had a number of British men who could act as fake fathers and offered a “full package” for £11,000. He introduced the undercover researcher to a British man called Andrew, who he said would pose as a father and would be paid £8,000 from the total fee, the BBC reports. A child is automatically British by birth if a migrant woman is in the UK illegally but gives birth to a child fathered by a British citizen or a man with indefinite leave to remain. The mother can then apply for a family visa, which will give her the right to remain in the UK and apply for citizenship in due course. Last year, 4,860 family visas were granted to “other dependants”, a category that includes those applying to stay in the UK as parents of British children. Deliberately giving false details on a birth certificate is a criminal offence. The Home Office told the BBC it had measures in place to prevent and detect immigration fraud using false birth certificates. The BBC was told that the practice occurred in many different migrant communities including those from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, and had been happening for many years. The investigation found that the illegal practice was advertised widely on some Vietnamese Facebook groups for jobseekers. Meta, the company that owns Facebook, told the BBC it did not allow “the solicitation of adoptions or birth certificate fraud on Facebook”. It said it would continue to remove content that violated its policies.</body>

    <head>Noise, pollution, danger: how Amazon warehouses upended a sleepy New York neighborhood</head>
    <body>On a drizzly Friday night, Rosana Zapata was mapping out a changing neighborhood. Using Sharpie and pencil, the 18-year-old sketched her world on printer paper: a street intersection, a small parking lot, a lit-up sign for fried chicken. “I have a lot of memories there,” Zapata told a small group of young artists seated at school desks, who had each drawn their own favorite neighborhood spots. These treasured locations stand against an increasingly difficult-to-ignore backdrop: truck traffic, driven partly by an e-commerce boom. In the last decade, Red Hook – a Brooklyn neighborhood whose waterfront faces the upper New York harbor – has undergone cataclysmic flooding from Hurricane Sandy as well as years of construction in the neighborhood’s large public housing complex, the Red Hook Houses. Now, residents face a sudden buildup of last-mile warehouse facilities. Since late 2021, Amazon has opened two facilities in the neighborhood, and it’s set to open a third later this year. Together, the three structures will comprise more than 800,000 sq feet of warehousing space and parking, with one facility’s 90ft walls casting shadows across a community garden. Each new operation sends more vehicles down Red Hook’s narrow streets. Zapata worries about the increase of trucks and vans, especially when they roll by the school her younger brother attends. “That’s very dangerous,” she said. “Kids play around; kids are gonna be kids. We don’t want anyone to get hurt.” And she has noticed an uptick in traffic at the intersection she drew – where Wolcott and Dwight streets meet, right by the public library. Rosana Zapata at Coffey Park in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Photograph: Amir Hamja/The Guardian “Red Hook can be like a second family – even a first family,” she said. “But this community is changing a lot. It’s very, very hectic – it’s just too much sometimes.” Residents worry that the warehouses threaten the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, and the health of their neighbors – but a lack of data has made it harder to advocate for more local control over warehouse openings. (Federal, state and local governments don’t regularly collect information on air quality or traffic when e-commerce facilities open, the way they often monitor other industrial sites like power plants or factories.) Related: Are Amazon delivery hubs making neighborhoods less healthy and more dangerous? Red Hook residents have now taken matters into their own hands. In a first-ever collaboration, members of the community installed traffic, air-quality and sound sensors purchased by Consumer Reports, and are now gathering data throughout the neighborhood. Consumer Reports teamed up with the Guardian to analyze the first several months of data. Our measurements do not show precisely how much the new facilities have affected Red Hook, since the sensors were installed after they opened. However, seven months of initial data shows a neighborhood under stress: A traffic sensor on Red Hook’s main street counts nearly 1,000 trucks and vans on an average weekday. The street is lined with shops and restaurants, and regularly gets backed up with semis and double-parked vans. An air-quality sensor next to the Red Hook Houses, the neighborhood’s large public housing complex, measured 16 days in the last seven months with levels of particulate pollution the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says can be harmful for sensitive groups such as people with asthma. Red Hook has disproportionately high asthma rates. A sound meter charts noises that are twice as loud as background levels every three minutes during daytime hours, and four times as loud every 30 minutes, on average. More warehouses are on their way to Red Hook. Several planned facilities, including one that is larger than a million square feet, could bring more than 1,300 additional trucks to the neighborhood every weekday. This problem could get much worse. As the new facilities begin operating, the sensors should help residents document the increasing environmental impacts. But neighborhood groups are already preparing to deploy the data to advocate for new rules on how e-commerce facilities are developed throughout the city and state. Thousands of trucks and vans On Van Brunt Street, a narrow two-lane street lined with parked cars, shops and restaurants, trucks and vans make their presence known daily. “It seems to operate like clockwork,” said Scott Pfaffman, an artist who owns the building that houses the Record Shop, a vinyl store on Van Brunt that is a part of the sensor network. On the store’s roof sits a vehicle counter, while a sound meter roosts in a tree out front. A pair of laser sensors suspended over the shop’s door chart air pollution from trucks and other sources that can damage respiratory health, especially among children and elderly people. On an average weekday, the traffic sensor at the store counts 61 trucks and vans an hour in the period between 10am and noon, or about one each minute. The vehicle counter can tell the difference between a car and a van, a cyclist and a pedestrian – but it can’t visually identify which vans are branded with Amazon, FedEx or other delivery logos. Still, stand outside the store, and it’s clear that many of the vans in the morning rush are Amazon vehicles; they rumble up Van Brunt Street in packs of a dozen or more. Sometimes, residents stop on the sidewalk to record videos of the long lines of Amazon vans. A second sensor – placed atop an upholstery store a half mile away – found even higher rates of truck and van traffic. This sensor typically sees about 105 trucks and vans an hour pass by between 10am and noon. On particularly busy days, it can be more than 140 trucks an hour. Interactive [Read more about our methodology below.] On several occasions, this sensor counted more than 1,200 trucks and vans over the course of a day – and that’s probably an undercount, because the sensors can miss vehicles when it’s dark outside. That’s a high volume of delivery traffic for Van Brunt Street, said Brian Ketcham, who worked as a transportation engineer for New York City before consulting for neighborhood and environmental groups. “For a narrow two-way street with parking, yeah, that’s a lot of trucks and vans,” Ketcham said. Data analyzed by the Guardian and Consumer Reports is in line with general trends across New York City. Delivery traffic in the city is booming, with the number of daily deliveries climbing from 1.8m in 2019 to 2.25m in 2023, according to an estimate from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Locals say a crush of trucks and vans now clog the neighborhood’s streets, jostling for space with buses, cars, pedestrians, bikes and scooters. The trucks and vans that deliver these packages also contribute to disruptive street noise. Every three minutes during the day since Consumer Reports and the Guardian began gathering sound data in January, there’s a sound that’s twice as loud as background noise levels. Amazon trucks leave the Beard Street facility in Red Hook, Brooklyn, on 12 November 2022. Photograph: Amir Hamja/The Guardian Mary Dudine, the owner of a wine and spirits shop on Van Brunt Street, said she’s bothered by the beeping of trucks reversing over and over as they try to make tight right-angle turns. “That noise is there specifically to warn and alarm us,” Dudine said. “If every place I turn, all I hear is something saying ‘Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!’, what am I supposed to do? It’s just everywhere.” Dudine said she can hear large semis hitting potholes two blocks away from her shop. Passing trucks regularly rattle the bottles on her shelves. When warehouses open in a residential neighborhood, the increase in the number of vehicles on the streets sends ripple effects throughout the community. “It’s a real problem putting warehouses into residential communities,” said Ketcham. “It breaks up the roads faster. Noise is higher. It slows down traffic for passenger cars.” More distribution centers are on the way, threatening to bring over a thousand more delivery trucks to Red Hook every weekday. Amazon’s third Red Hook warehouse will add an estimated 344 truck trips and 1,224 car trips every weekday, according to a 2020 traffic study commissioned by the company that built the warehouse. This warehouse is scheduled to open in September, according to officials at a neighboring school who spoke to Amazon. Amazon spokesperson Simone Griffin would not confirm a timeline to Consumer Reports and the Guardian but said the facility “remains in our plans”. In a statement, Griffin said: “We always work hard to be a good neighbor, and take into account what it might mean for a community if we locate a building there,” but added that the company is aware of traffic issues and works with the community and local policymakers on such issues “when it makes sense to do so”. Just a few blocks away, another proposed waterfront logistics complex includes an 80ft-tall warehouse, already under construction, and another 200ft-tall warehouse. It’s not yet clear who will operate them; developers will lease out the facilities once construction is completed. This compound and the Amazon warehouse due to open later this year together could generate more than 1,350 additional truck trips every weekday, according to the same formula used in the traffic study cited above. Worse air quality, greater health risk Air pollution in Red Hook regularly rises to levels the EPA categorizes as concerning for people who are particularly sensitive to particulate pollution, according to air-quality monitors set up by community members working with Consumer Reports and the Guardian. Between September 2022 and April 2023, an air-quality monitor on residential Lorraine Street right across from the Red Hook Houses measured 16 days with particulate pollution levels above the level the EPA considers potentially harmful for sensitive groups. At the upholstery store and the Record Shop – which is located across the street from a public school playground – sensors each counted 14 days with potentially harmful pollution levels. Although the sensors can’t draw a direct connection between delivery traffic and elevated pollution, these particulate levels will only worsen if truck and van traffic increases. A sensor near the Red Hook Houses measures particulate pollution. Photograph: Amir Hamja/The Guardian Amazon and other last-mile warehouses in Red Hook are opening shop against a backdrop of environmental hazards and concerning health outcomes. “This neighborhood already has toxic parts that have impacted health over the past few decades,” said Tevina Willis, community organizing manager at Red Hook Initiative, a longtime neighborhood non-profit. For example, the city closed a large park complex next to the Red Hook Houses in 2015 because the EPA found dangerous contaminants such as lead in the soil. Half of the 16 fields in the complex are still closed today. In the two census tracts that contain 80% of Red Hook’s residents, asthma-related emergency room visits were higher than the average rate for Brooklyn and New York City, according to a 2018 report from Red Hook Initiative. And the 11231 zip code containing Red Hook has higher levels of asthma-related emergency room visits than any of the surrounding zip codes, according to data from the New York state department of health gathered between 2018 and 2020. (This is the most recent data available.) “To put more things in here that are going to impact that – that’s what has residents concerned,” Willis said. Interactive Increasing delivery traffic will only add to the pollution burden in Red Hook. Microscopic particles from heavy vehicle emissions can settle deep in a person’s lungs, elevating their risk of asthma, heart disease, cancer, late-onset depression and dementia. Elderly people, children and people with existing respiratory conditions are particularly vulnerable. And the burden of that pollution isn’t evenly distributed, according to a study from True Initiative, a British emissions-focused research group. On average, people of color in New York are exposed to 15% more particulate emissions than white residents. Despite these large exposure gaps, there’s a worrying lack of hyperlocal air quality data across the US, experts say. Citizen science efforts – in which residents monitor air, water and other conditions themselves – can help close the gap. “Some of our most polluted communities in the US are severely under-monitored by traditional air-quality monitoring efforts,” said Dan Westervelt, a scientist at Columbia University studying air pollution. “Neighborhood-scale data leveraging consumer-grade air sensors is critical for addressing latent air-quality challenges.” Red Hook, for example, is a blind spot in New York City: none of the roughly 100 sensors in the city-run community air survey program are in the neighborhood. “What the city is collecting is inadequate,” Alexa Avilés, the New York city councilmember whose district includes Red Hook, told Consumer Reports and the Guardian. “And so community members and civic groups have decided to take that into their own hands.” She said the city needed to pick up the slack – but e-commerce companies like Amazon should be partly responsible for monitoring air quality near their facilities, too. An Amazon last-mile facility seen from the rooftop of the Basis school in Red Hook. Photograph: Amir Hamja/The Guardian To cut down on emissions, Amazon says it plans to deploy 100,000 electric delivery vans nationwide by 2030. As of now, more than 3,000 of them are on the road, Amazon tells Consumer Reports, but none of them are in Red Hook. Amazon isn’t the only delivery giant moving toward electric vehicles. FedEx, which is building a large last-mile facility right next door to Red Hook in Sunset Park, says its entire delivery fleet will be electric by 2040. UPS – which in 2018 bought and later razed a huge waterfront parcel in Red Hook that has remained empty ever since – has not publicly set a target date for converting its entire delivery fleet to zero-emissions vehicles, but it has committed to buying 10,000 electric vehicles. Electrifying delivery vans will cut down on a large part of particulate emissions, but it won’t eliminate them. Electric vehicles still generate non-exhaust particulate pollution such as brake, tire and road dust – especially heavier delivery vans. For this reason and other safety concerns, city advocates and officials are pushing for alternatives that would decrease the number of trucks and vans on the road altogether, such as cargo bikes. In a small pilot program, Amazon is now making some Red Hook-area deliveries by cargo bike. Elsewhere in the city, UPS, FedEx, DHL and two other logistics companies also make deliveries by bike. Air quality near a new breed of warehouse Zapata is one of the tens of thousands of Brooklynites living with asthma. “I know many people with asthma also,” she said. “I don’t want to be breathing in air that could possibly give me diseases or affect my body. And I don’t want the kids to have any issues or have asthma because of the trucks.” Zapata is part of the Red Hook Art Project, in which she and a small cohort of young adults are leading workshops designed to get neighbors thinking about what’s changing in Red Hook, and how they might respond. They’re now using sensor data to prepare for conversations with city and state representatives. Several organizations are gathering similar data in Red Hook, including the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative, which has installed several traffic-counting sensors. A partnership between the City University of New York and the local non-profits Red Hook Initiative and Pioneer Works has installed several air-quality monitors. In Red Hook, two-thirds of the land is zoned for manufacturing, allowing last-mile facilities to pop up unchecked. In these areas, warehouse developers don’t have to ask New York City for permission or solicit input from neighbors before building – they don’t generally need to do traffic studies, or get special applications. Rosana Zapata walks through Red Hook on a recent morning. Zapata is one of the tens of thousands of Brooklynites living with asthma. Photograph: Amir Hamja/The Guardian These zoning rules date back to 1961, a time when a warehouse typically meant a moderate-sized building where goods would be stored for extended periods, generating little traffic. City officials and local advocates are pushing to change this rule, because it lumps together warehouses used for long-term storage with vast complexes that create round-the-clock delivery traffic. They argue that this new breed of facility should be treated much differently from the old, and should require buy-in from neighbors before moving in. In February, Councilmember Avilés and other city officials promoted a package of eight city proposals and a state bill aimed at curbing harms from last-mile facilities. The proposals would, among other things, require warehouse operators in the city to get a special permit before opening up shop, and submit estimates of how the facilities will affect traffic and air quality. The proposals would also redraw the city’s network of truck routes. Some New York state officials have announced support for reforms to zoning laws. In January, the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, wrote a letter warning the city that its policy to allow warehouses to be built without review or permit could potentially violate federal civil rights law, because it’s allowing last-mile facilities to cluster in neighborhoods of color. The letter cited coverage from Consumer Reports and the Guardian on Red Hook’s warehouse crunch, and urged the city to require warehouse operators to apply for special permits. View of Amazon-acquired land for warehouses from the Louis Valentino Jr pier in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Photograph: Amir Hamja/The Guardian The uneven distribution of delivery facilities is a nationwide problem, as our previous reporting reveals. In 2021, Consumer Reports and the Guardian found that more than two-thirds of Amazon warehouses were in neighborhoods with a disproportionately high number of people of color and that 57% were in disproportionately low-income neighborhoods. Under the Biden administration, the EPA has increased its focus on the disproportionate impact of freight and transportation pollution on communities of color and low-income neighborhoods. It has issued more stringent emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks, and consults with state and local governments on air-quality monitoring. But while some advocacy groups have called on the EPA to hold warehouse operators accountable for pollution resulting from their deliveries, the agency says that’s up to state governments and local agencies. A bill currently in front of the New York state legislature called the Clean Deliveries Act could make New York the first state to do so, if it passes. Sensors sited in three key locations in Red Hook gather several types of data that together help chart the impact of e-commerce delivery traffic: they count trucks and vans, detect particulate pollution and monitor sound levels. The vehicle counts come from camera-based sensors mounted on two rooftops and one volunteer’s balcony. The devices are made by a Brooklyn-based company called Numina, and are designed to detect pedestrians, cyclists and different types of vehicles as they pass through the sensors’ field of view. Consumer Reports purchased the instruments, which take several images a second, use imaging software to categorize the vehicles in the images and then immediately delete the images to preserve the privacy of passersby. We only considered trucks and vans, which Numina counts as a single category. Pollution data comes from a network of three Purple Air monitors. These are inexpensive sensors that use lasers to measure the concentration of PM2.5, which are airborne microscopic particles. Consumer Reports purchased these air-quality monitors, which were installed at the same three locations as the traffic counters. The data from our monitors, plus several others installed by community groups in Red Hook, is publicly available at map.purpleair.com. To improve the accuracy of the monitors, we applied a correction algorithm developed by Dan Westervelt, a Columbia University scientist who uses Purple Air monitors to study traffic pollution in New York City. We converted the air-quality readings from PM2.5 concentration into an easy-to-read air-quality index, or AQI. The Environmental Protection Agency developed the AQI system to help people understand when the air outside is safe to breathe. The sensor we used to chart sound levels was developed by Convergence Instruments, a Canadian firm. The sound monitor picks up loudness in decibels, but doesn’t record or store any audio. Consumer Reports purchased one sound monitor, which is installed at the Record Shop. Consumer Reports and the Guardian worked with Matías Kalwill, an artist and technologist with a studio in Red Hook, to engage with community members to combine and process the data. Kalwill helped develop relationships with sensor hosts and led the installations - which often required custom mounting hardware, electric wiring and wireless data access. He, Juan Chimienti and Juan Manuel Durand, two freelance software developers, built a data pipeline to gather the data streams from the sensors in all three locations, clean them up and apply the necessary corrections, and make them available to Consumer Reports and the Guardian for reporting. Historical air-quality, traffic count and sound level data are available to view on catmap.fm, a website Kalwill, Chimienti and Durand developed for community use.</body>

    <head>EPA finally wakes up with stiff new climate rules: ‘They’ve hit full throttle’</head>
    <body>The sleeping giant of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stirred. In the past month, an avalanche of anti-pollution rules, targeting everything from toxic drinking water to planet-heating gases in the atmosphere, have been issued by the agency. Belatedly, the sizable weight of the US federal government is being thrown at longstanding environmental crises, including the climate emergency. On Thursday, the EPA’s month of frenzied activity was crowned by the toughest ever limits upon carbon pollution from America’s power sector, with large, existing coal and gas plants told they must slash their emissions by 90% or face being shut down. The measure will, the EPA says, wipe out more than 600m tons of carbon emissions over the next two decades, about double what the entire UK emits each year. But even this wasn’t the biggest pollution reduction announced in recent weeks. In April, new emissions standards for cars and trucks will eliminate an expected 9bn tons of CO2 by the mid-point of the century, while separate rules issued late last year aim to slash hydrofluorocarbons, planet-heating gases used widely in refrigeration and air conditioning, by 4.6bn tons in the same timeframe. Methane, another highly potent greenhouse gas, will be curtailed by 810m tons over the next decade in another EPA edict. In just a few short months the EPA, diminished and demoralized under Donald Trump, has flexed its regulatory muscles to the extent that 15bn tons of greenhouse gases – equivalent to about three times the US’s carbon pollution, or nearly half of the entire world’s annual fossil fuel emissions – are set to be prevented, transforming the power basis of Americans’ cars and homes in the process. “They have really hit full throttle. I mean, some of these things have been in train for decades,” said Thomas Burke, who was senior science adviser at the EPA during Barack Obama’s administration. “These rules are essential if the US is going to address the climate crisis and so the past month has been very encouraging. The agency seems to be on the rebound.” If last year’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its $370bn in clean energy subsidies and enticements for electric car buyers, was the carrot to reducing emissions, the EPA now appears to be bringing a hefty stick. The IRA should help reduce US emissions by about 40% this decade but the cut needs to be deeper, up to half of 2005 levels, to give the world a chance of avoiding catastrophic heatwaves, wildfires, drought and other climate calamities. The new rules suddenly put America, after years of delay and political rancor, tantalizingly within reach of this. Interactive “It’s clear we’ve reached a pivotal point in human history and it’s on all of us to act right now to protect our future,” said Michael Regan, the administrator of the EPA, in a speech last week at the University of Maryland. The venue was chosen in a nod to the young, climate-concerned voters Joe Biden hopes to court in next year’s presidential election, and who have been dismayed by Biden’s acquiescence to large-scale oil and gas drilling. “Folks, this is our future we are talking about, and we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity for real climate action,” Regan added. “Failure is not an option, indifference is not an option, inaction is not an option.” The various climate rules have involved grueling preparation from an agency still considered understaffed from the Trump years and now face a gamut of challenges. The right-leaning US supreme court limited the EPA’s options for cutting power plant emissions in a ruling last year and further legal challenges from Republican-led states are inevitable. “This rule appears to utterly fly in the face of the rule of law,” said Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia, which triumphed in last year’s case. “We expect that we would once again prevail in court against this out-of-control agency.” Even if the regulations survive the whim of the courts, they could still be overturned by a future president or reversed by Congress using a review mechanism that will only be negated if the rules are finalized and enacted by next summer, a tight timeline. “They do need to go further, faster, but I think the EPA recognizes the urgency on all fronts,” said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen, an environmental campaign group. “Carbon pollution in the power sector is currently unregulated which is a really big hole in tackling the climate crisis. It’s good to see President Biden leaning in on this, even in the face of a Maga majority on the supreme court.” It’s not just climate the EPA has acted upon in recent months. There are new standards for chemical plants, such as those that blight the so-called “Cancer Alley” of the US, from emitting cancer-causing toxins such as benzene, ethylene oxide and vinyl chloride. New rules curbing mercury, arsenic and lead from industrial facilities have been released, as have tighter limits on emissions of soot and the first ever regulations targeting the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (or PFAS) in drinking water. “This action all seems new, it seems different,” said Burke. “Some of the things have made me think, ‘Wow, we were working on that 10 years ago. It’s a shame we lost a decade on it.’” For those inside the agency, the breakneck pace has been enervating. “It’s definitely a race against time,” said one senior EPA official, who asked not to be named. “The clock is ticking. It is a sprint through a marathon and it is exhausting.” The Biden administration will now have to walk the tightrope between opponents who claim the rules will cause the lights to blink off across America – Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat senator and coal baron, said he will block EPA nominees for following a “radical climate agenda” that risks prematurely shuttering coal plants – and ostensibly supportive environmental groups that have complained the power plant rule doesn’t go far enough and has carve-outs for newer and intermittent polluting plants. A key point of contention is the rule’s indirect embrace of carbon capture technology. In order to hew to the supreme court’s verdict from last year, the EPA is requiring emissions cuts that can be reasonably made on-site by individual power plants, rather than to reshape the entire electricity grid towards solar and wind power. These cuts could be made by scrubbing carbon from smokestacks, switching to cleaner fuels such as hydrogen or capturing the emissions and burying them underground, an expensive option that currently isn’t being used by any coal or gas plant in the US. The EPA has now essentially called the bluff of fossil fuel interests that have previously talked up the prospects of carbon capture, but both the industry and environmentalists have now expressed skepticism, with many coal plants expected to shut rather than spend millions of dollars on new equipment and pipelines to bury emissions. Biden also still has to grapple with accusations that his administration is fatally undermining its own progress by continuing to approve oil and gas drilling leases, at a rate faster than even under Trump, despite his promises to end drilling on public lands. The controversial decision in March to allow the vast Willow oil project in Alaska – a development that former vice-president Al Gore called “recklessly irresponsible” – will result in nearly half of the emissions the power plant rule will avoid over a 30-year period. “We know the work to confront the climate crisis doesn’t stop at strong carbon pollution standards,” said Ben Jealous, the executive director of the Sierra Club. “The continued use or expansion of fossil power plants is incompatible with a livable future. Simply put, we must not merely limit the use of fossil fuel electricity – we must end it entirely.”</body>

    <head>The EU should start planning now for Russia after Putin</head>
    <body>Twenty-seven years before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in what now seems a very distant past, the European Union considered sanctioning Russia. In 1995, following Russia’s military intervention in Chechnya, EU leaders suspended the ratification of a planned partnership and cooperation agreement and threatened Moscow with even greater consequences if its war crimes, including the indiscriminate bombing of Chechen civilians, did not stop. The Boris Yeltsin government dealt with the conflict in Chechnya by unleashing further brutal military force, but Europe eventually backed down and ratified the agreement anyway. In the years that followed, Russia’s leadership went on to dismantle democratic institutions, invade Georgia in 2008 and ignite a war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, the prologue to the full-scale invasion of February 2022. Looking back at the missed opportunities of the 1990s is a reminder of how immediate dilemmas can lead policymakers to overlook signs of the next crisis on the horizon. As it responds to the carnage caused by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine, the EU cannot afford not to prepare for the next Russian crisis. The war in Ukraine, much like the war in Chechnya in the 1990s, has put immense pressure on Russia’s stability as a state. It is critical that EU member states and institutions start to plan for a range of postwar and post-Putin scenarios in Russia, including a destabilisation of the Russian political system that could lead even to armed conflict within the country. To protect the collective interests of Europe, including Ukraine, from any future turmoil engulfing Russia, the EU needs a strategy that actively encourages its democratisation, no matter how small the chances of that now seem. The Kremlin has long dismissed Brussels as a global player. After European condemnation of the brutalities committed during the Chechen wars, Moscow tried to divide and rule, breaking down the bloc’s values-based unity, engaging individual leaders, identifying the most influential member states and their national interests. In many cases, Russia received the amount of economic and political integration with western nations it wanted while sidestepping domestic democratic reform. ‘The Kremlin has long dismissed Brussels as a global player.’ the European Parliament building in Brussels. Photograph: Omar Havana/Getty Images Moscow’s cynical fixation on the interests of individual EU member states both reflected and cast a long shadow over the Russian perception of the EU. Even opposition-minded members of Russian civil society viewed the EU as an imbalanced confederation with big powers dictating the bloc’s economic and foreign policies. Economic growth, travel freedoms and cooperation with individual EU member states left them blind to the gradual decline of freedom in Russia. Russian elites acquired foreign language skills and enough stolen or oil-driven wealth to holiday comfortably in western Europe without bothering to endorse democratic values at home. For Russia’s middle and upper class, this bargain with Moscow and Brussels ended with the invasion of Ukraine. Having lost any influence over Putin, Russian elites chose either to lie low, escape the country, or start infighting by shifting the blame for the crisis on to one another. If Russia manages to avoid a full-scale slide into totalitarianism, what remains of its democratic opposition may finally be able to acknowledge the EU’s capacity to exert transformative progressive power. Ukrainian frustration with any deeper EU engagement with Russia would be understandable, but fostering a shift away from Russian imperialism would be in the interests of all of Russia’s neighbours. Since Moscow’s current elite will accuse the EU of interfering anyway, the EU has nothing to lose by having a wider debate about democratic reform in post-Putin Russia. A postwar Russia trying to overcome Putin’s toxic legacy would have much to learn much from an economically prosperous bloc that has brought together and transformed societies that had once fought each other in two world wars. But EU institutions would have to set out the detailed steps that Russia’s state elite must take as strict conditions for the reopening of trade, travel and investment access to the rest of Europe. They would also provide incentives. A genuine process of reform that launched the rule of law and acknowledged Russia’s post-conflict obligations to Ukraine and other affected states could be rewarded with the promise of negotiations with Brussels. European distrust of Russia runs deep so the EU should be resolute about verification at every stage of this process. Many Russians are familiar with the principle of “trust but verify”, which underpinned talks on nuclear disarmament in the Gorbachev-Reagan era. But only an unwavering commitment to verification can rebuild trust. As trust is gradually restored, Russia could over time gain integration into the EU’s single market, the basis for Europe’s successful economic and social order. It might sound premature to discuss strategies for stimulating Russian reform. But there may be only a fragile window of opportunity to support genuine transformation in Russia. It will require Russians to abandon the imperialist delusions of the Putin regime. If they can do so, there may be a path towards a common European home for all. The west must not lose sight of the potential for positive change in Russia, even as it supports Ukraine in its struggle for survival.

    <head>‘It seems so corny!’ How Jennifer Hosten became the first Black Miss World – and an international diplomat</head>
    <body>Jennifer Hosten was 23 years old when she made history, as the first Black woman to be crowned Miss World. Footage of that evening, on 20 November 1970, was broadcast live from the Royal Albert Hall in London to about 100 million viewers worldwide, and shows Hosten, representing Grenada, looking radiantly beautiful and endearingly stunned, as host Bob Hope places the winner’s crown on her head. Her moment in the spotlight had already been overshadowed, however. Approximately 40 minutes earlier, the proceedings were interrupted when a group of women’s liberation activists began sounding football rattles and throwing flour-bombs in protest at what they saw as an egregious display of sexism. Hosten, who was backstage at that point, could only hear the demonstrators. “I don’t think I was scared,” she says, “but the sound made us wonder what was going on. People thought the contest had come to an end.” Once order was restored, a visibly shaken Hope returned to the stage and attempted to assign meaning to the melee: “I want to tell you anybody that would try to break up an affair as wonderful as this … with these wonderful girls from the entire world, have got to be on some kind of dope!” Hosten as Miss World in 1970. Photograph: Bill Zygmant/REX/Shutterstock In the half-century since, Miss World 1970 has been touted as an example of the need for “intersectional feminism”, before the phrase had even been invented. Was the contest ever really intended as a celebration of international womanhood? Or was it always just an organised excuse for an ogle? Either way, in the eye of the storm, Miss World herself found some clarity: “It seemed like all these things were supposed to happen, that it was meant to be,” says Hosten, who is now 75, from her home just outside Toronto, Canada. “At that point, I realised how much I had to do on my own.” Even if the event made her a global celebrity, Miss World was by no means the culmination of Hosten’s career: she would go on to travel the world, meet movie stars and heads of state, obtain several advanced degrees and have a ringside seat for history in the making. She has very much written her own script. Hosten was born in 1947 in St George’s, the picturesque capital of her Caribbean island home, the youngest of five children. It was an idyllic childhood, characterised by morning sea-swims and evenings spent gathered around the radio, which fostered a patriotism that Hosten has carried throughout her life. “When I look back on my childhood I realise I really was quite blessed,” she says. “We didn’t know about drugs and we didn’t have social media to contend with. We made our own fun.” Jennifer Hosten with her brother Robin, her mother and father, and her sister Pommie. Photograph: Sutherland House As her parents were professionals – her father a prominent lawyer, her mother a schoolteacher – there were standards to live up to, but the family were not part of any island elite, she says. “Grenada is a small community, so the structures are not so defined, not like in England,” although she describes Grenadians at the time as more class conscious than colour conscious. “Most of us were of mixed blood,” she says, and describes her own heritage as including African, Scottish, Flemish and Carib Indian. The radio was Hosten’s main window into a world beyond Grenada, and after leaving school, she pursued a career in broadcasting, eventually travelling to London, aged 18, to enrol on a BBC training scheme. After nearly two years in the UK, and six months as an au pair in France, she returned to Grenada a cosmopolitan, bilingual, polished woman of 20 – an ideal candidate to work as a flight attendant for British West Indies Airways. It was in this role that a series of events – “what you might consider coincidences, which I don’t think are coincidences, really” – propelled her towards her date with destiny at the Royal Albert Hall. There was a fateful in-flight meeting with the recently crowned Miss Guyana; happening to pick up a discarded newspaper reporting Grenada’s plans to send a representative to Miss World; and bumping into an old friend whose mother was the head of Grenada’s tourist board. He persuaded Hosten to compete, suggesting Miss World would be no different from the traditional carnival queen contests she had participated in as a teenager. “They were never really about beauty. They were always more about promoting the culture of the island,” she says. “Throughout the Caribbean, you were considered ‘attractive’, rather than ‘beautiful’; and that meant that you had a nice smile, that you presented yourself well.” I can’t believe that’s how I answered questions! It makes you cringe, you know? Miss World was very different. “The objectification was exemplified by having to turn around for your backside to be judged,” she says. “Even back then, it was shocking, because I never had to do that in Grenada. And it was shocking to my daughter, who later saw the contest. She was embarrassed for me. She said: ‘Oh Mum, I can’t imagine that you had to do that!’” Hosten is also a little embarrassed for her younger self, watching the footage back. “It seems so corny. I can’t believe that’s how I answered questions! It makes you cringe, you know? But that’s what it was.” Her win made the front pages around the world, but Hosten was disturbed by the tone of much of the reporting. “The first time I ever saw myself as a minority was when I came to England for Miss World, because the day after I won, the headline was: Miss World is Black,” she says. “I found it shocking that your colour or race should be a headline … because even if they thought of me as Black, was that the most important thing for them to be highlighting?” The same articles often included allegations that the contest must have been rigged, since the judging panel included the Grenadian premier, Eric Gairy. Hosten found this risible: “There were three British judges, there was also an African judge, a judge from Denmark, I think there was a judge from India … and all of a sudden, the one from Grenada should have made the difference?” It seemed to her the fuss was a cover for their true objections: “It was really because there were two women of colour [Pearl Jansen, Miss Africa South, placed second], and the fact that I wasn’t the standard European type of winner. [In their minds] I could not possibly, naturally, have been able to win. It was hurtful.” Protesters invade the Royal Albert Hall during the 1970 Miss World contest. Photograph: Leonard Burt/Getty Images Coming face to face with the women’s lib protesters was, by comparison, less disconcerting. When crowds singing the protest song We Shall Overcome accosted an official Miss World coach en route to the Royal Albert Hall that day, she remembers some of the contestants on board joined in the singing. “Well, at one level we thought, this is a women’s demonstration, and we’re women.” Hosten says she agreed with much of what the UK women’s liberation movement had to say, but they made one great tactical error: “They never reached out to us at any point in time, to explain anything about what they were trying to achieve, or who they were against.” If they had, she would have tried to describe to them her experience – as a woman of colour from one of the smallest nations in the world – and how it might differ from theirs, as white women in the UK. “I was able to represent women that really had not had an opportunity like this. And let’s be frank: it was a stepping stone for most of us. I never saw myself as a beauty contest winner, really. I saw it as an opportunity, which I took, to have an experience, and to make some money!” At that time, the simple fact of a Black woman being proclaimed the world’s “most beautiful” sent a powerfully countercultural message. While the “Black is beautiful” movement had been challenging internalised racism among African Americans since the early 1960s, in much of the western world the existence of women with darker skin tones or afro hair textures was ignored by the media and the cosmetics industry. “It was always a job to find something that would really complement my skin,” says Hosten. “When I won, no cosmetic companies or hair product companies contacted me to advertise for them, as they had done for previous Miss Worlds.” Hosten realised she was also carrying a banner for long underrepresented women of colour from all over the world: “I think I was one of the first Miss Worlds to be invited to Africa, for instance. I didn’t accept the invitation to South Africa, during the height of apartheid, but I did go to Nigeria, and pass through Ghana, and they were wonderful to me, just like a homecoming.” Hosten and Bob Hope on Hope’s Christmas tour of US military bases. Photograph: AP If Hosten’s only goal had been personal advancement, she’d likely have parlayed her Miss World fame into a showbiz career. There was ample opportunity, including all the contacts she made on Bob Hope’s Christmas tour of US military bases. Despite Hope’s self-perpetuated reputation as a womaniser, she describes the man she got to know as an avuncular, if slightly detached figure, who continued to send her a Christmas card every year for decades afterwards. “It was only ever addressed to ‘Miss World, Jennifer Hosten, Grenada’, but somehow it always got to me.” Then there was a teatime tête-à-tête at Joan Crawford’s New York home, which Hosten remembers as a flurry of small dogs and big hats, during which the Hollywood star personally invited Hosten to enrol at her acting school. Instead, after fulfilling her year of contractual obligations, she went a different way. Many beauty queens claim to strive for “world peace”, but few have put those words into action as literally as Hosten has. A year after Miss World, she married a Canadian IBM manager named David Craig and set up home with him in rural Ontario, where they raised two children and Hosten did the daily commute to her customer relations job at Air Canada on a snowmobile. One day in 1978, however, she received a phone call from Gairy, by then the Grenadian prime minister, inviting her to serve as high commissioner (equivalent to ambassador) to Canada. Being a woman meant she was expected to be ambassador and ambassador’s wife, combining her diplomatic duties with the full domestic schedule of a mother of two. “I would have to come home and plan the cocktail parties, organise the childcare. I remember an occasion where [former Canadian PM] Pierre Trudeau came to my home and read the children a bedtime story … That was quite special.” Special, but also a nightmare of parenting logistics: “I was the one that had to arrange for them to actually go to bed, and here I was, also the ambassador.” Any notion that this would be a ceremonial role was soon dramatically disproven. “I was returning from a UN meeting in Ecuador when the government fell,” she says, referring to the 1979 coup in Grenada led by Maurice Bishop, the leader of the Marxist-Leninist New Jewel Movement (NJM) and an old acquaintance from her London days. “I had to very quickly use whatever skills I had, and get recognition for the new government. I think I was instrumental in that, actually.” Hosten stayed on until 1981, through what would turn out to be one of her nation’s most tumultuous chapters. She is critical of the fallen Gairy government, describing it as “verging on authoritarian” and presiding over a long discontented populace: “The people wanted independence [from Britain, which happened in 1974], but they didn’t want independence under that government.” The NJM government, however, soon descended into something “much worse … total abuse of power, the doing away of all freedoms”. In 1983 Bishop was executed by dissident members of his own party, triggering a US invasion. These are events that Hosten is still sorting through in her mind. “There is actually much more to that story that I can tell, that I will sometime write about. I don’t know if they’ll ever publish it.” With their children grown up and their careers taking them to different countries, Hosten and her husband divorced after 28 years of “a fairly good marriage”. She went on to marry – and separate – twice more and accept other high-level diplomatic and trade roles, including at the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and Canada’s High Commission in Bangladesh before, aged 60, retraining once again, as a psychotherapist and counsellor. These days Hosten is a proud grandmother who enjoys a close relationship with her family, as well as keeping in touch with the many friends she has made around the world. Throughout all her reinventions, she has retained the grace and sincerity that won her that 1970 title. Hosten at the Misbehaviour premiere in London, in 2020. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy In 2020, the events of the 1970 Miss World were dramatised in the movie Misbehaviour, with Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Hosten and Keira Knightley as Sally Alexander, the organiser of the women’s rights protest. It was during the publicity tour for Misbehaviour, listening to Knightley discuss her choice of acting roles, that Hosten landed on a useful analogy forher own sense of identity: “She’s played pirates in the Caribbean, and been in Jane Austen adaptations, and lots of other types of movies, because actresses don’t like to be typecast,” she says. “Well, people don’t want to be typecast … I didn’t want to be remembered just as a beauty contest winner, because there are so many other sides to us.” This plurality of womanhood is what Hosten hoped – and still hopes – to convey: “I don’t know how far [the women’s movement] has come in the sense of really including the interests of a broader section of women,” she concludes. “But I do think they achieved a great deal and I really have to congratulate them. What, it seems to me, is still missing, is asking: who are we to be limiting the roles of other women?”</body>

    <head>‘Beowulf is lit AF’ – could ChatGPT really write good book blurbs?</head>
    <body>“Blurb writing is a mini art form,” Iris Murdoch once wrote in a letter to former Penguin blurb writer Elizabeth Buchan. And like many other art forms, companies have been experimenting with the idea that it could be created without an artist. A German company that provides digital book distribution and marketing services to publishers has announced it will integrate ChatGPT, a chatbot that answers questions by drawing on publicly available internet data, into its software. Related: The big idea: Should we worry about artificial intelligence? “During the beta phase, publishers can test the benefits of the artificial intelligence tool for their digital book marketing,” states Bookwire, adding that it will only use ChatGPT if a publisher agrees and the disclaimer that the company “does not assume any responsibility for the content created by ChatGPT”. This raises plenty of ethical concerns, of course, which will no doubt enrage those in the books industry – Bradford literature festival recently came under fire on social media for its use of an AI-generated promotional image, and the Society of Authors published a paper at the beginning of May warning the industry needs to “protect copyright and creative careers in the face of new technology”. But there is also another question that needs to be asked. I decided to test the limits of ChatGPT’s “imagination” by asking it to write blurbs and endorsements for a range of well-known titles, from a heroic poem to a modern romance novel. After playing around with a variety of commands, here are some of the highlights. A juicy blurb of a George Eliot classic: Middlemarch is the ultimate “Real Housewives” of 19th century England. Follow the lives of wealthy aristocrats as they navigate love, lust, and gossip in a society that’s more cutthroat than the latest reality TV show. With scandalous affairs, juicy secrets, and plenty of backstabbing, this book has more drama than a season of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” So grab your popcorn and get ready for a wild ride! A blurb of an Old English epic poem that would appeal to Gen Z: Yo, have you checked out Beowulf? This dude’s a total savage, taking down monsters left and right like it’s NBD [no big deal]. His skills are on point and he’s got a fearless attitude that’s straight-up inspiring. Plus, his adventures are full of epic battles and drama that’ll have you shook. And you know what’s even better? Beowulf’s got plenty of admirers, so the romance is totally on point too. Trust me, this story is the lit AF, and you won’t wanna miss it. A blurb for the Bible, for those looking for their next self-help read: The ultimate guide to life, love, and eternal salvation! With enough drama and plot twists to rival Game of Thrones, it’s sure to keep you entertained for thousands of years to come. Laugh, cry, and gasp in awe at the epic stories of Adam and Eve, Noah and the flood, and Jesus and his miracles. Don’t miss out on this divine masterpiece! A tweet promoting an Irish classic: OH MY GOSH, have you read Ulysses yet?! It’s the most mind-blowing, soul-stirring, literary masterpiece I’ve ever laid my eyes on! James Joyce is an absolute genius and this book will take you on a journey that will leave you breathless! Trust me, you don’t wanna miss out! #Ulysses #JamesJoyce #MindBlowing #LiteraryGenius #LifeChanging Publishers love enthusiastic one-line endorsements to slap on the front of book jackets too. We asked ChatGPT to come up with some candidates. Beloved by Toni Morrison in the style of Shakespeare: Oh, wondrous and magnificent Beloved, whose words doth pierce through the heart like a thousand arrows of truth, leaving one awestruck and enraptured in its devastatingly beautiful tale of love, loss, and redemption. Colleen Hoover’s It Ends With Us in the style of Stephen Fry: If you’re looking for a book that will make you ugly-cry in public, It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover is your golden ticket – just make sure to pack plenty of tissues and a disguise. One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez in the style of Rishi Sunak: Reading One Hundred Years of Solitude is like investing in a cultural masterpiece that will appreciate in value with every page turned. In seriousness, ChatGPT produces near-passable blurbs when fed the right commands. Descriptions of books are generally accurate. Yet, there are flaws, the biggest of which is that the blurbs are full of cliches – every book is a “masterpiece” or “tapestry”. It recalls George Orwell’s overworked book reviewer, who sits down to write and “All the stale old phrases […] jump into their places like iron filings obeying the magnet.” With ChatGPT, that metaphor becomes literal, the cringeworthy phrases spat out one-by-one on the screen in real time. So rest easy, blurbers and reviewers – you’re still needed (at least for now).</body>

    <head>Tiananmen Square books removed from Hong Kong libraries in run-up to anniversary</head>
    <body>Books about the Tiananmen Square massacre, Hong Kong protest movements, and other subjects deemed politically sensitive by Beijing have been removed from the former British colony’s public libraries in the lead-up to the 34th anniversary of the killings. Hong Kong media have reported a marked increase in the number of book and documentary removals, which have been growing since the authoritarian clampdown on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and the introduction of the national security law in 2020. It has resulted in a significant curtailing of political freedoms in the city and multiple arrests. Late last month, the government’s audit commission report said the leisure and cultural services department, which operates Hong Kong’s libraries, needed to “step up efforts in examining library materials for safeguarding national security and taking follow-up actions”. The report said Hong Kong Public Libraries had completed a preliminary review of books that focused on authors and publishers “suspected of publishing books on ‘Hong Kong independence’ previously”. It said the review of titles, which began in 2021, was ongoing and unlikely to have a clear end date. On Tuesday, Hong Kong media outlets reported the review appeared to have stripped from public shelves hundreds of books about the massacre of student protesters on 4 June 1989. Photon Media searched for 149 titles that were available in 2009 and found only four still listed. Ming Pao reported that about 40% of politically themed books, magazines and videos available at the end of 2020 were gone, 96 of them removed this year. It said a number of documentaries, including by the public broadcaster RTHK, were also absent. A Guardian search of the Hong Kong public libraries’ online catalogue returned some titles related to the Tiananmen massacre but most were shown to have “no lending copy available on shelf”. Four books on the “umbrella movement” protests were shown to have copies available. “Books with content suspected of breaching the national security law or other local laws are removed immediately for a review,” a spokesperson for the leisure and cultural services department told the South China Morning Post. Government figures have defended the targeting of books as safeguarding national security. The Hong Kong chief executive, John Lee, said books were still available for purchase at private bookshops – a claim disputed by activists and residents, who noted that several bookshops have closed or removed sensitive books from their stock in fear of contravening the national security law. School libraries had already removed books deemed to be politically sensitive in the months after the introduction of the law. “What libraries need to do is ensure that books that may not be suitable for circulation, that they have to do their duties,” Hong Kong’s secretary for security, Chris Tang, said on Tuesday. “The principles we use, which I support, is first if all to ensure there is no breach of any laws in Hong Kong, including of course copyright etcetera, and also if they spread any kind of messages that are not in the interest of Hong Kong.” Tang said he was sure that “safeguarding national security is high on the agenda of each and every individual department and bureau”. In 2021, Tang had said the cultural and media sectors were an emerging source of national security threats, where pro-independence activists might conduct “soft resistance”. Government targeting of media and literature has continued, with one of the most notable examples being the conviction for sedition of five members of a physical therapists’ union over the publication of a children’s book. The judge found that the book, which depicted sheep fleeing from invading wolves, aimed to incite hatred against China. Late last month, Google revealed in its biannual report that the Hong Kong police had sought to have content related to the book taken off the internet because the court considered it to be “seditious”. Google refused. Increasing censorship under the remit of the national security law has also targeted media outlets, cartoons, films, documentaries, and art exhibitions. In response, a growing number of international projects are archiving or publishing the targeted content. Several are operating under the radar, according to one operator of a project receiving sensitive books donated by people Hong Kong for foreign redistribution. He said people passed books along from friend to friend, driven by a need to preserve titles and information about Hong Kong society and history.</body>

    <head>No chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef in future trade deals, Sunak vows</head>
    <body>Rishi Sunak has vowed to take chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef off British tables in future trade deals, promising to put UK farming at the heart of government trade policy. “There will be no chlorine-washed chicken and no hormone-treated beef on the UK market. Not now, not ever,” he will tell farmers in a letter unveiling a new government policy to improve British food security. And in a swipe at his predecessor, Liz Truss, the prime minister will also tell the farming community that they will not be “an afterthought” in deals with foreign farmers. At the first Farm to Fork summit in Downing Street, the government will outline a new approach to improving food security, with targets that the UK produces 60% of the food consumed in the country. The National Farmers’ Union and other agricultural bodies have spent most of the seven Brexit years battling to persuade the government that giving other countries with lower standards and cheaper food production access to British markets is counterproductive. Welsh farmers said they had been “chucked under the bus” by Truss’s race to get deals with industrial-scale Australian rivals who could undercut local farmers. Sunak will tell farmers: “When you consider the scale of the opportunities within our grasp as we forge new trade deals around the world, British farming and British produce simply cannot be an afterthought. I know that is how some of you felt in the past.” He will also tell food chiefs that he is fully committed to ensuring “without exception” that he will never do a deal that includes chlorinated chicken or beef from hormone-fed cattle, practices associated with factory farms in the US. Sunak’s commitments put his policies into sharp contrast with predecessors Truss and Boris Johnson, whose thirst for a US trade deal was stymied by his policy on Northern Ireland. The president of the National Farmers’ Union, Minette Batters, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Sunak was making a commitment previously absent from government policy. Related: Concern as UK minister confirms beef could be imported from Mexico “People will be full of understanding that we have had three very different prime ministers in the last year and in fairness, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has set out a very different agenda. “He has made it very clear in black and white that there will be sensitive sectors in all trade deals. This played out in the Trans Pacific deal, [the CPTPP] and we are going to see sensitive sectors [protected] from now on and he’s saying farmers will be at the heart of this,” she said. “[He has] also put it in black and white that we will never be importing hormone-treated beef or chlorine-washed chicken so I think everything that we have done has had huge impact on the people of this country are absolutely behind that ambition. I’m delighted to see him support it.” Food security was put into sharp focus last year when the UK and other countries in Europe experienced shortages of salad items due to weather-impacted crops in southern Europe. This year, fears were expressed about trade deal links to deforestation in Mexico after a government minister said beef from the country could hit UK supermarket shelves under a new trade deal. At the time, Batters said: “I am very concerned about links to deforestation. From Mexico our lines are pretty tough on this having given away so much on beef to Australia and New Zealand. We want the government to take a very, very firm line on further imports of beef.” Reacting to Sunak’s letter, a spokesperson for the campaign group Global Justice Now, said: “The best way for the prime minister to show he’s serious would be to give parliament a binding vote on future trade deals so he can be held to his word. “Instead, last month he even scrapped the dedicated committee that scrutinises them. This looks like another empty promise from a government that has put City profits ahead of protecting food standards time and again.” Meanwhile, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called on the government to halt rocketing food prices. Analysis by Labour of the government’s statistical dataset of the average price of wholesale home-grown vegetables shows that British-grown tomatoes cost 67% more than they did at the same time in 2019. In the 19th week of 2019, the average wholesale price for a kilogram of cherry tomatoes cost £1.79; however, the latest price in May 2023 stands at £3.00. The rocketing prices also include a 109% increase for the price of a head of cauliflower, a 95% increase on asparagus, an 82% increase on strawberries and 62% on leeks. Analysis by the Liberal Democrats has also found that even though the wholesale prices on basic products such as bread-making wheat and fruit and veg have tumbled in recent months, prices for consumers in supermarkets have continued to soar.</body>

    <head>Rishi Sunak to push for Europe-wide approach to illegal migration</head>
    <body>Rishi Sunak will plead with other world leaders at a summit on Tuesday for cooperation to tackle illegal migration as he seeks to reassert his authority over the restless right of his party. He will also seek to use a rare meeting with the president of the European court of human rights (ECHR) to win backing for UK attempts to overcome rules that blocked the first scheduled deportation flight to Rwanda. The international system for policing human trafficking is not working, Sunak will say in an address in Reykjavík at a meeting of the Council of Europe – a gathering of leaders from the EU, other European states and the ECHR. Sunak’s renewed push for a Europe-wide approach comes after France previously rejected Britain’s calls for a bilateral returns agreement for migrants crossing the Channel, insisting that there was a need for a wider EU agreement. However, his most important meeting in Iceland could be his discussions with Síofra O’Leary, the ECHR’s president, over planned changes to how rule 39 works – an order that prevented the inaugural deportation flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda last summer. He is expected to tell her that reform is needed to create an international system that allows states to protect their borders and help people most in need. Looming over the talks is the memory of Sunak caving in last month to demands from hard-right MPs to allow the UK to ignore rulings from the European court of human rights on small boat crossings. Backbench rebels had been pushing the prime minister to harden the illegal migration bill so ministers could ignore interim rulings. One of the Strasbourg court’s rule 39 injunctions blocked the government’s first attempt to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda last year. The trip comes as migration tops the political agenda, with the home secretary, Suella Braverman, arguing in a speech at Monday’s National Conservatism conference that Britain “must not lose sight of the importance of controlling legal migration”, as well as preventing people from entering via unauthorised channels. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Home Office had privately shared figures with No 10 suggesting more than 1.1 million foreign workers and students could arrive in Britain in 2024-25, just as the Tories face a general election test. Speaking before the trip, the prime minister said: “Every single point on each route used by people traffickers to smuggle people across our continent represents another community struggling to deal with the human cost of this barbaric enterprise.” “It is very clear that our current international system is not working, and our communities and the world’s most vulnerable people are paying the price. “We need to do more to cooperate across borders and across jurisdictions to end illegal migration and stop the boats. I am clear that as an active European nation with a proud history helping those in need, the UK will be at the heart of this.”</body>

    <head>Boohoo swings to £91m loss as shoppers return more items</head>
    <body>Boohoo.com has dived almost £91m into the red as its annual sales fell and it wrestled with higher levels of returned products as shoppers stepped out of their easy-fit jogging bottoms and hoodies and back on to high streets. The online fast fashion business said sales fell 11% to £1.8bn in the year to 28 February, including a 9% fall in the UK. It warned that sales were likely to fall by as much as 5% in the year ahead as shoppers reined in spending amid cost of living concerns. Performance in the US was particularly poor, with sales down 24% over the year, if currency effects were stripped out, as delivery times were held back and the cost of flying products from the UK rose. Related: What has gone wrong at John Lewis and Waitrose – and can they survive? Boohoo said it had made a pretax loss of £90.7m, compared with a profit of £92.2m a year before. The number of shoppers visiting its websites fell 10% to 18 million over the year but was still up 29% over three years as it gained customers during the Covid lockdowns. However, Boohoo said underlying profits would rise in the year ahead as it made cost cuts and expected deflation in costs, which have risen in the past year including freight, warehousing and energy. It also incurred one-off costs in putting more automation into its Sheffield warehouse, laying off some staff and setting up a warehouse in the US. The Boohoo chief executive, John Lyttle, said: “Over the last three years, the group has achieved significant market share gains. Looking ahead, we are investing for the future growth of this business with automation, local fulfilment capacity in the US and building global brand awareness. “Our confidence in the medium-term prospects for the group remain unchanged, and as we execute on our key priorities we see a clear path to improved profitability and getting back to double digit revenue growth.” Boohoo’s difficulties emerge after Asos revealed last week it had slumped £291m into the red as sales slumped in what the online fashion retailer called a “challenging trading backdrop”, with shoppers returning to physical high street stores and cutting spending on non-essentials. The reopening of high streets and caution among consumers, as well as the rising burden of handling deliveries and returns as a result of surging energy and labour costs, are squeezing online retailers. Competition has stepped up from companies such as China’s fast fashion online specialist Shein as well as moves by Next and Marks &amp; Spencer to sell a wider array of brands online. Boohoo said it had swung to a loss as a result of falling sales and rising costs as shoppers returned more items than they had before the pandemic, partly as people bought more fitted dresses and occasion wear rather than the hoodies and jogging bottoms that were popular during lockdowns. Higher costs at the series of brands Boohoo snapped up during the pandemic including Debenhams, Burton and Dorothy Perkins also contributed to losses.</body>

    <head>Vice is going bankrupt, BuzzFeed News is dead. What does it mean?</head>
    <body>In a seminal 2009 essay, Newspapers and Thinking the Unthinkable, the brilliant New York University professor Clay Shirky made the point that journalism as we had known it for decades was finished – and for good reason. The reason, in a mere two words: the internet. And he certainly proved right. With a few notable exceptions, newspapers – once the core of American journalism – have been dying right and left. Related: When journalists are persecuted, we all suffer | Margaret Sullivan Now, big digital media-news companies, once the great hope of post-print news, seem to be going in the same direction. Down, down, down. In recent weeks and months, digital newsrooms have taken huge hits. BuzzFeed News suddenly shuttered, leaving scores of extremely talented journalists without employment (and lest you think of BuzzFeed as strictly a place for viral videos about cats, recall that its news division did plenty of prize-winning journalism over the years). Vox Media recently laid off 7% of its staff and raised money based on a valuation about half of what it was worth in 2015. Then, on Monday, another major blow: Vice was filing for bankruptcy. A New York Times report was unsparing, calling Vice a “decayed digital colossus”, and noting that at one point it was thought to be worth a now-unfathomable $5.7bn. It’s just as Shirky predicted it more than a decade ago, as he compared the coming of the internet to the arrival of Gutenberg’s printing press. Communication was utterly upended. “This is what real revolutions are like. The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place,” Shirky wrote. And, amid the ensuing chaos, it’s extremely hard to see what’s going next: “The importance of any given experiment isn’t apparent at the moment it appears, big changes stall, small changes spread.” And so it is with the news media – journalism, let’s call it – in the digital age. Many of the biggest experiments are failing. The problem in digital news? The audience, in many cases, was there. But the profits didn’t follow, or at least not in a sustainable way. Digital advertising revenue, once thought to be based on audience size, was going instead to social-media platforms, particularly Facebook. Venture capitalists who had funded the news sites grew disenchanted and impatient. “Many, many things went wrong,” Ben Smith, the former top BuzzFeed News editor, told Jon Favreau on his Offline podcast, noting in something of an understatement that “social media wasn’t going to work out the way we thought it was”. (Disclosure: I was recruited to succeed Smith at BuzzFeed News; I dropped out of the running early on.) In fact, said Smith, whose new book, Traffic, traces the rise and decline of the digital-news dream, “the internet itself is kind of falling apart”. That may be overstating it, but Twitter users – and hundreds of laid-off journalists – would find it hard to disagree. So when it comes to news in the fully digital age, what will work? What will be successful, not only financially but in serving the public’s need for fact-based news and information? That’s a tricky question because we’re still fully in the grip of the digital revolution and the chaos that Shirky recognized. Some experiments are failing; others are taking hold. It’s heartening to see the success of quality digital-first news sites like ProPublica, which depend heavily – though not exclusively – on philanthropy. The New York Times is thriving in the digital age, due partly to initiatives that have nothing to do with news – addictive puzzles, a cooking app and the product-review site known as Wirecutter. The Wall Street Journal has an impenetrable paywall and a wealthy audience who find its business coverage indispensable. The small local-news site Mississippi Today – funded through membership, events and philanthropy – won a Pulitzer prize last month; it was founded only seven years ago. News companies that are owned by billionaires, such as the Washington Post, may have more stability than most, but still find themselves grappling with the loss of advertising revenue; even billionaires don’t want to sustain losses indefinitely. (That became clear to me as editor of the Buffalo News, once owned by Warren Buffett, who got out of the newspaper business entirely a few years ago after declaring in an interview that the industry had become nothing but “toast”.) The Guardian, owned by the Scott Trust and sustained by its endowment, is also supported by its readers, an essential component of its current financial health. The truth is there’s no single solution – and that’s not at all surprising this early in the digital revolution. “Diversified revenue,” is Smith’s best answer to a sustainable business model for journalism’s future. He’s right. Newspapers were far too dependent on print advertising and once that fell off a cliff in 2008, so did they. BuzzFeed and many others bet big on the distribution model of social media but without fully realizing that the platforms would siphon off the digital-ad dollars. My deepest hope is that news consumers – also known as citizens – and philanthropists alike recognize the importance of quality reporting and are willing to support it. In this time of uncertainty, the importance of good journalism is the one sure bet. Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture</body>

    <head>Treasurer wants energy transition to be his legacy – as it happened</head>
    <body>8.53am BST What we learned; Tuesday 16 May That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today – thanks so much for joining us. Here is a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: Police had a “bizarre approach” to the Bruce Lehrmann case, and Brittany Higgins’s allegation of rape would have been ignored had it not allegedly taken place in parliament house, a lawyer has told the inquiry into Lehrmann’s trial. Opposition leader Peter Dutton called the Nazis on the steps of Victoria’s parliament house “scumbags” and “sick individuals.” An international group has scored Australia’s latest UN climate pledge a “zero” because it fails to recognise the health risks and benefits of its approach to reach its greenhouse gas reduction targets. Queensland police say a teenager is in serious condition after being stabbed on school grounds in Kamerunga, a suburb of Cairns. A retail worker in Melbourne’s CBD has been stabbed and is seriously injured after they confronted two people allegedly attempting to steal a bag, Victoria police said. Transport union leaders gave the NSW premier, Chris Minns, a standing ovation as he pledged to amend the state’s decades-old workplace laws to include ride-share and food delivery drivers. The disability royal commission has found that Anglicare failed to properly investigate allegations that a woman, known by the pseudonym of Niky, was sexually assaulted at one of its respite centres in southern Queensland. Billionaire businessman James Packer has given $7m to UNSW for mental health research and the establishment of a chair in his name on mood disorders. Human trafficking support services will get a $24m boost as the government works to crack down on modern slavery. Updated at 9.04am BST 8.35am BST New South Wales needs to rapidly double the number of apartments being built every year, according to the state’s building commissioner, David Chandler. He said the state was currently building 14,000 to 15,000 apartments annually but that number needed to reach 30,000, and he would need to ensure they were built to a high standard if the public was to regain trust in new builds. He said: We’ve got to double. My job is to make sure that those projects that are completed are in fact completed to a level that the public can be confident in. Asked if he agreed with the goal, the premier, Chris Minns, said he was not yet ready to commit to such a figure. He said: We’re working up our growth targets in the metropolitan city area. We’re not ready to release them now. But I did make a promise in the election campaign that I thought it needed to be rebalanced, particularly along public transport routes. Updated at 8.38am BST 8.19am BST AAP is reporting that human remains have been found in dense bushland near an area being searched for a missing man in Western Australia. Police say a member of the public alerted local officers to the discovery near Nannup, about 265km south of Perth, on Monday. Detectives and forensic officers were at the scene on Tuesday working to identify the deceased person. “At this time it is not appropriate to speculate whose the remains may be,” inspector Geoff DeSanges told reporters. “However, the remains were located close to a search area for a man who has been missing since 2021.” No suspicious evidence was found and investigations continue. Updated at 8.22am BST 7.59am BST Victorian clubs and RSLs to be allowed give up pokies entitlements Victorian clubs and RSLs will be able to surrender pokies entitlements they are no longer able to use, with any remaining debt scrapped. Football clubs and RSLs wanting to leave the gambling industry had been unable to offload licenses due to being locked into 20-year deals. Some councils had also barred clubs from operating machines they have entitlements to in an attempt to crack down on gambling harm. The state’s gaming minister, Melissa Horne, said the surrender scheme would allow funds to be reinvested by clubs into their communities: This is good news for clubs and RSLs who have entitlements they can’t use. It means they can put more money back into the communities they support. Updated at 8.05am BST 7.41am BST Supply the ‘missing jigsaw piece’ in NSW housing crisis, premier says Restoring confidence in the troubled NSW high rise apartment industry is key to boosting dwelling numbers and unwinding the escalating housing crisis, the state’s premier said, according to AAP. NSW premier Chris Minns in Sydney on Tuesday. Photograph: Jenny Evans/AAP “Supply is the big part of the missing jigsaw piece of the housing crisis in NSW,” the premier, Chris Minns, told reporters on Tuesday. “I’ve seen for too long confidence being undermined by poorly constructed, poorly built communities and buildings across NSW, which has meant that there hasn’t been the support for dense urban living that we need in a place like Sydney.” The solution ahead lay in more densely populated suburbs filled with high rise apartments, the premier said. “To do it well, you need to have a cop on the beat, who’s looking after the people of the state.” It comes as the Minns government commits to establishing a building commission as the single body overseeing the construction sector. It is hoped the commission will be up and running by the end of this year after the government consults with the sector. The Minns government announced plans to establish the commission in the lead-up to the state election, partly in reaction to the fiasco at Mascot Towers which left owners of the 132-apartment block in Sydney saddled with debt. Led by the NSW building commissioner, David Chandler, the commission will oversee and regulate the construction industry, which comprises 10% of the state’s economy. The government will also introduce legislation to cut red tape, and restrict the operations of private building certifiers, limiting their work to 50% with a single builder or developer. Updated at 7.55am BST 7.16am BST ‘Making most of the energy transformation’ to be Chalmers’ legacy One year into his stint as Australia’s 41st treasurer might be a big early to discuss legacies, but Jim Chalmers was asked about what he thought his might be at a lunch in Sydney today. The gathering, hosted beside a sparkling Sydney Harbour by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) and Business NSW, was mostly a ‘roadshow’ to sell last week’s budget. And the mood was convivial (perhaps because the audience reckons Chalmers and his government might be around for a bit yet) with most topics touched on with a broad brush. Anyway, asked about what he wanted his legacy to be, Chalmers said he “thought a lot about what Paul [Keating] left behind”. “For what was for him, opening the economy up to the world … if we can get one thing right in the time that I’m treasurer it would be that energy transformation.” “So much of what we want to achieve together hinges on that one way or another,” he said, adding the coming decade would be a defining one for Australia. “It will determine whether we were good enough to grab these opportunities, or whether or not they went begging”. An interesting priority, and one that probably means the energy minister, Chris Bowen’s, actions are being watched closely in Chalmers’ office. Updated at 7.23am BST 6.59am BST Australia scores &apos;zero&apos; for UN climate pledge that ignores health impacts An international group has scored Australia’s latest UN climate pledge a “zero” because it fails to recognise the health risks and benefits of it’s approach to reach its greenhouse gas reduction targets. The Global Climate and Health Alliance assessed the climate pledges of the 58 countries that submitted revised versions to the UN’s climate convention between 1 October 2021 and 23 September 2022. In June last year, the Albanese government submitted a revised pledge – known as a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) – to cut emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030, an improvement on the previous Coalition government’s 28% cut. Australia was one of only six countries to score zero in the report, alongside Bahrain, Belarus, Japan, New Zealand and Turkey. Fiona Armstrong, founder of the Australia-based Climate and Health Alliance affiliated with the global group, said: The latest [report] reveals just how far Australia has fallen behind other countries in the last decade when it comes to action to protect people’s health from climate change. As many other countries recognise the deep links between a changing climate and the health of populations, Australia is being left far behind as other countries adopt an integrated approach to climate change. This assessment of Australia’s NDC takes a deep dive into the extent to which climate’s consequences for human health are recognised in Australia’s global commitments to act on climate change. The 0/18 score reflects the current absence of any policies mentioned in the NDC that explicitly invest in health, including, for example, a national climate and health adaptation plan, investment in strengthening the capacity of the health workforce to respond to climate change, or investing in climate strategies that also deliver health benefits. Only 16 countries scored above 10 out of a possible 18 in the report, and all were low to middle income nations, with Burundi in first place and Cote d’Ivoire in second. Updated at 7.53am BST 6.40am BST Victorian farmers’ deadline for flood support pushed back Victorian farmers will have more time to take stock of flood and storm damage after the government pushed back the cut-off date for financial support applications, according to the AAP. The Andrews government on Tuesday announced eligible primary producers would have until 13 July to apply for support – an extension of more than two months from the previous 30 April date. The support programs are joint-funded by the state and federal governments and include flood recovery grants of up to $75,000, rural landholder grants of up to $25,000, transport grants of up to $15,000 and flood recovery concessional loans of up to $250,000. “Last year’s disaster caused significant damage and disruption to communities across Victoria, through flash flooding, landslips, road damage and closures and impacts from fallen trees,” the federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, said. “By extending the date for applications, we’re making sure farmers who were affected later have time to assess damages and complete their applications for financial support.” The state government also announced concessional loans of up to $250,000 for primary producers in the Greater Shepparton and Yarra Ranges local government areas who were affected by the 23 March hailstorm. The storm was the third significant one to hit Greater Shepparton during the horticultural season, Watt said. Melbourne Water was tasked with independently reviewing October’s devastating Maribyrnong river floods.

It comes after revelations that new ministers had been briefed that safety issues might necessitate work on the giant wall. Asked about any possible safety concerns at a press conference this afternoon, Minns said: There are other geotechnical risks associated with the dam wall which means that Water NSW and the board of Water NSW may have to take action in relation to remediating the structure from an engineering point of view. I’m not in a position to release that advice right now but I can confirm we’ve had briefings from engineers at Water NSW about next steps. He would not be drawn on the nature of the concerns, nor the steps needed to fix them. Minns repeatedly ruled out raising the wall by 14 metres, as was promised by the previous government.

Minns said gig economy workers had experienced a decade of rapid growth, but NSW laws had failed to keep up. He said by denying minimum conditions, leave entitlements and other protections available to every other Australian in the workforce, it was almost as if a second class of worker was being engineered. Minns said: Not every issue in politics is about life and death, but this one is. Like many people were, I was shocked in 2020 that five people lost their lives working in this economy.

The minister for climate action, Lily D’Amborsio, on Tuesday formalised the target under Victoria’s Climate Change Act 2017. Advice provided to the government also called for an end to coal power by 2035. She said the government will legislate the 75% to 80% by 2035 target, as well as another to reach net zero emissions by 2045, later this year. Both were key election commitments, alongside its plan to revive the publicly owned State Electricity Commission. The government also plans to reach 95% renewable energy generation and a renewable energy storage target of 6.3 GW by 2035. D’Amborsio said: Victoria has cut emissions by more than any other state since 2014 and we’re laying the foundation for more long-lasting change with significant investments in renewable energy such as bringing back the SEC. Victoria has set a 75-80 per cent target for greenhouse gas emissions in 2031-2035 (from 2005 levels).

The royal commission’s report released on Tuesday found Anglicare did not conduct a comprehensive internal investigation and did not follow procedures and policies on mandatory reporting to police. It recommended Anglicare consult with Niky and her parents about redress and take immediate action to review its incident and complaint management systems. In a statement, the royal commission said: The Commissioners’ report concludes that Anglicare failed to adopt a trauma-informed approach when dealing with Niky and her family, and failed to address the harm she experienced. Anglicare has already apologised “unreservedly” to Niky, saying: Anglicare acknowledges that its actions in relation to the ‘Niky Case Study’ departed from standard practice and its own policies and procedures. Anglicare recognises that it can and should do better going forward in order to ensure it is able to provide safe, high quality services.

Whether I’m in a small town or a large regional centre, people tell me how hard it is to find a place to live that’s affordable and appropriate to their needs. And they tell me that they’re shocked to see people living in tents in our council parks, to learn of the countless people couch-surfing. This used to be a story of the cities.

The project’s director, Chris Delforce, gained access to the office dressed as a construction worker before being joined by other protesters requesting a meeting with the Australian Pork CEO, Margo Andrae. Delforce said occupying the lobby was a last resort for the group after Andrae refused to respond to footage taken by the group that shows the final moments of pigs in Victoria’s three largest slaughterhouses, which he describes as “agonising”. Protesters from animal advocacy group Farm Transparency Project occupied the lobby at Australian Pork Limited’s Canberra office this morning. Photograph: Farm Transparency Project Delforce said: This same footage has already led to one of Victoria’s three largest pig slaughterhouses closing its doors, after an investigation by government regulator PrimeSafe into our ‘serious and disturbing’ footage led them to order the slaughterhouse to install CCTV in its gas chamber.

The Labor MP and deputy chair of the committee, Julian Hill, asked ASQA how many of about 178,000 international students in the system were interviewed on training outcomes, noting the current regulatory model doesn’t allow for assessment of quality. ASQA CEO Saxon Rice said it wasn’t “easy to answer” because the body focused on risk. We are using our intelligence and data to focus our attention on the providers and the risks that we are assessing … I can’t give you a figure for the number of students. The committee chair and Labor senator Deborah O’Neill said these were “critical numbers that we need”. We need to know how high the risk is, we need to know how many students you’re going to interview, and the sector needs to know that and regularly as well because if they think nothing’s going to happen, the whole system begins to be compromised. Menelaos Koumides, managing director of the Australian Academy of Vocational Education and Trades, said most students would be “delighted” they received an automatic pass and didn’t have to study. Education institutes, the minority of them, have been able to game the system since before ASQA came into being … I’ve walked into a few and you’ll see a teacher on every desk on a computer in an empty classroom … it’s not fit for purpose when it comes to quality, it never was. 3.09am BST Extinction Rebellion promises to make oil and gas feel ‘unwelcome’ Extinction Rebellion South Australia has hit back at comments by the state’s minister of energy and mines, Tom Koutsanton, with the protest group promising to make the oil and gas sector feel “unwelcome”. During a speech to the APPEA conference, Koutsantonis told his audience that the industry was “welcome” in Adelaide, that South Australia was “happy to be a recipient of APPEA’s largesse” and that the state government was “at your disposal”. The Extinction Rebellion South Australia spokesperson, Anna Slynn, said the comments were “dangerous” giving the imminent threat posed by the catastrophic risk of climate change. The world’s climate scientists have been completely clear; there should be no further expansion of oil and gas if we want to avert complete climate catastrophe. Life is in the balance. We will continue to make APPEA feel unwelcome until they leave. Slynn also said the government’s promotion of carbon capture and story was “like putting out a forest fire with a water pistol”. It is extremely costly, and though it might remove a few tonnes of carbon from the air, it will never come close to offsetting the enormous amount released from burning all the gas and oil these companies sell. Updated at 3.15am BST 3.08am BST ‘Many’ providers in training sector shut down, inquiry hears Poor regulation of the VET sector is allowing dodgy providers to game the system, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. About 900 providers in the registered training sector cater to international students. Asked how many had been shut down in recent years, the ASQA CEO, Saxon Rice, said “many” but didn’t provide an exact figure. Guardian Australia put private questions to ASQA asking how many complaints it had received in the past year. It confirmed since July 2022, the body had received 470 complaints and intelligence about training providers. In the same time period, just seven have had their registrations cancelled or suspended. The International Education Association Australia CEO, Phil Honeywood, said “nine times out of 10” cancelled providers took an appeal to VCAT, hiring consultants who were former employees of regulators to make sure the “books are refreshed” and “records are sanitised”. There’s a number of very bad providers that have benefited from this. Menelaos Koumides, managing director of the Australian Academy of Vocational Education and Trades, said the current regulatory system wasn’t fit for purpose and “never was” when it came to quality. We see institutes that we think really should not be here … they’re highly competent in licensing requirements [and they’re] gaming the system. What is severely lacking in this industry which is actually fundamental is to hold RTOs accountable by having independent assessments … and to make these transparent. Students at the moment … have a dependency on agents, [there are] blow-outs in agents commissions … 98% of students are going through agents in international VET … these are all consequences of a regulatory system … that was never fit for purpose.

Brittany Higgins alleged that Lehrmann raped her in parliament house in 2019, an allegation Lehrmann has strenuously and consistently denied. The trial was ultimately aborted, and there is an ongoing inquiry into how the trial was run. Mark Tedeschi, who is acting for the ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, asked Whybrow about his meeting with detective inspector Marcus Boorman. Boorman was “quite distressed” and “thought Mr Lehrmann was innocent”, Tedeschi put to Whybrow. Whybrow said: Correct. Tedeschi said: And then in the context of that conversation, he said to you that if the jury came back with a guilty verdict, that he would resign from the police force. Words to that effect, is my recollection, yes.

The RBA minutes concluded: Members also agreed that further increases in interest rates may still be required, but this would depend on how the economy and inflation evolve. The RBA minutes preceded the federal budget released last week. Economists offered mixed assessments on the budget’s inflationary implications but investors viewed it as neutral. May’s rate rise stunned most economists and the markets, which had noted – as did the RBA board – that consumption in the economy had been weak especially on a per capita basis. Many households were already “experiencing significant financial pressures”, the RBA said. The rolling shift of low fixed rates to higher ones as terms expired would also increase debt repayments. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release wage price index for the March quarter on Wednesday and April jobs figures the following day. The RBA said wages growth was stabilising. “[A] range of indicators suggested that wages growth was running at an annual rate of around 3.5% to 4% in the March quarter,” it said, with the wage price index expected to peak later in 2023 “before easing slightly”. Updated at 2.59am BST 2.50am BST ‘Finely balanced’ RBA rate rise implies some reprieve for borrowers The Reserve Bank‘s surprise decision to lift interest rates last month was “finely balanced” and aimed at diminishing the risks of high inflation becoming entrenched in the economy. Those risks include “strong population and low rental vacancy rates” pushing rental growth “even higher” than the RBA’s main forecast, the bank said in the minutes from its 2 May board meeting that hiked the cash rate another 25 basis points to 3.85%. The meeting weighed up two options: leaving interest rates unchanged for a second consecutive month or increasing it for an 11th time in 12 gatherings. The strong jobs market - with an unemployment rate remaining at near half-century lows of 3.5% and most new positions being full-time roles - was one factor tilting in favour of another rate hike. Weak productivity growth was another. The bank minutes said: [T]he labour market remained tight and ... inflationary pressures were significant. That information point to upside risks to the outlook for inflation. Given “the arguments were finely balanced” as to whether to hike interest rates or not, pundits will likely assume another rate rise in June is unlikely without some surprisingly strong economic data being released. 2.49am BST Dutton defends Stuart Robert’s parliamentary absence Dutton has also defended Stuart Robert’s lack of attendance in parliament since announcing his retirement as the “normal course of events”.

Melissa Donnelly, the national secretary of the union, says “our pay claim is ambitious because it has to be” after a decade of attacks on the public service. To be engaging in genuine negotiations with the government, on pay and conditions, is a far cry from where we were just a year ago.

In the past two days, the committee has heard instances of VET providers working with international education agents to steal students from prestigious public institutions, offer 50% commissions, sell work visas and open “ghost schools” where students don’t attend classes and get handed degrees. The behaviour of that cohort harms students in the sector and the reputation but it’s also going to destroy the social licence of this sector. I couldn’t put it more clearly … if you need more tools, tell the government you need more tools, tell us we can make recommendations. But if we don’t act more urgently, the community will start to turn on this sector … we’ve got to deal with this. Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) CEO Saxon Rice said the body, which regulates the sector, was “acutely aware” poor practices by a “small number of providers” had the capacity to inflict “significant harm on students” and damage reputation. Hill said the conversation over poor practice in the VET market had been had “over and over again” yet no fundamental changes had been made to regulatory frameworks. Year after year, nothing seems to happen … Home Affairs isn’t even enforcing the current rules, let alone new rules … all the evidence we get is you don’t regulate quality, you regulate the ecosystem around the provider, police paperwork, you have no line of sight to the quality of the graduates which are being produced from these institutes.

The premier, Daniel Andrews, today announced a review of the Domestic Building Contracts Act to ensure Victorians building or renovating their homes are better protected. He told reporters: We don’t know what the outcomes of that review will be because it’s a genuine look at each and every line of the act, each and every provision that’s there at the moment. What we can say is that we will introduce a specific offence for builders who take a deposit, and are meant to take out insurance for that customer [but don’t]. Porter Davis went into liquidation in March, leaving about 1,700 homes in Victoria and Queensland unfinished. In Victoria, the building watchdog is currently investigating whether the company broke the law by not taking out domestic building policy insurance for customers when they received their deposits. These homes had not started at the time the company entered liquidation. Andrews said about 560 families lost their deposits due to the failure of the company to take out insurance cover on their behalf: They paid their deposit, they paid their insurance and no money had been forwarded on to the insurer in order to protect them as it should.

Tedeschi said a report had found ACT police were “undercharging” when it came to accusations of sex abuse. Drumgold knew that, he said, and it was part of the reason his relationship with police was poor. Tedeschi said: That’s one aspect, one of three aspects. Step two is the other side of the coin, the attitude of the police to the DPP because they knew that he’d been responsible for this committee being set up and they were resentful of the fact that the DPP was in effect going back and looking at all of their decision making. The third thing is that we anticipate making a submission at the end of the day that what we say is the bizarre approach of the police about whether Mr Lehrmann should be charged is just an example of a general attitude. We want to prove that it’s true they did have this attitude to sex cases generally and this was just a classic example of it. Tedeschi is cross-examining Lehrmann’s lawyer, Steven Whybrow, who said in his opinion it was Drumgold who was hostile to police. Lehrmann has consistently denied allegations that he raped Higgins, a colleague and fellow political staffer, in the office of the then defence industry minister, Linda Reynolds, in March 2019. He pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, denying that any sexual activity had occurred. Updated at 1.29am BST 1.19am BST ‘We cannot do net zero without you,’ SA energy minister says to oil and gas conference The South Australian energy and mining minister, Tom Koutsantonis, has followed federal resources minister Madeleine King’s opening address by telling the Appea conference that it is not possible to decarbonise without the oil and gas industry. You must feel as if you’re under siege, [as if] you’re not welcome, that the risks and endeavour you undertake are not thought of as productive for the country. Nothing could be further from the truth. This industry, as Madeleine said, is a key pillar in our path to decarbonisation. We cannot do it without you. We cannot make the advancements without you. We cannot do net zero without you. We can’t decarbonise our steel industry without this industry. We cannot make electricity without this industry. We cannot transform our economy to net zero without this industry. Those people who are misinformed outside, who attempt to belittle or criticise this industry, do not understand the contribution you make. Koutsantonis says South Australia is committing $600m to developing hydrogen production for export and that investment in gas technology would allow South Australia – and Australia – to “save on the cost of the transition”. This means rather than having to build billions and billions and billions of dollars of renewable resources, we can sweat our gas generators harder. In an extraordinary close, Koutsantonis tells his audience “you are welcome here”: We are thankful you are here. We are happy to a be recipient of Appea’s largesse in the form of coming here more often. The South Australian government is at your disposal, we are here to help and we are here to offer you a pathway to the future. Updated at 1.24am BST 1.16am BST Resources minister says carbon capture and storage ‘necessary’ for wider decarbonisation The federal resources minister, Madeline King, has announced the government will develop a future gas strategy during her opening address at the Appea conference today. King says it was necessary to ensure Australia continue to support “reliable, essential” energy for its domestic and export markets. King also said capture and storage is a “necessary part of a wider decarbonisation effort” with the government having released new acreage for greenhouse storage projects for the “first time in years”. The will is there, the knowhow is there. We want a regulatory system for carbon capture and storage that is robust and responsive and positions Ausstralia’s resources sector to bring new CCS projects on line. But King also said the emissions reductions would only count towards credits under the safeguard mechanism if they are successful or lowering limits below their baseline – “if they are verified and scientifically sound”. Updated at 1.29am BST 1.12am BST ‘There’s policy debates about everything’ at ALP conference: Albanese Albanese goes on that debating policy is what’s supposed to occur at the national conference: I saw the article and it says there will be a policy debate about issues at ALP national conference. Ho-hum. There’s policy debates about everything. That’s why we have an ALP national conference. We are a party that debates our policy live on national TV. Updated at 1.18am BST 1.09am BST PM says government’s position on negative gearing ‘very clear’ despite backbench dissent The PM was also asked about the internal pushback within Labor ranks, which the Nine newspapers are reporting this morning, with backbenchers wanting to see more ambitious housing policies and limit negative gearing. Reporter: The evidence is really clear about needing to make tax changes including to negative gearing. Your MPs have also expressed a hope to revisit negative gearing. Do you take all of that on board? Albanese: The government’s position is very clear and it’s a position for which we received a mandate at the 2022 election and I’m someone who keeps the commitments that we made and our 2022 election commitments we’re busy implementing. (So that’s a no on changes to negative gearing.) Updated at 1.16am BST 12.49am BST Strongest threat to security has been rightwing extremism ‘for some time’: PM Albanese says there is no place in the country for the neo-Nazi demonstrations which took place in Melbourne over the weekend at an anti-immigrations rally: For some time the strongest threat that has been identified for our security has been rightwing extremism. There is no place in Australia for the sort of demonstrations that we’ve seen now on a number of occasions here in Melbourne with people paying tribute to nazism, an evil doctrine that resulted in the mass murder of people on the basis of their religion, on the basis of who they were, on the basis of their sexual preference. The time for tolerance of those matters has long gone. People should have a look at the consequences of that hatred. And it is an ideology of hate. It’s rejected overwhelmingly by all fair-minded Australians and certainly the authorities will continue to monitor and will have every support for any recommendation that is put forward by those authorities to the government. Related: Neo-Nazis clash with police and counter-protesters at anti-immigration rally in Melbourne Updated at 1.02am BST 12.45am BST PM says Greens also blocking medium-density development in Brisbane Albanese says the Greens “can’t have it both ways”, blocking the government’s housing bill at the same time as their housing spokesperson runs petitions against developments in Brisbane. One of the things that I find remarkable is that at the same time as the Greens are blocking additional support for social housing, they’re also running petitions of their housing spokesperson to block any development in medium-density and development of more housing supply in Brisbane. You can’t have it both ways. Updated at 12.51am BST 12.39am BST PM expresses frustration over blocked housing bill The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been speaking in Victoria expressing his frustration at the government’s $10bn housing future fund being blocked in the senate without support from the Greens or the opposition. This is a commonsense position that last week in the Senate we couldn’t even get put to a vote. Updated at 12.46am BST 12.23am BST Sports minister agrees with PM that betting ads are ‘annoying’ Wells – who is also sports minister – agreed with her boss, Anthony Albanese, that she too finds sports betting advertisements “annoying”. However, she isn’t going as far as the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who wants them banned. Wells says she’s deferring to the inquiry looking into the issue: I agree with the prime minister that [they’re] annoying … I listen to national sporting organisations as the sports minister and they have so far been putting constructive submissions into the inquiry … being run by my excellent friend and colleague Peta Murphy. And I trust Peta’s judgment and I wait for the results of her inquiry. Pressed on the urgency of an issue ruining people’s lives, Wells says the Albanese government responded to the urgency by setting up an inquiry in the first year of government to work through the issues. Related: Albanese expresses personal dislike for gambling ads during sporting events as pressure builds for ban Updated at 1.31am BST 12.16am BST Wells outlines measures to ensure care workers’ pay rise passed on in full by providers Circling back to the aged care minister Anika Wells’ interview. The government committed $11bn in the budget to pay for the 15% wage rise for aged care workers, but there’s still questions around how they can ensure providers pass on the wage rise in full to workers. Wells says providers’ attestation in their regular reporting, public data and a schedule of pay that workers can consult will all ensure workers do see the full benefit of that wage rise: What we’re going to do is make providers attest through their regular reporting to us as the government department that they have passed along those wages in full … and if they lie in their attestation that is a criminal offence. Also, that data is going to be published from January 1, so that anybody who has an interest or concern about this – and I know a lot of aged care workers do – will be able to see that data. Finally … we’ve managed to strike a compact with providers and the unions so that we will publish a schedule – because it’s incredibly complex, all the different rates of pay, awards – a schedule that will provide anyone, personal carers, aged care workers in particular, where they can look up the schedule, check that they are being paid what they should be paid under the pay rise. And if not, they could work with their local union to a local resolution and if not, they can escalate it. Updated at 12.27am BST 12.10am BST The employment relations minister, Tony Burke, is not impressed with Peter Dutton’s answer earlier refusing to back the minimum wage being brought in line with inflation. Peter Dutton just refused to back a pay rise for workers on the minimum wage. He spent 10 years as a senior member of a Government that deliberately kept wages low. He hasn’t changed. Labor wants a pay rise for low-paid workers. Dutton wants them to go backwards. @RNBreakfast — Tony Burke (@Tony_Burke) May 15, 2023 Updated at 12.19am BST 11.59pm BST PM says Australia would stay in Commonwealth realm in event of successful republican vote On Fox FM, Anthony Albanese was asked about whether an Australian prime minister will attend another coronation. He said: I don’t know. At some stage I think there will be another vote on the republic at some stage. But the Australian prime minister would still go because we’d still remain part of the Commonwealth … There’s 57 Commonwealth countries, but there’s only 15 now that are part of the realm, that is, have the king as our head of state. So, at some stage – I’m a republican – I think we will make that decision to have an Australian as our head of state, but we’ll stay in the Commonwealth. It’s an important part of our history. On the government’s vaping crackdown, Albanese said: [Vaping] is not a good thing. And the problem with vaping is that it’s a bit of an entry point into then full-on tobacco use. And the problem with vaping as well is that it does of course contain nicotine, many of them, and some of the marketing [contains] things with little dinosaurs and stuff … pretty colours unicorns and all that stuff. … It’s not healthy, not a good thing. Updated at 12.09am BST 11.58pm BST Too soon to predict aged care worker growth, minister says The aged care minister, Anika Wells, has admitted it’s still too early to predict how many new workers will be added to the sector, after a new priority agreement for migrant workers. Under an aged care labour agreement, skilled migrants would gain access to priority visa processing along with a two-year pathway to permanent residency as an incentive for new aged staff. While the first aged care facility in Perth signed on to the scheme, which will net 570 workers in the next five years, Wells it was too soon yet to determine how many new staff would come to the industry nationwide. She told ABC Radio earlier this morning: It’s far too early for us to try and predict how many workers it will yield. We just know this is the number one thing that providers have been asking us to do. It’s taken collaboration, not just across the providers, the unions and the workers who seek to address workforce shortages in aged care but across different portfolios of government. - AAP Updated at 12.06am BST 11.53pm BST PM says voice ‘won’t have an impact on most people’s lives’ but could improve lives of Indigenous Australians Anthony Albanese is doing a round of FM radio interviews in Melbourne, canvassing a lot of personal topics including the coronation, his relationship with Jodie Haydon, his car crash and his glow-up. On the Indigenous voice referendum, Albanese said: I’m worried about the impact on Indigenous people if it doesn’t get up; I’m worried about the way that Australia will be perceived. This is a pretty gracious and generous request. It’s simply asking to be recognised that our history didn’t begin in 1788. We should be proud that our history includes sharing this continent with the world’s oldest continuous culture. And that should be a source of pride. And secondly, we should just listen to people, ask them if we’re going to have an impact on them. That’s just really common courtesy. And importantly you get better results when you involve people in things that impact them. Albanese was asked if he regrets not explaining to people in the suburbs sooner what the voice is about. He said: No, no. The referendum won’t be held for many months. So for a whole lot of your listeners, they will focus from now going forward. We haven’t passed the legislation yet, it’ll be sometime between October and December. And the truth is that overwhelmingly it won’t have an impact on most people’s lives … There’s no right of veto. None of that, that’s all just nonsense. Those [are all] scare campaigns. But it just might make the lives of the most disadvantaged group in Australia better. We still have a 10 year expectancy gap in life. We have the highest incarceration rates. We have gaps in health, housing and education outcomes and we need to do better. Updated at 12.05am BST 11.48pm BST Protesters demonstrate outside oil and gas conference in Adelaide It’s a frosty morning in Adelaide, where the leading lights of Australia’s oil and gas industry are filtering into the Convention Centre for their annual conference. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) represents oil and gas producers in Australia as their peak industry group. Outside, a group of protesters have blocked the entrance to the car park along North Terrace – a continuation of a skirmish that began yesterday. Two protesters, including Deanna “Violet” Coco, were arrested during a protest at the South Australian Drill Core Library where Appea had organised a site visit. Inside the conference centre, the Appea board is holding a private meet-and-greet ahead of opening addresses by Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King, South Australian minister for energy and mining Tom Koutsantonis and Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill. The last oil and gas conference in Adelaide was met with fierce protests over the industry’s role in contributing to climate change, who interrupted a government-led industry roundtable event at the Wine Centre: Related: South Australia won’t supply gas to NSW during shortages, minister warns Updated at 11.54pm BST 11.45pm BST Another drag storytime cancelled over security fears for queer events In Melbourne, another drag storytime event has been cancelled, and one moved online amid increasing security concerns for queer events. At least ten queer events in the past six months have been called off in Melbourne because of far-right activists. Frock Hudson, aka Dean Acuri, was scheduled to perform a drag storytime at Eltham library on Wednesday to celebrate the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT). Over 50 people had registered to go but it has been moved to Zoom after far-right activists repeatedly called and emailed abuse to staff at Yarra Plenty Regional Library. In a statement last night, the Rainbow Community Angels, a new group formed to hold counter-protests at queer events attended by fascists, promised to still hold an event on Wednesday: We very sadly need to let you know that the wonderful Eltham Library have been forced to move their Drag Storytime online due to Victoria Police advice. But we are not going anywhere! We are defending Councils’ important work to promote inclusion, respect and safety for everyone in their communities. Join the angels to celebrate local community inclusion of LGBTIQA+ people, especially young people and kids from rainbow families. Another event scheduled to take place at Woodleigh school on the Peninsula to celebrate IDAHOBIT, with Acuri and drag performer Dolly Diamond, has also been cancelled. Acuri performed at the school for IDAHOBIT in 2022. The school has been contacted for comment. Updated at 11.51pm BST 11.40pm BST The ‘dog whistling’ comments Dutton brushed off Just taking a step back to provide some context on the “dog whistling” comments Dutton brushed off as being from Labor staffers masquerading as journalists. He’s referring to author, columnist and former adviser to Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, Sean Kelly’s commentary in the Nine papers yesterday. Kelly took a look at Dutton’s rhetoric around immigrants in the past (including Dutton’s 2018 gangs comments) in light of his decision to home in on the government’s migration projections of 1.5 million people over the next five years as a key budget response. Kelly wrote: It is always tempting for politicians to follow that old American advice: split the country in two and tear off the bigger half. In certain times, and in relation to certain issues, it is crucial they resist that temptation. Updated at 11.48pm BST 11.29pm BST ‘We should have a broad membership’, Dutton says after question on Moira Deeming Dutton is backing the Liberal party as a broad church; asked about whether there is still a place for people like Moira Deeming after she was expelled from the party room last week, he says: I believe that we should have a broad membership when people express their views, provided they’re not breaching the law. Their views might not be consistent with mine, but I will defend their right to express it. … We’re not cyborgs who have a compulsion to have the same view. Updated at 11.34pm BST 11.20pm BST Nazis in Melbourne ‘scumbags’ and ‘sick individuals’, Dutton says Asked about the Nazis on the steps of parliament house on Spring Street in Melbourne over the weekend who are galvanising around the issue of immigration, Dutton said it “deeply concerns me”. They are scumbags, they are sick individuals, and of all things of all causes to take up – how on earth anybody in their right mind could take up a Nazi cause or wave that flag or salute in a way that a monster taught them to salute is beyond me. Updated at 11.24pm BST 11.16pm BST Dutton also brushed off the idea that he needs to be careful with his language around migration. Now in terms of the dog whistling comments and the rest of it. They are comments made by former Labor staffers who now masquerade as journalists. So I don’t take that as authoritative sort of assessment of my view which I think is quite valid. Related: Why we should avoid an immigration scare campaign – podcast Updated at 11.27pm BST 11.12pm BST Dutton remains uncommitted over raising minimum wage to match inflation Circling back to Dutton’s interview. The opposition leader isn’t weighing in on whether he thinks the minimum wage should be brought in line with inflation (as the unions and government are urging). Instead, he’s insisting: The best thing we can do for Australian families at the moment is reduce their mortgage payments. Updated at 11.19pm BST 11.07pm BST James Packer donates $7m to UNSW Billionaire businessman James Packer has given $7m to UNSW for mental health research and the establishment of a chair in his name on mood disorders. The James Packer Chair in Mood Disorders will lead a new unit at UNSW to conduct research in mental health, with a focus on mood disorders including bipolar disease. Packer said it was “no secret” he had struggled with mental health problems in the past. I am a passionate advocate of finding ways to improve mental health outcomes and I am hopeful that my contribution towards this research will generate positive outcomes in this field and in so doing significantly improve the lives of people battling mental health issues both in Australia and around the world. The gift will also fund a team of researchers to support the chair. Updated at 11.10pm BST 11.02pm BST Dutton points out NAB rate call despite bank describing budget as ‘broadly neutral’ for inflation Dutton continues to accuse the budget of being inflationary, but he doesn’t have his facts quite right. I think some of the economists have pointed out that this is an inflationary budget and that interest rates will stay higher for longer. You have the NAB yesterday saying that they see the prospect of two interest rate rises as a result of his budget. But that’s in fact the opposite of what NAB specifically noted yesterday: Importantly, our rate call is not a response to the recent federal budget, which we judge to be broadly neutral in terms of its effects on inflation and implications for monetary policy. Updated at 11.08pm BST 10.57pm BST Dutton questions whether increase to jobseeker payment is inflationary Dutton says the cost of the government’s jobseeker measures is $4.6bn and the opposition’s policy is “about half of that figure” – in the order of $2.3bn. And the question at the moment is in an inflationary environment, do you want to be pumping $4.6 billion worth of money into the economy. Is that inflationary? Related: Critics of the budget’s cost-of-living measures say they are inflationary – but is this true? | Isaac Gross Updated at 11.06pm BST 10.49pm BST Dutton wants increased work hours for those on jobseeker but holds out on backing payment rise Dutton’s continuing to call on the government to increase the hours someone on jobseeker can work before their payments are reduced. But he won’t say whether the opposition will in exchange back the increase to the jobseeker payment. We’ll have a look at it, at the time. But we want a discussion with the government to properly consider what we’re putting forward. Updated at 11.07pm BST 10.46pm BST The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is discussing his criticisms of the federal budget on ABC Radio. Updated at 10.49pm BST 10.41pm BST Chalmers emphasises ‘responsibilities to each other’ in budget welfare measures The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has defended the budget having measures to support “middle Australia” but emphasised Australians’ responsibilities towards one another. He told ABC’s Q&amp;A program last night: What I wanted to pick up on, respectfully, is I do believe that we do have responsibilities to each other. But there is part of our society who would prefer it if people were left to fend for themselves, if we had this kind of dog-eat-dog world where people who were down on their luck are especially vulnerable for a whole range of different reasons, and we’ve heard some of them tonight. I do really firmly believe that we’ve got responsibilities to each other, and that the basis of social security not just in our country, but in every good country, is that if you are especially vulnerable, or if you need the help of the rest of us, then you should get some help. One of those stories of hardship the treasurer heard was an unemployed mother who broke down in tears explaining she will be forced off the single parent payment when her daughter turns eight in August, leaving her unable to cope with an impending rent increase. As part of the budget, the age limit for the payment will rise to 14, but not until September, leaving this mother without the payment for a month before the new rules kick in. Updated at 10.46pm BST 10.38pm BST Funds for survivors to break shackles of modern slavery Human trafficking support services will get a $24m boost as the government works to crack down on modern slavery, AAP reports. The federal budget allocation will help the services to better meet the needs of victim-survivors by increasing the minimum support time from 45 days to 90, social services minister Amanda Rishworth said. The four-year funding package will also ensure financial support for visa holders who cannot access social welfare payments, and enable check-ups on people who have left the program at three, six and 12 months. The funding provides a pilot program allowing direct referrals to the support program from community providers without engaging federal police will also be created next year. The pilot, to be established next year and last for up to 18 months, is designed to help people come forward, with some victims hesitant to get police involved. It is estimated four out of every five victim-survivors go undetected. Updated at 11.38pm BST 10.33pm BST Good morning! The minutes from the Reserve Bank’s board meeting will be released today, which will offer more insight into the central bank’s decision making behind the last interest rate hike. The most recent May interest rate increase surprised many experts who’d expected the RBA board to keep the cash rate on hold following a pause in April and weakening inflation data for the March quarter. Meanwhile, the government is cracking down on human trafficking, with support services set to receive a $24m boost. Social services minister Amanda Rishworth said the federal budget allocation will help the services to better meet the needs of victim-survivors by increasing the minimum support time from 45 days to 90. Speaking to the ABC’s Q&amp;A program last night, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, insisted there is a lot in the budget for middle Australia but has pressed the point that Australians do have responsibilities towards each other. In Victoria, the Greens are pushing to expand the state’s anti-vilification laws following recent ugly clashes over transgender and immigration rights. The Greens will introduce a bill to state parliament this week to change the laws to cover vilification on the basis of sexuality and gender. Let’s get into it!</body>

    <head>Under the Fig Trees review – beguiling battle of the sexes in Tunisian fields</head>
    <body>French-Tunisian documentary maker Erige Sehiri makes a watchable fiction feature with this shrewd, sympathetic ensemble study, which takes place as promised in the title: over a single working day in a fig tree orchard in Kesra, north-western Tunisia. Every day a truck comes to pick up a crowd of people doing cash-in-hand work picking the fruit: largely women, young and old, and some men. The long working day unfolds as the shadows shorten, then lengthen and friendships, enmities, generational and political disputes and embryonic and failed love affairs are revealed to us. The movie is largely improvised and Sehiri appears often to have set up specific situations for two or three characters to work around, so there are some slightly protracted, shapeless, acting-class improv conversations and arguments, and even some improv fighting; sometimes the film loses its narrative traction. But the loose style gives the film an easy and attractive swing and there are times when it looks very real: the moment when the dilapidated tailgate falls off the back of the truck was surely authentic. The key relationship is that between Fidé (Fidé Fdhili) a young female worker and her boss. Instead of clambering into the back of the truck with all the others she gets to ride up front with him and doesn’t care about the gossip. With that single gesture, Sehiri encapsulates the sexual politics: women are compelled to choose between sisterly solidarity and what compromised prestige and advantage they can gain through a relationship with a man. Sehiri was reportedly inspired by the light-hearted “Marivaudage”, the bantering dialogue found in the work of 18th-century author Pierre de Marivaux, an inspiration she shares with another French-Tunisian director, Abdellatif Kechiche, whose 2003 film Games of Love and Chance is about teenagers rehearsing Marivaux’s play of the same name. • Under the Fig Trees is released on 19 May in UK and Irish cinemas.</body>

    <head>The best recent crime and thriller writing – review roundup</head>
    <body>Wilder Harlow is a weird, lonely teenager when his warring parents bring him to a New England seaside town for the summer. There, he meets the best friends he will ever have, Harper and Nat; they spend their days swimming and boating, and talking about the mysterious Dagger Man who haunts the bedrooms of the town’s children at night. But as they swim, and fall in love, and dare one another, they discover a horror far worse than the Dagger Man’s shadowy presence – a murder that will follow Wilder for decades. “There’s a look in her eye like she knows, somewhere deep down, that her time will be cut short,” he says later. “It’s strangely common, I have found, with photographs of the dead. It’s there in their faces – what’s to come. But of course that can’t be true. It’s us who are left behind who see it. Who put it there.” Looking Glass Sound (Viper), the latest thriller from The Last House on Needless Street author Catriona Ward, opens as a coming-of-age story told through Wilder’s unpublished memoir of his childhood. But it becomes something much deeper and stranger when we meet Wilder in adulthood and learn about stories layered on top of stories, horrors piled on horrors. Eerie and disturbing, it is another darkly atmospheric slice of the literary horror/thriller genre that Ward is making her own. Holly Watt: ‘clever, intriguing, fast-moving writing’. Photograph: Lucy Johnston Will Dean’s The Last Thing to Burn is one of the most terrifying thrillers I’ve read in years, so I couldn’t wait to get my hands on his latest, The Last Passenger (Hodder &amp; Stoughton). The premise is excellent: Caz and her boyfriend, Pete, board a luxury ocean liner for a trip across the Atlantic to New York. But when Caz wakes up the next morning, the huge vessel is entirely empty. “Not a single human being on any of the windswept decks or promenades,” she says. “Nobody waiting by the lifeboats. The breeze blows my hair over my face and I start to panic. It’s as if I’m trapped on a runaway train. No, this is worse. The RMS Atlantica is steaming out into the ocean and I am the only person on board.” Supernatural explanations aside, this seems an impossible trick for a writer to pull off satisfactorily, but Dean, who also writes the excellent Tuva Moodyson crime series, makes it work. I won’t tell you how, because it would spoil this mile-a-minute, bite-your-nails-to-the-quick ride of a novel, but I will tell you to trust this writer, because I guarantee you’ll enjoy where he takes you. Extra kudos for the final twist, which brought me great pleasure. Fans of intelligent, heart-stopping thrillers should pick up the latest in the Casey Benedict series from Holly Watt, The End of the Game (Raven Books). Watt is an investigative journalist who worked on stories including MPs’ expenses and the Panama Papers, and her experience makes her heroine Casey, top reporter at the London Post, leap off the page. This time round, Casey is at the races when she sees a man being chased and steps in to save his life. She then finds herself investigating a sophisticated gambling operation that stretches around the world. This is clever, intriguing, fast-moving writing, with a protagonist who won’t let go of a story. The final chase scene, involving a chair lift across snowy mountains, is one of the best I’ve read. Emma starts hearing strange noises at night; sees a figure in her bedroom; finds the internet down and the phone lines cut Taylor Adams is having a lot of fun in The Last Word (Hodder &amp; Stoughton), in which Emma, “slumming on Amazon’s bargain and free listings”, discovers it was a very bad idea to give the latest cheap ebook she’s bought, schlock horror Murder Mountain by HG Kane, a one-star review. Kane responds, asking her to take it down: “I spent six months writing Murder Mountain. It took you just a few seconds to type that hateful review and tarnish all my hard work.” House-sitting on a remote beach on the Washington coast, Emma refuses. Then, on her screen, “another message from the author – now tinged with menace. ‘I won’t ask you again.’” Emma starts hearing strange noises at night; sees a figure in her bedroom; finds the internet down and the phone lines cut. It’s not hard to guess where this is going, but Adams, author of No Exit, is great on building suspense as Emma – a troubled, tough and intriguing protagonist – tries to batten down the hatches in her lonely hideaway. Definitely five stars (not that I’d dare to give it any less). • To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply</body>

    <head>Reading ability of children in England scores well in global survey</head>
    <body>England’s nine and 10-year-olds have taken fourth place in a major international literacy study comparing the reading ability of children of the same age in 43 different countries, up from joint eighth place last time assessments were carried out. The results saw English pupils leapfrog those in high-performing countries like Finland and Poland in the rankings, while pupils in Singapore topped the league table, followed by Hong Kong in second place and Russia coming in third. Despite the improvement in ranking, England’s score remained virtually unchanged since the last round of assessments in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls), which took place in 2016, with its average actually dropping marginally from 559 to 558. Other countries, however, saw their scores fall significantly over a period in which there was widespread disruption to education due to the Covid pandemic. Only 11 of the 43 countries that tested pupils of the same age in Pirls 2021 managed to avoid significant declines, including England. Interactive Finland’s score went down from 566 in 2016 to 549, while Poland’s dropped from 565 to 549, still well above the international average of 520 and the European average of 524. At the top of the table Singapore achieved an average score of 587, Hong Kong 573 and Russia 567. Tuesday’s results were welcomed by Rishi Sunak, who said: “Driving up literacy rates is central to our plan to grow the economy, one of my five key priorities, so it’s great to see England move up to fourth in the international rankings for reading.” The government also highlighted a narrowing in the attainment gap between highest and lowest performing pupils, and between boys and girls, though this appeared to be mainly down to a slight fall in girls’ average scores. “While there is always more progress to be made, pupils and teachers across the country should be incredibly proud of this achievement today,” said the prime minister. The schools minister, Nick Gibb, said England’s success follows the introduction of the phonics screening check in 2012 and in 2018 the English hubs programme, a scheme designed to develop expertise in teaching reading in schools. Asked about the decline in girls’ reading scores, Gibb said it was minimal. In England, girls had an average score of 562, compared with the boys’ average of 553, compared with 566 for girls and 551 for boys in 2016. Dr Dirk Hastedt, the executive director of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which administers Pirls, said the latest results reflected England’s improved performance in reading since 2006. “Overall, we have to admit that teachers in England obviously did a good job despite Covid,” said Hastedt. “They were able to teach students so that they were among the countries without losses. That’s a significant achievement, so we can definitely congratulate teachers and schools for the amazing job they did during Covid-19.” Jon Andrews, head of analysis at the Education Policy Institute, said: “Today’s Pirls results resonate with our own findings that outcomes in reading have been recovered to their pre-pandemic levels. However, our analysis also suggests that in maths, primary school pupils remain around one and a half months behind pre-pandemic norms in their learning.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “This is a badly needed piece of good news for an education system that feels beleaguered. These excellent results in reading standards of nine-10-year-olds are testament to the hard work, skill and dedication of primary school teachers and leaders.”</body>

    <head>Victorian students’ reading scores went backwards amid long remote learning period, international study shows</head>
    <body>Victorian students were the only Australian cohort to go backwards in a prestigious international reading exam, after experiencing the longest periods of remote learning in the nation. The 2021 progress in international reading literacy study (Pirls) test, released on Tuesday, measured trends in year 4 students’ reading literacy across 57 nations. Related: ‘Free’ public education costs as much as $100,000 in parts of Australia, report finds It found Australia’s overall results remained relatively stable compared with the most recent survey in 2016, ranking 11th overall, while Victoria was a notable outlier, with the average student score falling 14 points. Nevertheless, Victorian students still achieved higher average scores than all Australian jurisdictions except the ACT. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds, in remote areas and First Nations students also lagged behind the national average, with the gap failing to narrow since Australia first participated in the exam in 2011, while female students and those who came from households with large book collections outperformed their peers. The Pirls national project manager for Australia, Kylie Hillman, said Victoria’s overall score had dropped as had the proportion of higher performing students in the state. But she said the number of students achieving the national proficient standard had remained stable. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Victorian students spent the longest periods of time in remote learning during the pandemic and had only recently returned to face-to-face learning at the time of the 2021 Pirls assessment,” she said. Just under half of Australian students spent eight weeks or more in remote learning during the pandemic, compared with 100% of Victorian students. Hillman said that “encouragingly”, the reading results for the same cohort of Victorian students when they took Naplan in 2022 were similar to the results for the previous cohort in 2021. Australia’s average score in 2021 was 540 points, just shy of the “high” international benchmark of 550 points and similar to 2016 (544 points) and 2011 (527 points). Interactive *Countries and educational systems conducted the assessment one year later than originally scheduled ** Test was taken by year 5 students Students scored higher on average than nine- and 10-year-olds in 28 other participating countries and jurisdictions, including New Zealand, and ranked 11th overall. Singapore achieved the highest average score (587), followed by Hong Kong, (573), the Russian Federation (567) and England (558) – all above the high benchmark. One in every three students in Singapore reached the advanced benchmark – the highest level of reading comprehension - and just 3% were at the low benchmark. Related: Central Australian schools get record federal funding, as Labor aims to halt public education flight Comparatively, one in five Australian year 4 students were reading at or below the low benchmark. And while the average achievement of Australian students was above the proficient standard of reading, the results found that large achievement gaps for First Nations students and students studying remotely or from low socioeconomic backgrounds have not shifted. Students who identified as having a First Nations background scored 491 points on average, more than 50 points below students from other backgrounds and close to the “low” benchmark of comprehension. Similarly, Australian students in more disadvantaged schools scored 508 points on average, more than 50 points lower than students in more affluent schools (562 points) and major cities (546). Students in remote areas scored lowest, at 485 points, just shy of the low benchmark. “Students in year 4 are at a key transition point in their schooling, moving from ‘learning to read’ to ‘reading to learn’. “Support for students who find reading challenging is essential to prevent them falling behind in other learning areas, as more of their schooling draws on their reading skills.” Related: Warning decline in Australia’s adult literacy being hidden by lack of data Nationally, eight in 10 Australian students met the proficient standard, including 14% who were at the advanced benchmark and 34% who reached the high benchmark. Students in the Australian Capital Territory scored higher on average than all other jurisdictions at 560 points, and also had the highest proportion of students at the advanced benchmark (19%) after halving the proportion of children at the lowest reading level since the 2016 survey. It was followed by Victoria (545), New South Wales (541) and Queensland (540). The Northern Territory ranked at the bottom of the list, with an average score of 516. Hillman said the ACT’s success warranted further investigation to improve the “really concerning” Australian cohort struggling to reach proficient standards. “The goal is every child is able to make the most of their opportunities and achieve as best as they can … we have to do whatever we can to make that possible for them.” The test found girls performed significantly better than boys in 38 of the participating nations, including Australia, where 84% met or exceeded the proficient reading standard, compared with 77% of boys. How many books students had in the home and how much they enjoyed reading also played a key factor in score outcomes. Year 4 students with many books in the home [a measure of economic mobility] were more likely to be in the high benchmark, scoring 566 points on average compared with those with a few books in the home, who scored an average of 506 points. The 29% of year 4 students who very much liked reading scored significantly higher than the quarter who didn’t, as did students who somewhat enjoyed it.</body>

    <head>UK schools minister promises to review Sats paper that left pupils ‘in tears’</head>
    <body>The schools minister, Nick Gibb, has promised to review a controversial Sats paper, which is said to have left some pupils “in tears”, after teachers and parents expressed widespread concern about the difficulty of the test. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said the English paper, which was taken by 10 and 11-year-olds in year 6 last Wednesday, was so difficult that teachers had struggled to understand the questions. The minister said he had not yet seen the paper, but acknowledged the concern expressed by schools and said he would look at it when it becomes available next week once the assessment window is over. Gibb, who was speaking to reporters during a school visit, said the papers were carefully checked to ensure they were age appropriate and designed to test a range of abilities, but he acknowledged the tests should not be “too hard” for children. Sats papers are compiled and delivered by the Standards and Testing Agency, an executive agency that works independently from the Department for Education (DfE). The difficulty of the reading paper prompted a flurry of complaints online from parents and teachers with one person saying on Mumsnet that her daughter found the paper “awful”. Kerry Forrester, a headteacher at a Cheshire primary school, wrote to her local MP expressing concern about the “negative impact” on the “mental health and wellbeing” of her pupils. On Friday, the DfE appeared to defend the difficulty of the tests saying they were intended to be challenging. On Monday, however, Gibb said: “I will certainly look at this, because I know that there has been concern expressed by some schools. “They do have to test a range of ability to make sure we can show what proportion of children are exceeding the standards and so on. But we don’t want these tests to be too hard for children. That’s not the purpose. “The purpose is to test the range of ability and the Standards and Testing Agency is charged with making sure that these tests are appropriate for this age group.” The National Education Union (NEU) described the paper as a “punishing experience” for staff and pupils. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the union, said: “This is not a system that is concerned about children and their learning. “There are better ways of assessing pupils. There are better forms of school accountability. It is about time the government started looking at them.”</body>

    <head>UK payroll numbers fall as unemployment rate rises to 3.9%</head>
    <body>The number of workers on UK employers’ payrolls dropped for the first time in two years last month amid signs that the flatlining economy has started to take a toll of Britain’s labour market. Fresh figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a 136,000 fall in employees between March and April – the first reduction since February 2021. Although the ONS said the data was provisional, the numbers on payrolls provide the most timely guide to the state of the jobs market and will be seen as evidence of a cooling in demand for labour. Despite April’s fall, payrolls are more than 800,000 higher than they were in February 2020, the month before the UK went into its first Covid-19 lockdown. Related: UK interest rate rises are taking the labour market off the boil The official figures showed employment and unemployment up in the first three months of 2023. With the cost of living crisis hitting household budgets, there was a record flow of people out of inactivity and into work. The unemployment rate rose unexpectedly to 3.9% from 3.8%. Job vacancies fell by 55,000 to just over 1m in the three months ending in April, the 10th consecutive quarterly drop. The number of people inactive as a result of long-term sickness reached a fresh record of 2.55 million. Interactive The ONS director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, said: “Employment and unemployment both rose again in the first three months of 2023, driven in particular by men. This means the number of those neither working nor looking for work continues to fall, although the number of people not working due to long-term sickness rose again, to a new record.” Despite the highest pay growth in the public sector for two decades, the ONS said workers in public and private sectors were becoming worse off because prices were rising faster than wages. Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 7.0% and for the public sector was 5.6% in January to March, but the cost of living rose by 10.1% in the year to March. Interactive Meanwhile, the number of days lost through strikes rose from 332,000 in February to 556,000 in March, with 80% of the total the result of action in the health and education sectors. Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “A combination of high costs and cash-strapped consumers is now causing some businesses to hesitate before hiring, uncertain as to what the future holds.” Chris Thomas, the head of the Commission on Health and Prosperity at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, said: “More people are now out of work due to ill-health than any other time since records began. This is a damning indictment of this government’s record on our health. Long-term sickness is fatally undermining our economy and holding back people’s ability to live long, happy and prosperous lives.” Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the exchequer, said it was “encouraging” that the unemployment rate remained low at 3.9%, despite the 0.1-point rise in the three months to March.</body>

    <head>Ja Morant, masculinity and the misguided way of the gun</head>
    <body>I will get to the messy tale of Ja Morant shortly. But first, a personal history. I grew up in South Dallas. Our house was repeatedly broken into. Drive-bys were a regular occurrence. I was jumped often, walking to and from school. Escaping that level of purgatory for the creature comforts of middle-America capitalism was no small feat. Many of my friends were involved in gangs. I never joined in – I was too scared. My pops kept me off the streets as best he could, while protecting himself and his family from the terrors outside our door. He had multiple guns. A Glock rested inside his bedside dresser. A shotgun sat on top of a stack of Maxim magazines at the top of the closet. Most people in my neighborhood had firearms: many on the left act like the only people who are pro-gun in the US are backwoods rednecks preparing for a race war. But Black and brown communities have plenty of gun rights advocates too. They aren’t members of the NRA and don’t march in Maga hats to defend gun laws after school shootings but they exist. As an adult still living in the ‘hood in Texas, albeit a gentrified one, I still keep a shotgun in my closet. Growing up in poverty is a disease that you never quite cure. I have only touched my gun once – when I moved home. I hope that remains the case. I do not take my gun out. And if I did, it wouldn’t be on Instagram Live, something Morant, a fabulously talented young NBA player, has done … twice. The latest incident – and there have been plenty of disturbing stories around Morant – came on Sunday when a video emerged of him riding in a car with friends, rapping along to NBA YoungBoy. So far, so innocent. But at one point, Morant is seen holding a gun. Soon afterwards, the Memphis Grizzlies announced they had suspended Morant from all basketball-related activities. His lucrative sponsorship deals, including one with Nike, could be in jeopardy and his previous suspension for another gun-related incident in March may well have cost him a $40m payday. There could be a case he violated the NBA’s CBA, which prohibits players from possessing a firearm “of any kind” in numerous settings. It also states that players must notify their teams about firearms and provide proof of registration, giving NBA commissioner Adam Silver authority to fine and suspend players for “conduct detrimental to the Association.” Related: LeBron James shows wannabe gangster Ja Morant that a gun doesn’t make you great | Andrew Lawrence But as Tennessee is an open-carry state, Morant did not do anything illegal according to state law. And many have pointed out, correctly, the hypocrisy of the rightwing media bashing Morant while failing to condemn white Republicans displaying their firearms in public (sometimes with children in tow). Clearly, the idea of a Black man owning or brandishing a gun, no matter the setting or state, is a scary idea to everyone, regardless of political affiliation. There are other reasons to cut Morant some slack. In some of the reports of his behavior, alcohol abuse has been mentioned. In an ESPN interview in March with Jalen Rose, which now looks like a PR stunt, he said he deals with anxiety and stress. Essentially, he linked his recent behavior with these mental and emotional issues. I felt empathy for Morant as I, too, deal with extreme anxiety and depression. I’m on medication, thankfully, as mental issues are genetically linked to both sides of my family history. Next month will be a year of sobriety. I had to cut alcohol out of my life in order to regain control over my vices and addictions. It would be understandable if Morant, too, struggles with anxiety. Sure, he has millions of dollars but he also has intense media scrutiny as arguably the best young American player in a league where many of the biggest stars are now from outside the States (only one player in this year’s All-NBA First Team is from the US). I’m also aware of where Morant came from. He grew up in a stable, two-parent home in Sumter, South Carolina: his father is a former basketball player who taught his son the game. He is honored to have his father cheer for him from floor seats at every home game. I know how meaningful that can be, as my dad watches every episode of the Knicks podcast I co-host. He also reads every single NBA article I write. But Sumter, like South Dallas, isn’t exactly Bel Air. Its violent crime rate is twice the national average, and the median household income is less than two-thirds of the US median. Thankfully Morant stayed out of violence and away from the legal system growing up and was eventually picked No 3 overall by the Grizzlies in the 2019 draft. Having said all this, it’s obvious that Morant is acting out. You may even say that, at 23, he’s acting his age. He had already been suspended by the NBA for flashing a gun on Instagram Live and he soon chose to do so again. But there are many, many NBA players who grew up in tougher circumstances than Morant – LeBron James among them – and have stayed well clear of any trouble. Like many young people in the US, Morant connects being armed with being tough. Especially when you haven’t seen the effects of what a gun can do in person, towards friends and even enemies: it becomes merely a symbol rather than a weapon. If someone were to run up on Morant, he would surely have an army of friends and hanger-ons to defend him. He wouldn’t even have to squeeze the trigger, if it came to that. That’s the “luxury” of having people who will ride for you. But Morant is putting himself and those around him in danger. Some of the friends I grew up with are dead from gang violence. Others are still in the lifestyle they started as 17-year-olds, rotting away in cyclical violence 20 years later. Many are hooked on drugs and broke. Some made it out, but not many. I count my blessings to be one of them. The image Morant is projecting to his followers and fans is of someone on the edge of violence. It’s an image that doesn’t come from scars of past self-defense. He is not continuing a legacy of gang-banging. There’s nothing illegal about enjoying a night out with friends at the strip club or riding around with your buddies in a car with a gun in an open-carry state. But in the context of his behavior in recent months, it’s not about what is or isn’t legal. It’s about optics. Especially the optics Morant propagates of masculinity, toughness, and gun use. And what those watching, especially the youngest and most vulnerable of them, are seeing.</body>

    <head>Lack of affordable housing is harming regional Australia, Anglicare chief says</head>
    <body>The $40-a-fortnight boost to the jobseeker payment increases the number of affordable rentals across all of Australia from just four rooms in share houses to five. That’s according to the Anglicare rental affordability snapshot, the Anglicare chief executive, Kasy Chambers, told the National Press Club on Tuesday. The 2023 snapshot, released before the federal budget last month, analysed 46,000 rental properties across Australia, based on whether rent would cost more than 30% of the household budget for various low-income households. Chambers was speaking as part of a panel on housing affordability in regional Australia. She said when Anglicare began its rental affordability snapshot 10 years ago, there was a belief that regional areas were more affordable. Related: Jenai quit her Melbourne flat because the mould was so bad – then it was relisted for $60 a week more “That wasn’t the truth then and it certainly isn’t now,” she said. Some regions are worse off than others: in central Queensland, she said, only nine of the 397 rental listings analysed in the report were affordable for a couple with two children who both lived on jobseeker, and on the New South Wales north coast, only 8% of rental listings were affordable for a couple who had two children and both worked full-time in minimum-wage jobs. “We do not see affordable housing in regions any more,” she said. “You’re in effect buying the number of available jobs through the price of your rent or mortgage.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Chambers said skyrocketing rents in regional areas were having flow-on effects on other services such as aged care, as pensioners living in private rentals decided to move into residential aged care facilities earlier than they otherwise might because they cannot keep pace with rent. She called for a return to fully publicly funded social and affordable housing, rather than relying on the private sector and schemes such as negative gearing, capital gains tax concessions and commonwealth rent assistance. “We now spend more commonwealth dollars per capita on those three payments than we ever did on housing, and yet housing affordability has never been lower,” she said. “Anyone can see that this approach is failing.” Anna Neelagama, the chief executive of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, and the independent MP for Indi, Helen Haines, were also on the panel. Neelagama said house prices and rental supply issues in regional Australia had cooled since 2021 and were now back at pre-pandemic levels, but that had not resulted in an increase in the number of affordable rentals available. She suggested the federal government use some of the $60m allocated under the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to pay local governments to write to ratepayers in an effort to get “empty or latent homes” back in the permanent rental pool. “The Eurobodalla shire on the south coast did this and successfully got 18 new properties back into their rental pool,” she said. Neelagama also suggested an audit of land and houses owned by state and territory governments, to free up any police or teachers’ houses that were standing empty and government-owned land which was being land-banked and not developed. She suggested Australia should also look at prefabricated or modular homes – “any homes we can get in the ground quickly” – as a way to house key workers. Haines said there had been a 67% increase in the number of people homeless in Wangaratta, a regional Victorian service town at the heart of her electorate, since 2016. She described meeting a man she called Richard who was using the shower block at a public park and lives in a tent after a relationship breakdown and mental health challenges. He is a qualified chef in a region that relies on tourism and where hospitality workers are in high demand, but his housing situation has made finding a job “completely impossible”. “The lack of affordable housing in Indi has consequential flow-on economic impacts,” Haines said. “Whenever I speak to a business owner, they tell me they’re unable to fill job vacancies because people cannot find anywhere to live.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community</body>

    <head>Leicestershire offer parable for English cricket: teams should serve, not just sell</head>
    <body>The fourth morning at Grace Road dawns brightly and the game is moving at a frightening pace. Leicestershire, following on, are 16 without loss. The Sussex fielders are bounding and skipping across the turf in short, jerky movements. The seamer Brad Currie walks back to his mark in a droll, Charlie Chaplin-style double-step. The commentators are talking in weird electronic blips. At this point you realise the live stream is not working. Which is obviously something that could happen to anybody. Certainly it would be premature to draw any link between Leicestershire’s apparent inability to operate a simple two-camera feed and the fact that the club have finished bottom of the County Championship in eight of the past 14 seasons, and failed to win a single red-ball game in 2022. Eventually the technical gremlins are sorted, in which time the home team have lost one of their openers and are sliding towards a meek defeat. Related: Ben Stokes a fitness doubt for England’s first Test of summer against Ireland At which point something curious happens. The promising opener Rishi Patel goes on a spirited counter-attack, and with the all-rounder Wiaan Mulder in support Leicestershire bat out the day for a stirring draw. Steve Smith, here for a pre-Ashes hit, has just three runs and one risible over of leg-spin to show for his week’s work. And who says Leicestershire never do their bit for England? So continues one of the early summer’s more quietly uplifting stories. Six rounds in, the championship’s perennial punchline are still unbeaten. Last month they won at Headingley for the first time in 113 years. A first promotion in more than two decades is a tantalising possibility. And perhaps the case of Leicestershire offers both a parable and a warning for English cricket, at a time when the very principles of the sport are being shuffled beneath our feet. What else could Leicestershire achieve if the game didn’t keep trying to wipe them off the map? Every so often you hear notables from within the game wondering aloud about whether we really need 18 counties. Most of the time they’re too polite to name names, but let’s be real: they’re talking about Leicestershire. A club that hasn’t played in the top division since 2003. No Indian conglomerate or private equity fund is queueing up to purchase it. And so when the England and Wales Cricket Board debates the merits of a 12-team Premier League or a reduction in red-ball cricket, the unspoken subtext is that clubs such as Leicestershire are essentially a drag on the whole enterprise. What’s the point of you? Why should the rest of us continue to bear your impoverished existence? Around the start of the pandemic, a new chief executive called Sean Jarvis set about trying to answer this question. Jarvis is a Leicester native who has spent most of his career working in football, and occasionally says things such as “we need to establish ourselves as one of the leading clubs in Cricket PLC”. And yet for all the jargon there is also the bones of a plan. Membership and corporate bookings are up. Last year the club achieved record turnover despite the late cancellation of a Paloma Faith concert. But revenue is not an end in itself. Last summer Leicestershire halved their prices to help fans who were struggling financially. Several times a season the club hand out free tickets to local residents. In March they announced plans to redevelop Grace Road, with space for retail units and community housing, healthcare provision and assisted living for the elderly. Jarvis talks a lot about “identity” and on some level he appears to grasp what English cricket as a whole has largely forgotten: that any sporting team worth its space must exist not merely to sell, but to serve. Leicestershire have reduced prices and handed out free tickets to get local fans involved. Photograph: John Mallett/ProSports/Shutterstock Whatever you thought of the Hundred when it arrived, there was at least a tangible rationale to it. You build it up. It makes money. The money funds everything else. Fine. But once you sell it off that rationale disappears in an instant. The one-off windfall will quickly vanish into a million sinkholes – bonuses, handouts, capital expenditure projects – and then what? Back where you started, but on the outside looking in, and with nothing left to sell. And Leicestershire, like their live feed, eventually splutter and die. Keep the Hundred in-house, and the entity remains whole. Perhaps Leicestershire do not get promoted. Perhaps they end up becoming a de facto feeder team to the Trent Rockets. But even here there is an ecosystem with a place for them, where everyone is linked and nobody gets forgotten. You think the Delhi Capitals are going to build your gran a house? You think the benign hand of the market is going to halve ticket prices in a cost of living crisis? For all its flaws and foibles, Leicestershire CC is a real thing. It exists, in a way the Trent Entertainment Vehicle does not. It has a mission that goes beyond simply shaking people down for whatever they can pay. It produces cricketers: the bewilderingly exciting leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed the latest. A wild thought: maybe it might achieve even more if the people at the top of the game didn’t keep trying to wipe it off the map. What do we want sport to be? A pure consumer good, escapism on demand, a direct debit that you forget to cancel? Or can it be something more? Can it bring people together, provide a sense of pride and ownership, give people a stake in their town and their town a stake in something larger? You don’t have to be a Leicestershire fan, or even like cricket very much at all, to recognise that this is a vision of sport worth fighting for.</body>

    <head>Could handbags be the haute couture solution to Florida’s python problem?</head>
    <body>The fight to eradicate Burmese pythons from the Florida Everglades has intertwined with New York’s haute fashion scene in a project launched by a group of environmental activists who have already experienced success working with the skins of other invasive species. The Tampa-based team, founded by a group of former college friends with a passion for scuba diving, cut their teeth transforming the skins of non-native lionfish off the US south-east coast and Caribbean Sea into high-end sneakers in partnership with the Italian shoemaker P448. Related: Florida researchers capture invasive pythons by attaching GPS collars to prey But with up to an estimated 150,000 unwanted pythons slithering through the Everglades, devouring ever greater numbers of native wildlife from white-tailed deer to rabbits and rats, according to a recent US Geological Survey (USGS) report, the new venture converting snake skins into designer handbags presents a more substantial challenge. “Pythons in the Everglades is such a colossal problem, you have to corral so many resources, so much energy, and so many interests to try to tackle it,” said Aarav Chavda, co-founder of the operation the friends have called Inversa Leathers. “We know we’re not riding in with a silver bullet. It’s a years-long process to combat it, and develop better tools. But the really great thing about this is you have very invested and interested consumers pushing on this problem. “It brings a lot more attention, resources, capacity, in all walks along the way.” The process starts with hunters in the Everglades tracking, trapping and humanely killing pythons, which can grow up to 20ft in length. Inversa processes and tans the skins, which Piper &amp; Skye, a New York accessory brand known for environmental ethics as well as its upmarket leather products, makes into a range of colorful handbags. Those at the top of the range go for almost $1,000. The project utilizes a bounty system similar to the one Inversa operates to incentivize low-income fishers in the Caribbean to whom coral-destroying lionfish are otherwise worthless. “How a product is made, what it’s made of, and the people who make it are just as important as the product itself,” said Joanna MacDonald, creative director of Piper &amp; Skye. Chavda said he expected the number of pythons caught and processed this way to grow as consumers become aware of the story behind the handbags. Wildlife authorities in Florida, in conjunction with university researchers and environmental groups, have employed a variety of tactics in recent years to try to get a handle on the python problem, which the USGS has described as “one of the most intractable” invasive species challenges in the world. The Florida fish and wildlife commission (FWC) runs an annual 10-day python challenge with a $10,000 prize for the most prolific hunter. The 2022 winner caught 28 pythons. Previous efforts have included training a python-sniffing dog, who wilted in the south Florida heat, and fitting amorous male snakes with electronic trackers to lead hunters to females. And in 2017, two renowned snake catchers from India’s mountain-dwelling Irula tribe bagged only 33 pythons after chanting across the Everglades for two months. But pythons, the new apex predator of the Florida swamplands after usurping the native American alligator, continue to reign supreme. The USGS survey earlier this year showed the python population, which experts think began with pet owners releasing unwanted reptiles in the 1980s, is spreading further and faster than ever before. To Chavda and his team, that lends urgency to their project. “Pythons will chase anything and they’re really bad,” he said. “The Everglades used to be abounded with sound and energy and life, there used to be songbirds, and marsh hares, and rabbits and otters, just tons of native life. Now it’s just silent and totally dead. “What we’re trying to do is just bring attention, focus and the power of the consumer, probably the most powerful interest group on the planet, and focus that all on a very specific problem.”</body>

    <head>Tory populists have a real enemy in their sights – they’re gunning for the Tory realists</head>
    <body>It’s been almost six months now since the last Tory leadership contest. So perhaps it was inevitable that another one would be along soon. No, not another attempted Boris Johnson comeback, despite the best efforts of nostalgic grassroots Tories gathering for a rally last weekend in Bournemouth. The contest much of the cabinet is now less than subtly limbering up for is the one that would follow defeat at the next election, and which some Tories think could yet provoke a historic split in the party. The row currently engulfing Rishi Sunak’s government over immigration can only be properly understood in the context of the electorate some expect to be facing before too long; not the country at large so much as the sliver of it represented by card-carrying Conservative members, many still resentful about having first Johnson and then Liz Truss taken away from them. For an idea of what those theoretical future hustings might sound like, look to this week’s National Conservatism conference, a gathering of British and American culture warriors brought together by a US thinktank and positioned as a more genteel version of the Republican Tea Party rallies. The speech by the home secretary, Suella Braverman, set the tone for a movement billed as championing the muscular nation state and traditional nuclear family against the dreaded forces of wokery. Braverman wants it known that she and she alone can give the angriest part of the Tory base what it wants: to yank up the immigration drawbridge at all costs, even if that means leaving farmers’ crops rotting in the fields or decimating universities’ income from foreign students. Kemi Badenoch, the next most blatant frontrunner in the next leadership contest, isn’t due to speak – she’s in Switzerland for trade talks – but her representative on Earth, Michael Gove, will be there and can doubtless fill her in. Other promised speakers include notorious historian David Starkey, last seen on GB News before the coronation accusing Rishi Sunak of not being “fully grounded in our culture”; deputy party chairman Lee “bring back the death penalty” Anderson; and the former Brexit negotiator David Frost. While they’ll insist they aren’t being disloyal, the overall spirit is ideologically and temperamentally at odds with both Sunak’s coolly technocratic government and the remnants of an older, steady-as-she-goes Conservative tradition that has been on the back foot ever since David Cameron lost his Brexit referendum. (It’s also anathema to younger Tories worried that banging on about the empire, or arguing that working mothers should be helped to stay at home with their children, is electorally toxic to anyone under 40.) No wonder Sunak has decided now may be an opportune time to invite all Conservative MPs to a free buffet in his back garden. If the National Conservative branding makes this group feel like a party within a party, that’s increasingly what it is. British Conservatism has been an uneasy coalition for a long time now, with the 2016 split between Brexiters and remainers evolving into something more like a split between populists and realists. The former are focused on campaigning, a world where complex questions always have easy answers; the latter are at least attempting to be in the business of governing, with all its awkward tradeoffs. The former tell the Tory base whatever it wants to hear about immigration, insisting that any problems will solve themselves if Britain just trains more HGV drivers. The latter – including chancellor Jeremy Hunt, education secretary Gillian Keegan and Sunak himself – aren’t necessarily bleeding-heart liberals so much as realists, focused on growth. Penny Mordaunt carrying the Sword of State at the coronation of King Charles III in Westminster Abbey, London, 6 May 2023. Photograph: Reuters Barely capable of pulling together in power, it’s hard to imagine them coexisting blissfully amid the bitter acrimony of defeat. The question is whether, in the shellshocked aftermath of such a loss, British National Conservatives could seize control of their party much as the US’s Tea Party zealots did to the Republicans. What’s telling is that what now passes for moderate Conservatism currently lacks both an obvious leadership candidate to stand against them if Sunak falls – though the sword-bearing Penny Mordaunt may be its best bet – and a set of even vaguely buzzy new ideas. For now, the rival factions remain awkwardly gaffer-taped together by electoral maths. Having seen what happened to colleagues who defected to the short-lived Change UK, despairing moderate Tories understand that any new breakaway party would effectively die an electoral death under first-past-the-post. But some are now privately pinning their hopes on the prospect, however unlikely, of a future Labour minority government being persuaded into electoral reform. Under a PR-type system, a breakaway party could finally become viable. As in any divorce, the question to be answered in a leadership contest would be which side got custody of the house – keeping the established Conservative brand name – and which was deemed the splinter party, forced to move out. Are National Conservatives the “real” Tories now, or cuckoos still capable of being expelled from the nest? Would Conservative members interpret being beaten by Labour as a sign that they somehow still hadn’t moved far enough right, or as a warning that the country had had enough of populists, thanks? Considering how long it took both the post-1997 Conservatives and post-2010 Labour party to understand why they actually lost, it would be brave to bet on a defeated party in 2024 jumping to the obvious conclusion. Keep an eye on this conference, lest it be the shape of things to come. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</body>

    <head>My wife said her ex was a better lover than me – and we haven’t had sex since</head>
    <body>I’ve been with my wife for 20 years. For the first few years we had a fairly active sex life, but suddenly, during an argument, she announced that sex with her former husband was better than with me. Since then we have not had sex. I guess this is because I subconsciously believe that if we do, I will be competing to be better than her ex. I have attempted to discuss this with her but she has closed the door on that possibility. She has also moved into her own bedroom because of my snoring. Is there any way back (or forward maybe)? A statement made in anger by one’s partner that is designed to hurt and humiliate is rarely fully accurate. Try not to take this as the truth. What is most relevant is that your wife has pushed you away and withdrawn … and it’s not really about your snoring. As a couple, you have some vital repair work that needs to be done. I would start by seeking some help for your self-esteem, and learn how to best open the conversation. It is likely that you would greatly benefit from couples counselling. Many people reach an impasse in their relationship, then simply retreat and live in misery from then on. Don’t let this happen to you. Remind your wife that you both enjoyed being together once, and implore her to join you in doing your very best to get that back.

    <head>ABC radio presenter Nicole Chvastek off air after lodging bullying claim</head>
    <body>The ABC regional broadcaster Nicole Chvastek, who disappeared from the airwaves several weeks ago, has lodged a bullying claim against the ABC in the Fair Work Commission. As host of Victoria’s regional statewide drive program for more than 11 years, Chvastek has been missed by some loyal listeners who have been petitioning the ABC to bring her back. The drive show reaches every regional area across Victoria, southern New South Wales and eastern South Australia. Guardian Australia asked ABC radio two weeks ago where she was and a spokesperson said she was “on leave until mid-May”. Related: No regrets: Fran Kelly says she understands as ABC fails to renew her talkshow for second season But on Tuesday an ABC spokesperson confirmed she was on leave pending a Fair Work Commission claim. Chvastek’s lawyer, Mark Comito of Stal Employment Lawyers, said his client “did not take lightly” the decision to launch legal action against the ABC but he could not go into detail about her claim. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Nicole is a senior journalist and presenter and has been employed, as you know, for some period of time at the ABC presenting the Drive program for at least 10 years,” Comito told Guardian Australia. “She is a well-researched and very reputable presenter and she wants the matter resolved as soon as possible.” Comito said she wanted the matter resolved quickly so she can return to broadcasting her program. A former producer for Jon Faine on ABC Melbourne, Chvastek has broadcast live for three hours daily from the ABC’s Ballarat studio since 2012. One listener started a petition calling her for her reinstatement.

    <head>Afternoon Update: PM dismisses push to cap negative gearing; Wellington hostel fire; and video of US guard killing trans man</head>
    <body>Good afternoon. Labor backbenchers are pushing party leaders to commit to a more ambitious housing policy, including capping negative gearing to one property. The call comes amid anxiety among Labor ranks that the party could bleed young inner-city voters to the Greens unless it takes a bolder approach on housing. Separately, it was revealed today that higher rents played a role in the Reserve Bank’s surprise decision to hike interest rates this month, with warnings of more rises to come. And in tragic news across the Tasman, a fire at a Wellington hostel has left at least six dead. Top news Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese in Melbourne on Tuesday. Photograph: Diego Fedele/AAP Labor’s negative gearing push | The independent MPs Helen Haines and David Pocock – regular advocates on housing reform – welcomed the Labor backbench push, while Anthony Albanese brushed it off, saying: “The government’s position [on negative gearing] is very clear and it’s a position for which we received a mandate at the 2022 election and I’m someone who keeps the commitments that we made.” Police took ‘bizarre’ approach to Lehrmann case | Mark Tedeschi, a lawyer acting for the ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, told the inquiry this morning that the ACT police had “undercharged” cases of sexual abuse, and that its “bizarre approach … about whether Mr [Bruce] Lehrmann should be charged is just an example of a general attitude”. Lehrmann has consistently denied raping Brittany Higgins. Queensland police commissioner Katarina Carroll.

    <head>Victorian councils to hold emergency meeting on far-right targeting of drag queen storytime events</head>
    <body>Councils across Victoria will host an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the growing crisis of far-right groups targeting LGBTQ+ events after another drag storytime was cancelled this week. A drag storytime event at Woodleigh School on the Mornington Peninsula scheduled for Thursday has been cancelled. Another event which was set to take place at Eltham library in Melbourne on Wednesday has been moved online amid threats to staff safety. The latest decisions mean at least 10 LGBTQ+ events across Victoria have been cancelled or postponed in the past six months after being targeted by far-right groups. Related: Councils call off drag storytime and LGBTQ+ events in Victoria after far-right threats The deputy principal of Woodleigh School, Rod Davies, said they had been targeted by far-right groups after a Herald Sun article reported they were planning to host drag performers Frock Hudson and Dolly Diamond this week to celebrate International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia. “Frock Hudson had been a guest at our school last year, and they and Dolly Diamond were both invited to read storybooks curated by our teaching staff at our junior campuses this year,” Davies said. “As has been the case with a number of similar events, a systematic and targeted response by right-wing fringe groups led to the involvement of Victoria police, who advised that we should cancel the events to avoid any public altercation or disruption, which were among the actions threatened by those opposed to storytime.” Davies said the school had a long history of inclusivity and support for the LGBTQ+ community and backed the yes vote for marriage equality. The Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV) announced Tuesday that it will host a meeting this week for mayors across Victoria to help them manage aggressive behaviour. MAV’s president, Cr David Clark, said the meeting would focus on the increasing risk to safety with police and an expert in extremism addressing the mayors. “With the well-publicised rise in disruptive and unpredictable behaviour at council meetings, this session will provide councils with the most up-to-date information from mayors who have been impacted, VicPol, and other experts,” he said.

The Greens on Tuesday introduced a bill to the parliament’s upper house that would amend the state’s anti-vilification laws to protect people on the grounds of their gender, sexuality, HIV status or disability. There are currently no laws in Victoria protecting LGBTQ+ people from vilification, which covers inciting hatred in the public sphere, whether online or in real life. Vilifying a person because of their race or religion is illegal in Victoria. The Andrews government has already committed to changing the anti-vilification laws, with Victoria’s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, telling parliament earlier this month that she intended to introduce legislation on the former within 18 months. But the Greens LGBTIQA+ spokesperson, Gabrielle de Vietri, accused the government of dragging its feet. “The Victorian Labor government has known about the need to expand our anti-vilification laws for years now, but refused to act,” she said. “Now we’re seeing neo-Nazis, the far-right, and even members of our own parliament feel emboldened to spout anti-LGBTIQA+ hate. ” Symes said anti-vilification laws are “incredibly complex” and legislation takes time. She said the government is currently undergoing community consultation and is working with religious and racial groups already covered by the laws, who have said the current system is not working. It is also working to ban public displays of the Nazi salute.</body>

    <head>Age verification for adult websites may involve Australian government digital ID</head>
    <body>Age verification for adult websites may incorporate the rollout of government ID, the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has said. In March, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, delivered a long-awaited report outlining a potential roadmap for verifying that Australian users visiting websites hosting pornography and other adult content are over 18 years old. The roadmap has yet to be released. On Tuesday, Rowland said the government would release the report in the “near future”, but would first need to determine how the government response might cover other reforms, including changes to the Privacy Act and the rollout of government digital ID. Related: Dating app background and ID checks being considered in bid to fight abuse “We’re working through this methodically,” she said. “We are considering this as a whole within government because of course we’ve got other portfolios, we’re looking at digital identifiers, so really drawing all this together. We will do this expeditiously.” The federal government allocated $26.9m in the budget to the development of digital government ID. The project is likely to advance this year off the back of the Optus and Medibank data breaches and concern about businesses holding so much personal information about customers. Critics of age verification systems say that if businesses are forced to set up their own systems that require people to share identity documents it could lead to online “honeypots” and open people up to blackmail. Rowland said she acknowledged people had those concerns, and it was something the government was considering in its response. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “We’re in an environment in Australia where people are reticent to give over their data … We have every intention of bringing this to a conclusion and releasing the report,” she said. “But we’re doing it methodically and within those parameters, and we understand how important this is. “We do not want young people having unfettered access to pornography.” Inman Grant said the roadmap sought to strike the right balance in preventing children from accessing pornography but also ensuring people – particularly older teens – can find information about sexual identity or gender identity online. “It’s a very contextual thing. We’re not looking at a blunt force type approach and that wouldn’t be something that minister would support anyway, we’re also looking at holistic approach,” she said. “Making sure that we’re balancing the three legs of stool of privacy, security and safety. Inman Grant said the review had assessed all the current available technologies for age verification or age estimation, and their limits, adding that there had been a wide set of views among those consulted and there would never be one agreed position.</body>

    <head>Warragamba Dam walls may need to be raised for ‘safety reasons’ despite Labor’s vow to drop plan</head>
    <body>The controversy over the multibillion dollar plan to lift the Warragamba Dam wall may not be over, with incoming ministers in the Minns New South Wales government briefed that safety issues might necessitate work on the giant dam wall. Labor went to the March election vowing to dump the Coalition government’s plan to raise the wall at Sydney’s main reservoir by at least 14 metres. In the pre-election review of promises, the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) noted scrapping the project would save $3.9m in 2022-23, implying further funds had not been earmarked for the project. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Guardian Australia understands department officials told the relevant ministers last month that the wall may need to be raised for safety reasons. One person familiar with the briefings said the connection was a surprise, as safety issues “had never been raised before” as a reason for lifting Warragamba’s wall. Related: Warragamba Dam: health department feared raising wall could harm Sydney’s drinking water Government officials, though, declined to detail the nature of the safety concerns and whether lifting the wall would be required. A spokesperson for water minister, Rose Jackson, said “we’re still working through our response on the matter” and would provide more information when it became available. Premier Chris Minns, asked about the issues at media conference on Tuesday, confirmed that the dam may require “remediation works” due to “geotechnical risks”. “There are other geotechnical risks associated with the dam wall which means that Water NSW and the board of Water NSW may have to take action in relation to remediating the structure from an engineering point of view,” he said. Minns said Water NSW engineers had briefed the government “about next steps”, but he declined to detail the concerns nor the likely action needed to address them. Geotechnical risks imply an issue that may not require changes to the 142m wall, but rather changes to the ground that the dam sits one, one expert told Guardian Australia. Cate Faehrmann, the Greens water spokesperson, said matters of dam integrity or safety had not featured in previous arguments put forward by WaterNSW or the government to justify lifting the wall’s height. “If there are in fact safety and integrity issues it is up to the new government to seek comprehensive advice and, once fully briefed, be transparent with the public about this,” Faehrmann said, adding that such advice would imply the need for “an entirely new development application and environmental assessment”. “This would be an entirely different basis for works to those that were put forward by the former government, which was ultimately for flood mitigation,” she said. The cost of lifting the wall 14 metres would be $1.95bn, the PBO reported, citing Infrastructure NSW data. That sum, though, excluded the cost of biodiversity offsets to compensate for the environmental impacts in the world heritage-listed Blue Mountains region. Warragamba, along with other major dams, has a high-capacity spillway to allow water discharges in cases of extreme inflows in order to prevent water overflowing and causing erosion. The spillway was designed to cope with events projected to happen in the order of just one in a half-million years compared with the one-in-20 or one-in-50 year events endured by the dam in the past couple of wet years. Guardian Australia understands environment staff working on the offsets program linked to raising the dam wall asked management after the election whether they should continue the work. They were told to await further advice. Guardian Australia approached environment minister Penny Sharpe for comment. Her office diverted questions to minister Jackson’s office. Harry Burkitt, one of the environmental campaigners who had led opposition to the dam-wall raising, questioned whether safety issues might reflect a rearguard effort by “dam-obsessed bureaucrats in the NSW public service” to keep the project alive. “Throughout the 10 years of this proposal, dam safety was never cited as justification for raising or altering the dam wall, as the safety of the dam was guaranteed in 2000 by the Carr Labor government’s $200m investment in an auxiliary spillway,” Burkitt said. Related: WaterNSW claims Warragamba dam wall project stacks up despite not knowing cost of offsets “Unfortunately it seems not even the new Labor government’s policy will get between these fixated bureaucrats and raising Warragamba Dam,” he said. Steph Cooke, the shadow minister for water, said the Labor government’s opposition to raising the dam wall meant it had “abandoned flood-mitigation efforts in the Hawkesbury-Nepean” valley. “Labor must explain to flood-exposed communities how they intend to better protect them from flood risk,” Cooke said. The NSW dam safety committee referred questions to WaterNSW.</body>

    <head>‘The height of toxicity for women’: revisiting the era of the It Girl</head>
    <body>Lose weight. Have money. Give away money. Hire a publicist, even if it bankrupts your daddy. The no-bake recipe for becoming an icon of the 2000s is laid out in the opening salvo of Queenmaker: The Making of an It Girl, Zackary Drucker’s fizzy documentary about the founding daughters of a social revolution. Related: ‘The story is really complicated’: inside the controversial world of Pornhub It girls, armed with appurtenances both flashy and furry, have swarmed the earth since the creation of capital. But privacy used to be a cornerstone of privilege, and the gilded-age dictum held that the names of respectable ladies were only to appear in the newspaper when they were born, married or died. Drucker’s film chronicles the precise moment when a multitude of women of means dared to court the public’s attention. Which isn’t to say it was an entirely empowering development. “It was the height of toxicity for women,” Drucker said in an interview from her Los Angeles apartment, backgrounded by a wall of books arranged by color. “I think this film is about misogyny.” Drucker, 40, was living in New York and attending the School of Visual Arts during the time that Queenmaker takes place. She read the tabloids and frequented the downtown nightclubs where the characters that populate her film were VIP deities. Having a parasocial relationship with them was all but inevitable, and they helped shape her sense of self. “I was conceiving my identity as a woman at the time,” Drucker said. “I started hormone therapy in 2003.” Rising up, Aphrodite-like, in the ashes of 9/11 were Paris and Nicky Hilton. Ivanka Trump. Casey Johnson, the Johnson &amp; Johnson heiress who died in bed in 2010 at age 30. These young women were reality TV stars before there was reality TV – famous not for doing something but having all the things: bags and jewelry and invites. Many of them also had the help of R Coury Hay, the publicist who is seen in the film calling himself “the Queenmaker”. He molded Tinsley Mortimer, a statuesque blond from the south (gasp!) who had a day job (can you even!) into a social swan and future Real Housewives star. The power publicist made Mortimer quit her job (also a publicist) before agreeing to take her on as a client. He taught her how to show up to seven events a night in as many designer dresses. “I told her it was more of a silent movie game than anything,” he said. “That she really shouldn’t talk too much.” Another queenmaker was Paris Hilton, who figured out how to stir up intrigue without saying much more than “that’s hot.” The heiress cultivated and dropped best friends, boyfriends and dogs at cheetah speed. “She was committed to constructing a narrative around her that would keep people watching,” former gossip reporter Lola Ogunnaike says in the film. Ben Widdicombe, a one time Page Six reporter and author of the memoir Gatecrasher was among the producers who initially approached Drucker about directing the film. He appears throughout as something of a royal correspondent. “He was very much our Scheherazade,” said Drucker. The shape of the film was dictated by who was willing to sit for interviews. Only a couple of the It Girls themselves agreed to meet with the crew, including Olivia Palermo and Mortimer. “Many of them have elected not to be in the limelight anymore at this point,” Drucker said of the challenge. “It could have been more big-picture, but the more specific you are, the more universal it is,” she reasoned. Despite her unorthodox background, it was often Mortimer who was the top-seeded socialite. Nightlife queen Amy Sacco appears in the film to share that Mortimer was her personal favorite, and former blogger Emily Gould made sport of chronicling Mortimer’s every move on Gawker. Gould, now a novelist and culture writer, gamely agreed to appear in the film and listen to Drucker read aloud from her posts (eg “In this lengthy interview, Tinsley Mortimer shares her thoughts about the works of Marx and Engels. PSYCH!” or “Debutard Tinsley Mortimer’s handbag-line launch featured a worst-nightmare tableau of lookalike Tinsleys”.) The writer’s discomfort is palpable, her expressions of horror and anguish serving as signposts for the viewers’ own feelings when faced with the values of the culture in which we all participated less than two decades ago. Olivia Palermo. Photograph: HULU Another blog that fixated on Mortimer was Park Avenue Peerage, which read like a Mortimer fan zine. Its fawning author was eventually revealed to be James Kurisunkal, an awkward college student who updated posts from his University of Illinois dorm room. New York magazine was quick to offer him a gig covering the city’s nightlife. “They treated me like I was the second coming of Christ when I walked into the building,” the blogger recalls. The gig included another perk: a chance to strike up an IRL relationship with Mortimer. The film-makers recreate their first meeting, with illustrations of Vogue editor Anna Wintour and Graydon Carter, who ran Vanity Fair, glowing in the background. There she was, Tinsley Mortimer, in full glory,” Kurisunkal blogged breathlessly. “A vision in Dior. A summer tan, golden heels, and that long blond hair.” Their codependency was soon to fizzle out, along with the entire scene that was suddenly as outmoded as a Fendi baguette. The Occupy Wall Street movement trampled over the prevailing glorification of excess. Mortimer took a run at reality television, appearing in an ill-fated show called High Society. Kurisunkal shut down the blog in 2010. “I’m no longer fascinated by this world” was the explanation. The former fanboy was ready to become a main character. She is now living as Morgan Olivia Rose, a woman who looks uncannily like Mortimer. In filmed interviews, she sports down-to-there hair, impossibly long eyelashes and pneumatic lips. No longer dependent on each other, she and Mortimer drifted apart. “I felt like I was no longer important, and that was very hurtful,” Rose shares in Queenmaker. “She depended so much on me and then it was like … she just didn’t care.” When we last see Mortimer in the film, it’s late in the pandemic and she is still at it, cuddling a tutu-clad dog at an animal rescue fundraiser in Chicago. She is expecting a visit from Rose, whose affection has waned. “What do I have in common with these people any more? Abso-fucking-lutely nothing,“ Rose says. “What am I these days? A transsexual call girl.” “It was a great opportunity to evaluate the intersections of women’s experiences and to have a trans woman in that milieu,” said Drucker. “Nobody ever thinks of the trans person witnessing the thing. [In the aughts] we were just kind of in the cracks and trying to disappear.” The easy-peasy recipe has been updated for the TikTok age: why obsess over the thing when you can be the thing itself? Queenmaker: The Making of an It Girl is available on Hulu on 17 May and in the UK at a later date</body>

    <head>Queensland court quashes First Nations woman’s lawsuit due to length of time since alleged sexual abuse</head>
    <body>A First Nations woman has lost her bid for damages from the state of Queensland after a court ruled the length of time since her alleged sexual and physical abuse in care made it impossible to fairly adjudicate the case. Joanne Willmot, 69, alleged she had sustained a psychiatric injury after being abused from 1957 to 1967 while living in a foster home, at the Cherbourg girls’ dormitory and while visiting her grandmother. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Willmot was a “child of the state” until her 18th birthday under the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897. The legislation, which was repealed in the late 60s, made the state’s director of native affairs the “legal guardian of every Aboriginal child under 21”. Willmot had alleged the abuse started when she was placed in foster care at about three or four years old with an Indigenous couple, Jack and Tottie Demlin. Related: Blak MPs give First Nations women hope we might be listened to | Antoinette Braybrook for IndigenousX Willmot claimed Jack Demlin sexually abused her “on a weekly to a fortnightly basis” and that she was regularly beaten by the couple for minor breaches of their rules. Another foster child at the house, referred to as RS, is bringing a separate claim against the state for alleged sexual abuse by Demlin. RS claims she also witnessed Demlin abuse her younger sister and Willmot. The court heard the children were removed from the home in 1959 after reports they were severely malnourished and emaciated. Willmot was then placed at the Cherbourg girl’s dormitory where she alleged she was subjected to “severe floggings” by the supervisor, an Aboriginal woman called Maude Phillips. Willmot said Phillips disciplined her and the other girls by beating them with a tree branch, making them stand on one foot for two hours and putting them in a “women’s jail”. RS told the court she had told Phillips about the alleged abuse by Demlin but she became cranky and accused them of being “little liars”, telling them “Jack Demlin is a Christian man”. Willmot alleged she was also sexually abused twice by two separate men while visiting her grandmother at One Mile near Ipswich: when she was six years old in 1960 and when she was aged 13 in 1967. Willmot told the court as a result of the alleged sexual abuse she suffered “trauma, profound fear, anxiety, panic attacks, ongoing intrusive thoughts … and feelings so overwhelming that she had trouble breathing”. She argued the state failed to protect her from abuse and neglect when she was in their care, did not ensure her foster parents were properly trained or that she was monitored when visiting her grandmother. The state of Queensland pleaded that “due to the effluxion of time, namely in excess of 60 years, the defendant cannot ascertain the truth or falsity of the allegations”. As a result, they argued, “there cannot be a fair trial of the issues in dispute.” The supreme court ruled against Willmot in 2022, and on Tuesday the court of appeal again sided with the state of Queensland. It ordered her to pay the state of Queensland’s costs of the appeal. The judges said that due to the deaths of several key witnesses they were unable to properly investigate the allegations “which are critical to establishing liability on the part of the state”. They said the allegations were never put to any of the alleged perpetrators while they were alive and there “are no documents bearing upon the abuse allegations which could overcome this”. Due to the significant passage of time and the lack of witnesses available to be interviewed, “any trial would be fundamentally unfair, and there is nothing that a trial judge could do to overcome that unfairness,” they said. The child abuse royal commission found on average that survivors take 22 years to come forward due to a complex set of reasons. It made findings that sought to remove barriers to justice, which prompted states and territories across the country to remove the statute of limitation period that applied to such cases. Since then, the Catholic church has been criticised for using the deaths of paedophile clergy to claim it can no longer receive a fair trial and block survivors’ civil claims permanently. Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732). In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 802 9999. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html</body>

    <head>‘Outrageous’ leaks during Bruce Lehrmann trial stoked tensions between prosecution and defence</head>
    <body>“Outrageous” leaks to the media during Bruce Lehrmann’s trial sparked fury from the office of the ACT’s director of public prosecutions. Lehrmann faced a criminal trial in the ACT supreme court last year over a rape allegation made by his former colleague Brittany Higgins. The trial was discontinued because of juror misconduct, and a retrial ruled out because of the potential effect on the mental health of Higgins and Lehrmann. Related: Juror in Bruce Lehrmann trial ‘deeply sorry’ for causing mistrial Now an inquiry into the trial is examining what went on behind the scenes of the trial, and the conduct of police and prosecutors. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup According to documents tendered at the inquiry, Sky Jerome, a junior counsel for the prosecution, voiced concerns to Lehrmann’s lawyer Steven Whybrow after an article about the case was published in the Australian newspaper. The article was about a report that raised concerns about the “strength and reliability” of Higgins’s evidence, as well as her mental health and “how any future prosecution may affect her wellbeing”. It referred to what became known as the Moller report, which was secret at the time. Jerome sent a screenshot of the article to Whybrow and asked him who leaked the documents. It’s “outrageous”, she said in a text. Whybrow said he had “no idea” where the leak came from, but it was “100%” not his team, and said to Jerome “[I] hope you make the same accusation to the cops”. The inquiry has heard about ongoing tensions between the police and ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold. There have been claims a senior police officer believed Lehrmann was innocent, and accusations that Drumgold insinuated he was guilty. During Tuesday’s hearing, Mark Tedeschi, acting for Drumgold, asked Whybrow about his suggestion that Drumgold should have “reined in” Higgins. “Did you have in mind that something he could have done would have been to seek some undertaking from her, that she would not make any public comments about the case at all or refer to the trial at all or in any way interfere with the administration of justice?” Tedeschi asked. “Yes,” said Whybrow. Lehrmann’s lawyer has also been critical of a media release issued by Drumgold after the trial was stopped, in which the top prosecutor said he thought there was still a reasonable prospect of conviction. Whybrow said that “with the imprimatur of the DPP” the statement was “taken by people in the community to suggest that he had thought he was guilty”. The lawyer also spoke about meeting with a senior police officer investigating the case who Whybrow claims told him he would resign if Lehrmann was found guilty. Tedeschi asked Whybrow about his meeting with detective inspector Marcus Boorman. Tedeschi put it to Whybrow that Boorman was “quite distressed” and “thought Mr Lehrmann was innocent”. “Correct,” Whybrow said. “And then in the context of that conversation, he said to you that if the jury came back with a guilty verdict, that he would resign from the police force,” Tedeschi said. “Words to that effect, is my recollection, yes,” Whybrow said. Related: ‘Corruption’ or ‘stupidity’: prosecutor makes dramatic allegations during week one of Bruce Lehrmann inquiry Earlier, Tedeschi said police had a “bizarre approach” to the Lehrmann case, and that Higgins’s allegation of rape would have been ignored had it not allegedly taken place in Parliament House. Tedeschi said a report had found ACT police were “undercharging” when it came to accusations of sex abuse, and that this was an example of their “general attitude” to sex abuse cases. Drumgold knew that, he said, and it was part of the reason his relationship with police was poor. Whybrow said in his opinion it was Drumgold who was hostile to police.</body>

    <head>Sunak must be firm. Ukraine’s fate will be decided by war and diplomacy – not by sanctions</head>
    <body>Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to London yesterday on his surprise tour of European capitals suggests a last throw of the dice in his bid to drive the Russians from his country. He has justice on his side and is desperate for logistical support. He has shown he can use it well and deserves to get it. Related: Russia-Ukraine war live: Sunak tells Zelenskiy UK will train pilots but supplying fighter jets to Kyiv is not ‘straightforward’ As he did in his meeting with Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, he is also requesting additional economic sanctions on Russia. These are a different matter. Sanctions on Russia have failed utterly in their declared objective of deterring Vladimir Putin’s aggression. They failed to curb his initial incursions after 2014 and failed to restrain his barbaric conduct of the present war. They have not destroyed his economy or induced his cronies, let alone his people, to rise up against him. They may have curbed his trade with some current and former partners, but hardly by much. He can afford to play long. Sanctions have served Putin’s cause, in helping persuade his people that this war is one of flagrant western aggression against Russia. In addition, the inflationary costs imposed on the west have been stark – to the extent of weakening the western alliance behind Ukraine. Yet again the virtue signalling of liberal governments in the cause of “something must be done” has shot the west in the foot. Last week, the Arab League agreed to readmit Syria to its ranks and invite its leader, Bashar al-Assad, to next week’s summit. It has accepted that a decade of western sanctions have failed to restrain, let alone topple, one of the cruellest dictators on the planet. Sanctions have impoverished Syria’s poor, enriched its elite and dumped some 6 million refugees on Assad’s Arab neighbours. And yet, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE now seem likely to resume trade with Syria, leaving the US facing the prospect of having to sanction them, under its previous commitments. Western powers must also recognise the failure of sanctions against Afghanistan and Zimbabwe, which allowed both to move into the Russo-Chinese orbit of influence. This is similar to the outcome of the futile sanctions against Iran. Meanwhile, after the US’s weakening of oil sanctions, Venezuela’s President Maduro is expecting to be welcomed back into the community. In the cause of seeking to make the world a better place, the west currently has sanctions in place that affect about 50 nations. These nations generally share two characteristics: their peoples are already overwhelmingly poor and their rulers are overwhelmingly secure. In many cases, they have benefited from a besieged political economy, from which potential opponents flee into exile. Sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were exceptional only in being directed at a substantial trading nation rather than a poor one. They invited Russia to hit back in restricting gas and oil flows, the loss of revenue being partly compensated by the soaring price of both. The inflationary cost of living in western economies has been marked, destabilising one government after another. And yet Putin remains unchallenged in his Kremlin castle. None of this appears to have been predicted by policymakers. Economic sanctions are an ill-considered, ineffective and regressive weapon of economic conflict. Yet there are new reports that the G7 and the EU are considering a further long-term ban on Russian gas exports. At a time when a collapse in global trade is the greatest threat to world prosperity, western governments are apparently intent on furthering that collapse. They appear to want humanitarian catastrophe. Ukraine’s fate will be resolved by war and diplomacy, not sanctions. Western diplomacy has been blighted by stupidity. The world’s poor and oppressed people are those who suffer most. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</body>

    <head>Restart the Earth review – Chinese sci-fi is pacy plant-based apocalypse</head>
    <body>No doubt to Alan Titchmarsh’s great relief, the horticultural arm of the post-apocalypse flick is finally entering the growth phase, with the likes of Annihilation, The Last of Us and now this lightweight effort from Chinese director Lin Zhenzhao. The hubris here is that mankind has overcompensated for the desertification of the planet with cutting-edge research to promote plant growth, accidentally creating a super-species of sentient flora that has choked the Earth, and whose roving vines hunt down people to snack on. Yang Hao (Mickey He) is a bunkered-in dad skulking in the ruins with daughter Yuanyuan (Zhang Mingcan), fending off the triffids with UV light torches. His wife, one of the researchers responsible, has already become fertiliser, and he’s frantic when Yuanyuan is plucked from her bed by the creepers. But after rescuing her, they manage to hook up with a squad of crack soldiers from the global “Joint Command Centre” out running some sketchily defined save-the-world errand. Restart the Earth is not a film rooted in serious scientific study – or scrutiny of its own internal logic. Apart from the quickly passed-over UV thing, the steroidal plants don’t have any consistent behavioural traits. So Lin doesn’t so much build tension around that as put his squad through a 90-minute rat-run through a garden centre from hell. But the art design has a painterly Ozymandian splendour and, even if Lin seems to have cut-and-pasted his serpentine creature design from his own Snakes trilogy, the visual effects often have a homespun, almost Michel Gondry-esque look that’s a bit more charming than the run of the digital mill. Apart from the standard Chinese-blockbuster predilection for absurd levels of self-sacrifice (and copious tears all round afterwards), this doesn’t take itself too seriously and delivers just enough schlocky but pacy B-movie thrills. • Restart the Earth is released on 22 May on digital platforms.</body>

    <head>I’m an inspiration to my sister. Unfortunately, what I’ve inspired is a standup routine</head>
    <body>Two years ago, my sister was about to turn 50 and I called her spouse to see what he was getting her. He rattled off a number of ideas so catastrophically bad that I was silenced, unable to find the words for how badly he’d erred. He’d booked her a number of short courses, and got her flute repaired so that she could start playing again, having given up in the late 80s. There are two things that my sister absolutely hates, to the point of phobia: one is slugs, and the other is self-improvement. I genuinely thought she might leave him, but figured 50 was young enough for a second act. It turned out he was right and I was wrong: she is now a member of an orchestra. Running the numbers, he’s lived with her for almost twice as long as I did (they were teenage sweethearts), so I should have considered the possibility that he knew a thing or two. A standup comedy course was even more successful than the flute. She really liked it. She still does it. She’s very funny and, more to the point, incredibly agile. All her material is savage about people she knows well, so if, for instance, she looks out and sees her Mr in the audience, she has to ditch that set immediately and revert to the one in which she destroys her own children. So, of course I go as often as I can, just to see her white-hot panic as she mentally tears up seven minutes entitled “My sister is an arsehole”, and it’s got to the point where I really like open mic. There’s something about the generosity of the novice performer, where you can still see the fear in their faces and watch them power through it anyway, for no better reason than to make the audience laugh, that flips your brain into a place where everything is funny. Guys in their 30s with overbearing mothers, millennials and their adventures on dating apps, collectors of Star Wars memorabilia, Swedish émigrés with observations on British hygiene – people will tell you anything when it’s a choice between that and dying on stage. It’s like hacking their mainframe. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</body>

    <head>Tory Nation by Samuel Earle review – tangled up in blue</head>
    <body>In the early 1900s, the Conservative and Unionist party’s mounting panic about defeat by the Liberals led it into a familiar place: the gutter, from where it repeatedly warned of the danger posed by people entering the UK from abroad. “The whole scum of Europe may come to this country,” said one particularly charming pamphlet, “by merely concocting stories about being political or religious ‘refugees’, however improbable their stories.” A century on, this particular song remains much the same. As opinion polls and local election results highlight the Tories’ vertiginous slide from their landslide win in 2019, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, speciously connects people who cross the Channel in so-called small boats with crime, and says they “possess values which are at odds with our country”. Her ministerial colleague Robert Jenrick echoes those poisonous arguments, and insists that “the number of people who are willing and able to reach the UK today is astronomical, and vastly outnumbers what we are capable or willing to take as a country”. Whatever the past worries voiced by Conservatives about their reputation as the nasty party, the Tories have seemingly relapsed – tilting towards the far right, but also tapping into a nasty element of their own enduring political soul. As this fluently written survey of Tory history explains, this is only one of a seemingly endless array of recurring themes that link the party’s distant past to its present. Outwardly, it may look very different from the tweedy setup of yesteryear, fronted by the first British-Asian prime minister, and already looking ahead to its third female leader – who may, if either Braverman or Kemi Badenoch get the job, also be a woman of colour. But as Samuel Earle sees it, all these “transformations” and conflicts only mask basic Tory attitudes and instincts that are as ingrained as they ever were: to quote the Italian novel The Leopard, everything must change so that everything can stay the same. The book capably explains two innate Conservative traits that are beyond doubt: an unquenchable lust for power, and a deep belief in stooping to conquer By way of emphasising this continuity, Earle – who has had his work published in such outlets as the New York Times and New Statesman, and is studying for a PhD at Columbia University in New York – mixes up Tory history, in chapters that are about such broad themes as the British ruling class, our rightwing press, and how Tories have always portrayed the righteous, nostalgic country they claim to protect from radicals and leftists. Conservatism, he says, is always about “maintaining power, resisting the redistribution of wealth, and safeguarding the legitimacy of the nation’s elites”. Whenever it seems to go somewhere new, moreover, it tells itself stories that smooth over any sense of rupture, some of which have been truly mind-boggling. The best one here comes from Charles Moore, the former editor of the Daily Telegraph, and Margaret Thatcher’s official biographer. Some landed Tories worried about her beginnings in a Lincolnshire grocer’s shop, and her petit-bourgeois zeal for the free market. But others, Moore says, spread a rumour that she was actually descended from an aristocrat named Harry Cust, thanks to an affair her grandmother supposedly had while working as a servant on the family’s estate. As the Conservative MP Julian Amery saw it, there was “blue blood there, no doubt about it”. This is a parable about the Tories’ periodic bursts of reinvention never really being what they seem. Thatcher, Earle argues, essentially wanted to avenge the collectivism embraced by her immediate predecessors, and return to the small-state attitudes that had prevailed before the second world war. In the same way, the Conservative belief in Brexit is all about returning control of the UK to Britain’s old elites. “Conservatism is often pitched as the opposite of radicalism,” he says, “but radicalism is permitted – even encouraged – so long as it is in pursuit of restorative ends.” On the page, this is an elegant enough theory, but does it really stand up? By historical Conservative standards, both projects were remarkably ideological, playing their part in the creation of a modern Toryism that is almost revolutionary in spirit. In 2019, let us not forget, one survey of Conservative party members found that 63% were prepared to accept Scotland becoming independent if it secured Brexit, and 54% wanted us to leave the EU “even if it meant the destruction of their own party”. The long slipstream of the 1980s and the 2016 referendum, it seemed, had pulled the Tories away from Edmund Burke and Robert Peel, and pushed them closer to the mindset of Mao Zedong. As well as a tendency to allow the narrative tail to wag the factual dog, this oversight comes from paying too much attention to the Tories’ past, and not quite enough to their present and future: as evidenced by the fact that, now on to their fifth leader in seven years, they have become an unstable, volatile force, and Earle’s account does not really address that big shift. His other big fault is a tendency to resort to high-handed explanations of the Tories’ potent appeal to millions of people (founded on their trumpeting of “personal ambition, hard work and taking responsibility for your own situation”), devoid of the voices of actual Conservative voters, and thereby almost reduced to the level of a con trick. His lofty perspective is also reflected in a habit of portraying the political left as angels, which reaches its nadir in an unconvincing and completely superfluous defence of Jeremy Corbyn’s time as the leader of the opposition. Nonetheless, Tory Nation capably explains two innate Conservative traits that are beyond doubt: an unquenchable lust for power, and a deep belief in stooping to conquer. When the party hits trouble, they become even more pronounced - which explains why, even after endless disgrace and its recent seismic loss of councillors in many of its old Middle English redoubts, the possibility of this amazingly successful political institution winning an unprecedented fifth term in power has not quite been snuffed out.

    <head>‘As good as Yorkshire but without the tourists’: the pure poetry of Lincolnshire’s Tennyson country</head>
    <body>Lincolnshire, I am told, has a location problem. Despite being England’s second-biggest county, it remains somehow tucked away, hidden between the Humber and the Wash. “So there’s no reason to pass through,” Helen Gamble laments as she leads me from Bag Enderby’s church into freshly spring-sprung hills. As Lincolnshire Wolds Countryside Service project officer, one part of Helen’s role is raising awareness of this overlooked landscape. “It’s as good as Yorkshire,” she claims, “but without the tourists.” When most people think of Lincolnshire, if they think of it at all, they think: flat. And true, the southern fenlands are steadfastly non-undulating. But the northerly Wolds are the highest ground in eastern England between Kent and Yorkshire itself. Here, farmland, woods, chalk streams, rock seams and pretty little villages fold, rise and ripple. Recognised as nationally important, the Lincolnshire Wolds were designated an area of outstanding natural beauty in 1973, so this year celebrates the 50th anniversary. Which is keeping Helen busy indeed. St Margaret’s church in Somersby, the village where Alfred Lord Tennyson was born and where his father was rector. Photograph: Robin Weaver/Alamy To celebrate the golden jubilee, she came up with the idea of a “50 for 50” series of events, which began in April and runs until December. It has taken a lot of organising but promises to showcase all aspects of the Wolds landscape – to everyone. Today, Helen is giving me a sneak preview of a walk scheduled for September, a five-mile stroll in Tennyson country, amid the scenes that inspired the Victorian poet. But the 50 events aren’t all walks. “I wanted the programme to be accessible, physically and financially,” says Helen. That’s why there’s a mix of everything from walks to talks, farm visits, bee bimbles, cross-country wheelchair try-outs, hedge-laying sessions and star-gazing nights. And that’s why it’s virtually all free. “Most events don’t require booking and don’t cost anything,” she says. Instead, participants are encouraged to make donations to the Lincs &amp; Notts Air Ambulance. Old Wold way … a popular walk near Somersby. Photograph: Keith Skingle/Alamy Helen and I make a loop via the sleepy hamlet of Bag Enderby and Somersby village. Tennyson’s father was rector of both churches, and Alfred was born in Somersby rectory in 1809. At St Margaret’s, Somersby, we see the poet’s bust, his father’s grave and an array of Tennyson mugs and keyrings for sale. We edge around Holywell Wood, where he used to compose poems. And we cross a bridge over the River Lymn, the gentle trickle that sparked Tennyson’s much-loved poem, The Brook. “When we get to this point on the official event, we’ll stop and recite it,” Helen says. That poem ends with the lines: “For men may come and men may go / But I go on for ever”. The brook outlives us all, concluded Tennyson when he wrote it in 1886. However, with many of our waterways in a perilous state, that’s no longer a given. England has about 85% of the world’s chalk streams, and the Lincolnshire Chalk Streams Project works to protect or restore these rare, vulnerable habitats. So for my next taster of the 50 for 50 programme I join project officers Will Bartle and Ruth Craig in the steep-sided Hubbard’s Hills valley for a bit of messing about in rivers. It’s easy to spot them: standing amid the noisy bird-twitter, wearing wellies and wielding clipboards, they stare intently at the River Lud’s bottom. They’ve marked out a 10-metre stretch and are assessing every aspect of it on their complicated-looking forms, from the surrounding foliage to the speed of the flow. It’s like gazing into a whole other galaxy, all these invertebrates darting and dallying, wriggling their multifarious tails Collecting detailed information is vital for the project. “We can compare data before and after we’ve made improvements to see how a river has changed,” Ruth explains. To help do this, they enlist volunteers and hold events, including several for this year’s celebrations. People can get hands-on with restoration, explore usually off-limits areas and learn about the importance of chalk streams for biodiversity, water quality and flood management. Lincolnshire chalk streams project officer Will Bartle demonstrates his churning skills in the Lud … while fellow project officer Ruth Craig identifies captured invertebrate species. Photograph: Sarah Baxter (both images) I have a go, which involves wading into the river, placing a large net in the water facing upstream and kicking the bed in front of it for three minutes, hopefully churning up a good cross-section of local aquatic life. “Even from a brief moment of kick sampling, there’s quite a lot in there,” Will says as we peer at the spoils in the white tray. “We’re looking for diversity and amount. Species like freshwater shrimp, mayflies, cased caddis, signal crayfish.” It’s like gazing into a whole other galaxy, all these small but perfectly formed invertebrates darting and dallying, wriggling strange bodies and searching antennae – aliens in miniature. Thanks to volunteers doing repeated counts of trays like these, estimating species’ abundance, Will and Ruth can determine whether numbers are dropping and whether there are problems. As Will says: “It’s about engaging with communities to help people take ownership of their local chalk streams.” Related: My return to the Fens and their coast – a land of brooding intensity It has been a busy day, but I have one last facet of the Wolds to discover. The area, settled since prehistoric times, is acned with lost medieval villages. There are events in the 50th programme that will explore them; I manage a preview by checking in for a stay at Brackenborough Hall Coach House. On the eastern edge of the Wolds, this ancient farming estate has characterful apartments, fields of wheat and beans, a herd of cows and one of the best-preserved abandoned settlements – reduced to grassy bumps these days, but exceptionally well defined. Owner Paul Bennett walks me through the “village”, down the grid of sunken streets and on to one of the tofts, the raised plots on which tenants built their homes. Records show that, in 1332, 28 taxpayers lived here. But the Black Death and a breakdown in old farming systems led to its gradual decline. “Lincolnshire was once the most densely populated county,” Paul tells me as we stand in this abandoned piece of history, looking to Louth on the near-horizon, buffeted by the North Sea wind. “Now it’s the opposite.” Lincolnshire may be “empty” now – and “on the way to nowhere” – but even from a short stay, it’s obviously there are far more than 50 stories to unearth. Brackenborough Hall Coach House has three self-catering apartments (sleeping four to 12) from £270 for three nights. For Lincolnshire Wolds AONB 50 for 50 listings, see lincswolds.org.uk.

    <head>Not seeing the trees for the wood: willow shortage could spell end for Kashmir’s cricket bat industry</head>
    <body>For more than 100 years they have been making cricket bats from Kashmir’s willow trees. Along the highway leading to the town of Sangam in the Indian-administered region, dozens of little workshops display neat stacks of the roughly hewn pale wood outside. Inside, the willow is painstakingly fashioned into cricket bats, which are then shipped across India and to other cricketing countries around the world. The humid environment and fertile soil make the area ideal for willows, which traditionally provide the material for cricket bats. Kashmiri willow bats have a reputation for quality and skilled bat-makers here have refined their craft since the 19th century. But the plantations created decades ago are not being replaced by farmers, who are turning to more lucrative crops with greater resilience in a changing climate. Many have replaced willows with poplars, a faster-growing and more profitable source of timber, which is used to make plywood. If the government does not start afforestation of willows, over 400 bat manufacturing units will suffer huge losses Now the blocks of willow wood, known as clefts, are becoming harder to obtain, putting the whole industry here and the 100,000 people employed in it at risk. Kashmir’s cricket bat-makers blame the Indian government for not intervening and for in effect turning its back on the industry. However, Mehmood Shah, regional director of industries and commerce, denies there is a timber shortage and claims that the government is stepping in to plant willows.

Photograph: Kamran Yousuf According to Mehraj-ud-Din-Malik, regional director with Kashmir’s state forestry department, the problem has been exacerbated by climate change, which has made the land drier and so less suited to growing the trees. “Willow trees require damp land, but the amount of such area has decreased,” he says. “The farmers are preferring plantations of poplars. This is because the farmers are not able to earn a profit and the wood suppliers buy willow at dirt-cheap prices. “Farmers are staying away from willow plantations on a large scale because of this and there is not sufficient land available for willow plantation.” Fawzul Kabeer, who owns one of Kashmir’s most successful cricket bat companies, Gr8.

Photograph: Kamran Yousuf One of the valley’s most established bat manufacturers is Gr8, which started making unbranded bats for other manufacturers in 1974. Its owner, Fawzul Kabeer, decided to develop his own brand that would adhere to international standards in 2010. His proudest moment came in 2021, when his bats were approved for use in the T20 World Cup by the Oman Cricket Board. Several players used his bats and the following year Junaid Siddique, a Pakistani-born cricketer who plays for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) national cricket team, hit the longest six in the 2022 World Cup using a Gr8 willow bat. “We have been providing cricket bats to 17 cricket-playing nations, including Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, UAE and a few others,” says Kabeer. “We provided a cheaper alternative to the English willow bat. But this shortage of willow could shatter our hard work and dreams in just a decade.” A Kashmiri craftsman examines stacks of wood being seasoned at a sawmill in Sangam, near Srinagar, before they are used to make cricket bats. Photograph: Tauseef Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images He estimates that the existing plantations on government land will not be able to sustain manufacturing demand for more than a few years if replanting does not increase soon. “If the government does not start afforestation of willows in those patches, over 400 bat manufacturing units will suffer huge losses. “The skilled or unskilled labour associated directly or indirectly with the bat industry would be rendered jobless, and there would be no bats produced in the valley,” adds Kabeer. Mehraj-ud-Din Dar, a trader, agrees, “Farmers in our region would put willow on their farms, but right now no one is satisfied to do so, even though there is a growing need. To preserve this sector of the economy, the government must take this issue seriously.” Farooq Ahmad, a willow supplier, says the plywood industry is also buying up the remaining stocks of willow. “We prefer to sell our stock of willow to plywood factories as they do not fish out rough logs and give better rates than bat manufacturers,” he adds.

Photograph: Kamran Yousuf “Farmers plant poplar trees because profit rates in willow are minuscule.” According to India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry, there are 400 bat manufacturers in southern Kashmir, in an industry worth 1bn rupees (£9.7m) a year. The shortage of willow has already put numerous small-scale producers out of business and cut the productivity of others. The demise of the industry would hit the area hard.

We have adequate availability of willow trees across Kashmir valley, and accurate data of willow patches will be available with the social forestry department,” he says. Those within the industry are looking for solutions, planting their own willows where they can and investigating the use of other materials but are not confident that Kashmir’s famous cricket bats will survive.</body>

    <head>Kettle’s Yard: how Britain’s avant garde found a cosy home in Cambridge</head>
    <body>What drives art collectors? They often seem obsessive, driven to fill a mysterious lack, from Charles I, who amassed a hoard of Renaissance art that helped provoke his subjects to civil war, to Charles Saatchi, who had so many contemporary artworks he had to store them in a warehouse which caught fire. But there is also a mysterious category of collectors, such as John Soane and Rudolf II of Prague, who turn their collections into cabinets of curiosities haunted by their presence. Another of them was the 20th-century British collector Jim Ede. The place Ede created is Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge, an open, spacious home formed by joining four ruinous cottages which he filled with his collection of modern art by the likes of Brâncuși, Gaudier-Brzeska and the Anglo-Welsh artist and poet David Jones. Today it’s known for its adjoining contemporary exhibition space, but next time you go, do yourself a favour and visit Ede’s museum-home, which is still preserved as the livable, relaxed yet artistically sublime little world it was when he gave it to Cambridge University in 1966. Laura Freeman, art critic of The Times, tells me how she discovered it in her first week at university: “I found freshers’ week difficult, especially as I don’t drink.” Instead, the ethereal magic of the quiet, art-filled house across the road from her college entranced her. Now she has written the first proper biography of Ede and his collection, delving into one of the strangest stories in British art. As well as going deep in the archives she has interviewed more than 80 people who met the genius of Kettle’s Yard before he died in 1990 at the age of 95. “This was during lockdown, and these people in isolation were delighted to talk about him for hours on the phone”. An open spacious house … Kettle’s Yard. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian Yet the man she has exhumed is still an enigma, to me at least. Ede seems to have lived through the art he treasured. He was not so much a failed artist as someone who thought vaguely about becoming a failed artist. But he had a knack for collecting. As a child of religious Victorian parents in south Wales, he started a lifelong habit of searching for curvaceous pebbles. Freeman writes intimately about “Jim” – which was a name he gave himself: he was born Harold Stanley Ede. Yet he still comes across as not quite the hero of his own life. Instead, its heroes are the artists he adored, collected and in many cases befriended. It’s a home, yet also a kind of chapel Asked about his experiences in the first world war, Ede told people to read Siegfried Sassoon’s Memoirs of An Infantry Officer because his own memories were not much different. His own war led him from the western front to Cambridge. As an officer in the trenches he was no coward, yet the stress and filth gave him such severe gut trouble he was invalided home and sent to teach student soldiers by the River Cam. Ede never went to university but his wartime dinners with dons made him fall in love with this rural-academic town where eventually, in the 1950s, he would buy Kettle’s Yard to house his collection. The Great War haunts its pastoral calm. Jones, like Ede, survived the western front, and became one of its poets, transfiguring his memories of the Battle of the Somme in his epic In Parenthesis. Ede befriended Jones and often had him as a guest at his home: there’s really nowhere else that you can appreciate this poet’s art as you can here. Vexilla Regis, a depiction of a deep dark wood, refers to the ancient Romans and Arthur, but you can hear the distant artillery fire through the trees. It’s the Welsh answer to the German history painter Anselm Kiefer. The other artist you can only really understand by visiting Kettle’s Yard never made it through the first world war. Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was French but became an avant garde artist in Britain before 1914 and was championed by Ezra Pound as a “vorticist”. He took the surname of his girlfriend, Sophie Brzeska, which has always struck me as attractively feminist, but Freeman explains it was just so they could cover their unmarried status – outrageous at the time – by posing as brother and sister. Gaudier-Brzeska was killed in 1915, fighting in the French army at Neuville-St-Vaast. He was 23. And he might have been forgotten without some wheeler-dealing by Ede. As a Tate employee in the 1920s, Ede came across a hoard of Gaudier-Brzeska’s art and papers that had passed to the British state after the sculptor’s death. No one quite knew what to do with them. Ede saw his chance: he bought the stuff cheap, including Gaudier-Brzeska’s plaster models for sculptures he would never cast. It was a clever deal by a budding collector, writes Freeman. “But had he done wrong? By the Tate, by the Treasury, by the civil service … almost certainly yes.” Filled with Ede’s collection … Kettle’s Yard. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian Yet he saved this great artist from oblivion. Ede’s book Savage Messiah is still the definitive work on Gaudier-Brzeska. Even in making money for himself by getting the artist’s plaster models cast into bronzes that he sold to museums, he enshrined them in the canon. The original 1914 plaster version of Gaudier-Brzeska’s Bird Swallowing a Fish, painted green to resemble oxidised bronze, is for me the greatest work in Kettle’s Yard. Set among domestic objects there, like the most dangerous ornament in the world, it’s jarringly violent. A fat, squid-shaped, dead-eyed bird is digesting a fish with a tail in the shape of an artillery shell. Nature is as cruel here as Europe’s Great Powers, who mechanically marched into war in the year it was made. Swallowed by history like fishes in the maw of Europe, Ede’s generation were driven to search for meaning in the ashes. Kettle’s Yard is the answer Ede found. It breathes a belief in art as something more than decor or depiction: it’s a home, yet also a kind of chapel. Born in the Victorian age, Ede hated the pre-Raphaelites and found a truth in the abstract purity of artists such as Winifred and Ben Nicholson. For me, their version of the avant garde pales beside European contemporaries. But the charged atmosphere of the house gives even the most minor piece a quiet authority. Related: The 10 best art patrons Ultimately this was a very moral, British attitude to art that was, despite itself, rooted in the Victorian age. The 19th-century critic John Ruskin argued that nature is the moral basis of all good art. In finding analogies between the hole the sea makes in a chalk pebble and the voids in a Barbara Hepworth sculpture, Ede’s generation rooted abstraction in a Ruskinian reverence for nature. Nowhere do you feel and understand that better than Kettle’s Yard, where Ede’s beloved pebbles are arranged to harmonise with the sculptures. Ede’s Puritan childhood never quite left him: Freeman tells how he was even shocked by Kenneth Clark’s book The Nude. Ede’s life and home are a walk on the mild side. And yet his world, safely preserved behind old stone walls, is the very best of the 20th century. • Ways of Life: Jim Ede and the Kettle’s Yard Artists by Laura Freeman is published on 18 May by Jonathan Cape, £30. Kettle’s Yard is open Tuesday to Sunday, prebook for house entry</body>

    <head>Grin and bare it: as mask mandates end Japan turns to tutors to relearn how to smile</head>
    <body>After three years of concealing their mouths behind masks, some Japanese people are turning to specialist smile tutors to relearn the art of breaking into a beaming grin without looking awkward. Since lifting the official advice to wear masks to help prevent the spread of Covid-19, many people have admitted to struggling to adjust to life without face coverings, with some confessing they have forgotten how to smile. “With mask wearing having become the norm, people have had fewer opportunities to smile, and more and more people have developed a complex about it,” Keiko Kawano, a coach with the “smile education” company Egaoiku told the Asahi Shimbun. “Moving and relaxing the facial muscles is the key to making a good smile. I want people to spend time consciously smiling for their physical and mental wellbeing.” Participants used handheld mirrors to check their progress, with some adjusting their expressions until they were satisfied they had rediscovered their natural, pre-mask grin. Egaoiku saw the number of applicants rise by 4.5 times after media first reported the impending Covid-19 reclassification in February. A month later, the government said face coverings should be an individual choice, and downgraded the virus’s severity classification in May. One of the participants, 79-year-old Akiko Takizawa, said she was excited about going back to her pre-mask life, with a little help from her smile coach. People wear face masks while walking through the intersection of Shinjuku, Tokyo. Photograph: James Matsumoto/SOPA Images/Shutterstock “I didn’t have opportunities to see people during the coronavirus crisis and didn’t smile in public,” she told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. “This has reminded me of how important smiling is.” The classes, which are particularly popular among women, typically begin with stretches to relieve facial tension before participants raise their handheld mirrors to eye level and flex parts of their face in line with Kawano’s instructions. “A smile is only a smile if it’s conveyed,” she told her students at a recent session in Yokohama, according to the Japan Times. “Even if you’re thinking about smiling or that you’re happy, if you have no expression, it won’t reach your audience.” Kawano, a familiar face on TV and social media, has coached more than 4,000 people in the art of smiling over the past six years, the newspaper said, as well as helping hundreds of others become certified “smile specialists”. She now oversees 20 trainers who run classes all over Japan. Early indications are that their services will be in demand in Japan, where mask-wearing was widespread throughout the pandemic. Just before official advice on mask wearing was eased in mid-March, one in four people said they would continue to cover up in all social settings. An online survey by Laibo, a research group specialising in careers, found that 27.8% of company employees in their 20s to 50s said they would continue to wear masks “unconditionally”, with just over two-thirds saying they would decide on whether or not to cover up depending on the situation. Only 5.5% said they were happy to go mask-free all the time.</body>

    <head>Tuesday briefing: Why Suella Braverman thinks immigration is harming Britain – and what the facts say</head>
    <body>Good morning. To absolutely no one’s surprise, Suella Braverman’s heavily trailed speech to the National Conservatism conference yesterday was an exercise in playing to her base. Her fellow Conservatives weren’t too happy about her attempts to burnish her future leadership ambitions: one accused her of thinking “being home secretary was some side hustle”, and another said most MPs were “rolling their eyes”. Her speech featured red meat lines for the right about trans people, why “white people do not exist in a special state of sin”, “the ethnicity of grooming gang perpetrators”, and experts. But most concrete was what she had to say about immigration – and why she thinks that the UK is in danger of “forgetting how to do things for ourselves”. Braverman’s speech comes ahead of new annual immigration figures, expected to be a significant increase on last year’s, which were already a record. But scratch the surface of her diagnosis and it becomes clear that her demand to reduce numbers she called “unsustainable”, and a danger to the UK’s “national character”, is likely to come up against significant opposition as unworkable – even from within the cabinet itself. Today’s newsletter, with Rob McNeil, the deputy director of Oxford university’s Migration Observatory, is about the reality underlying Braverman’s comments – and why it’s not as simple as she suggests. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with Rishi Sunak on an unannounced visit to the UK, hinting that he was hopeful of “very important” news on the provision of F-16 jets with the help of the British government. Britain meanwhile promised to supply “hundreds of attack drones” capable of operating at a range of 200km, but would not provide more details on the weapons. Carbon offsetting | Adverts that claim products are carbon neutral using offsets are to be banned unless companies can prove they really work, the Guardian can reveal. The Advertising Standards Authority will begin stricter enforcement around terms such as “carbon neutral” and “net zero” after a six-month review. New Zealand | At least six people are dead and 11 others missing after a “worst nightmare” fire at a 92-room hostel in New Zealand. The Loafers Lodge hostel in Newtown, in Wellington’s south, caught alight just after midnight on Tuesday, prompting an evacuation. Housing | Figures show that the average monthly rent outside London has passed £1,000 for the first time. Renters in the UK are typically paying 25% more than they were at the start of the Covid pandemic. The estate agent Hamptons, which issued the data, warned that the rate of rent rises was “unlikely to slow considerably due to the number of landlords looking to pass on their rising costs”. Technology | The EU has approved Microsoft’s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company behind Call of Duty, reviving its hopes of a deal and putting Brussels at odds with its UK counterpart. The Competition and Markets Authority in the UK and the Federal Trade Commission in the US have both come out against the takeover. In depth: ‘The position at the moment is not the new normal – it’s an extraordinary situation’ John Whittingdale, Theresa Villiers, Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Iain Duncan Smith and Priti Patel pose for a photograph at the launch of the Vote Leave campaign. Photograph: Reuters The Vote Leave campaign promised that Brexit would bring immigration under control – but while that has since been explained as the ability to flex up and down as required, it is likely that some voters understood it to mean that the numbers would drop. In 2019, the Conservative manifesto promised that “overall numbers will come down”. But the Johnson government relaxed restrictions on non-EU migration over the next three years. Net migration – the number coming in minus the number going out – was at 504,000 last year, the highest on record. This year, it has been reported that the Home Office thinks the total could rise to one million, and the Telegraph reports this morning that an internal document last year suggested another 1.1m in 2024. While the public has become more comfortable with immigration since Brexit – with 46% positive about the impact of immigration, 17% unsure, and 29% taking a negative view in an Ipsos poll last year – there is a swathe of voters on the right of the Conservative party who are worried about it. Those are the people Braverman was attempting to appeal to with her speech yesterday. *** Why are net migration figures going up? In part because there aren’t enough skilled British workers available to do the jobs that businesses need. In 2022, more than half of all work visas granted were for skilled workers. But that is only one aspect of the story. The increase in visas granted is also an artefact of the end of free movement, which means workers who could previously have come without any restriction now require a visa. There has meanwhile been a sharp increase in overseas students and their dependents. And the arrival of 174,000 Ukrainians after Russia’s invasion also played a part. (That figure, like the numbers coming from Hong Kong, is likely to drop considerably this year.) There are still shortages in many industries that the government tries to help businesses fill by allowing workers to come in from overseas. “There’s no problem at all with trying to find and train British workers to do things in principle,” said Rob McNeil. “The issue is with the attractiveness of roles. We just don’t have a load of people who are available to do these things.” *** Why is there such a shortage of British workers? The UK is an outlier on the lasting effects of the coronavirus crisis: in a report published in December, the House of Lords’ economic affairs committee found that an additional 565,000 people were economically inactive compared with before the pandemic – whereas in most countries, a spike in inactivity has since been reversed. (The charts at the top of this page show how unusual the UK is.) Job vacancies have risen, while unemployment reached its lowest level since 1974. The main factors: a growth in early retirement; the fall in EU workers who previously filled those vacancies; increasing sickness, partly because of lengthening NHS waiting lists; and the fact that the British population is ageing, which is responsible for about a third of the increase in inactivity. While Braverman’s speech implies that the problem is an inadequately trained British workforce, the evidence does not support that view. If that was the case, you would expect unemployment rates to be higher: rather than “forgetting how to do things for ourselves”, the problem is that we don’t have enough people available to do them. “We’re not in the situation of high unemployment that we had in the late 80s, for example,” McNeil said. “The supply and demand component is important – whether you have other options has a fairly straightforward bearing on your availability.” *** Is it true that the jobs Braverman cites can be done by ‘low-skilled’ workers? The Sevington Inland Border Facility near Ashford which was built to handle all the border checks needed for the post Brexit arrangements. Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/Antonio Olmos Braverman said that “high-skilled workers support economic growth”, but that “there is no reason why we can’t train up enough HGV drivers, butchers, or fruit pickers” and suggested that the British economy should be “less dependent on low-skilled foreign labour”. HGV drivers are not currently on the lists of occupations eligible for a skilled worker visa, but butchers are; fruit pickers are on a separate seasonal agricultural workers’ scheme. The framing of “skilled” work can become emotive, since it suggests that roles without that designation – like those working in care, a job where the British system relies on overseas workers with considerable “soft” skills but not intensive training – are without value. “It’s important not to confuse the technical description with that perception, or to denigrate jobs that require compassion,” McNeil said. “The skills required to work in a care home are significant. But it’s a technical designation to do with the level of training or education required.” *** What impact does migration have on the British economy? Despite Braverman’s argument that her own department’s policy is a failure, businesses in some sectors rely on it to fill vacancies. Critics suggest that the reason for the lack of a transition to a higher-skilled economy is that since Brexit, UK business investment has shrunk sharply against the previous trend. This Migration Observatory briefing explains that while the argument is sometimes made that bringing people in from abroad simply reduces the number of jobs available for British workers, there is good evidence to suggest that in some cases, migrants may actually create new jobs. A review of studies conducted by the Migration Advisory Committee found that “immigration had little or no impact on average employment or unemployment of existing workers” and “had little impact on average wages”. Students tend to have a broadly positive impact on the economy since they pay to live and work in the UK, McNeil said. (A new study found that international students boosted the UK economy by £42bn in 2021/22.) “But dependents, if they’re children or very old people, will tend to be more expensive. And so are asylum seekers, because they’re precluded from the labour market.” There is also evidence to suggest that over time, the arrival of working age migrants reduces pressure on the public finances because they are more likely to pay tax. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said in March that “a larger population, due to increased net migration, adds 0.5% to potential output in 2027”. Since it also increases the number of people sharing in that growth, it may not have much of an impact on people’s standard of living, this piece by the former chair of the Migration Advisory Committee Alan Manning argues. “The overall impact is generally smaller than people tend to expect – usually less than plus or minus one per cent,” McNeil said. “So it’s not fundamental either way to the success of the British economy. But it can have a significant impact in particular sectors.” *** So does Braverman’s speech mean the government will change policy? Nobody can know the future trend in net migration for sure, but McNeil suggests that “the position at the moment is not the new normal – it’s an extraordinary situation as a result of the Ukraine and Hong Kong schemes, and the liberalisation on student visas and allowing more dependents”. While Braverman’s speech certainly sounded like it went beyond existing policy, Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson sought to play down that idea yesterday: “We have said before we want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on overseas labour as part of building a high-wage and high-skilled economy and we’re supporting those industries to do that.” That doesn’t sound like a concrete policy change. McNeil notes that he is not in the business of predictions. But he does say: “There is a fairly long track record of what you would describe as symbolic policymaking in immigration, over many years and many administrations. And there will be a lot of pressure from businesses and lobby groups not to make decisions that will hamper them.” What else we’ve been reading An illustration by Elia Barbieri.

That picture again on the Times’ front – the splash is “Fifth of all taxpayers will now be in 40p band”, which you can read about here. The i’s headline to accompany the Rishi–Volodymyr pic is “UK backs Ukraine to join Nato”. “I loved my wife … she begged me to kill her” – the Daily Mirror covers this story, calling it the “tragic OAP trial”. “Gove’s blast at Starmer bid to ‘rig’ elections” – the Daily Mail on Keir Starmer thinking about giving foreign nationals the vote. “Suella: white people should not feel guilty” says the Daily Express.

    <head>Thailand election: will Move Forward be able to claim power?</head>
    <body>The election in Thailand ended with an unexpected result: the triumph of progressive, anti-military party Move Forward. But due to Thailand’s electoral system, the party still faces a tricky path to claiming power. So, what happens next? Who won Thailand’s election? Move Forward - a young, progressive opposition party - stunned many observers by winning 14.2m votes, more than any other party, and sweeping all but one seat in Bangkok. It had campaigned promising to remove the military’s influence from politics to make the country more democratic, break up the big monopolies that dominate the economy, expand the welfare system, modernise the school curriculum, scrap mandatory conscription, and – most sensitive of all – reform the strict lese majesty law that shields the king from criticism. The party is hugely popular among young people, and its success reflects changing societal values and attitudes towards power structures and key institutions. Pheu Thai, a heavyweight opposition party associated with the ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, came second. It had hoped for a landslide, and this is the first time in 20 years that it has not won the most seats in a general election. The ruling former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first came to power in a coup, performed poorly. Move Forward and Pheu Thai have said they will form a coalition along with other opposition parties, however they face major hurdles.

Photograph: Varuth Pongsapipatt/SOPA Images/Shutterstock Why is it so difficult for the winning party to form a government? Thailand’s future prime minister is voted on not just by the House of Representatives, whose 500 members were determined by Sunday’s election, but also by the unelected Senate. All 250 senators were appointed by the military after the last coup and they are generally seen as part of the conservative establishment that protects the political status quo. Move Forward’s policy platform, especially its pledge to reform the lese majesty law, could be a major block that means many senators will not allow Move Forward’s leader Pita Limjaroenrat to become prime minister. When will parliament vote on the next prime minister? A joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be held in July to select the new prime minister. Move Forward has said that, with its planned coalition, it would have 309 seats in the House of Representatives. This is short of the 376 that is needed for Pita to become prime minister. Pita said on Monday that he was not concerned about the Senate voting against him, and appeared to almost dare senators to defy the popular vote. “It is the consensus from the people, which every side should accept. Resisting the consensus will be of no benefit to anyone,” he said.

Photograph: Sirachai Arunrugstichai/Getty Images Are things over for Prayuth Chan-ocha? The election delivered a damning verdict to Prayuth, and he said on Sunday night that he respected democracy and that he hoped Thailand “will be peaceful and prosper”. He still technically has enough seats to be in the running for prime minister, though it would be difficult for him to sustain a minority government. But even if Prayuth’s political career is over, the conservative royalist military establishment that he represents remains incredibly powerful, and there are various mechanisms that can be used against its opponents. This includes not only the Senate but also the courts. Move Forward’s predecessor, Future Forward, which also promised reform and performed well in the 2019 election, was dissolved just one year later. Shutting down political parties is a common trend in Thailand, a country that is prone to military coups. Since 2006, nine political parties have been dissolved - including not only Future Forward, but also predecessors of Pheu Thai. A complaint has already been filed against Pita with the election commission, claiming that he owns undeclared shares in a media company. He has denied wrongdoing. What has Move Forward’s leader Pita Limjaroenrat promised? Pita said on Monday that he wanted to form a government as quickly as possible to avoid a power vacuum. “The sentiment of the era has changed,” he said of his election success. “People have been through enough.” He wanted Thailand to become “fully democratic” and decentralised, “with an economy that works for everybody not just the 1% on top”, and an ability to be flexible and adjust to new challenges – such as climate change or pandemics. He also said he favoured “rules-based diplomacy”, and that it was not acceptable for bigger states to bully smaller countries. Thailand should stick together with mid-size countries, he said, and contribute to stability in the region. He said he wanted to push for progress in a regional five-point plan that was created, and has so far failed, to resolve the crisis in neighbouring Myanmar, which is engulfed in conflict between the military junta and pro-democracy opponents. He also said he wanted to created a humanitarian corridor between Thailand and Myanmar – which would be a stark shift in policy.</body>

    <head>Flagship EU law to restore nature must not be derailed, warns environment chief</head>
    <body>A flagship law to restore nature across Europe must be agreed by member states or risk sending “a dangerous, negative signal to the world”, the EU’s environment commissioner has warned, amid growing opposition to the legislation. Last June, the European Commission revealed proposals for legally binding targets for all member states to restore wildlife on land, rivers and the sea. The nature restoration law was announced alongside a separate law proposing a crackdown on chemical pesticides, and both were welcomed as a milestone by environmentalists ahead of the Cop15 biodiversity summit in Montreal. But they have since faced strong opposition from agricultural, fishing and forestry lobbying groups and some member states. The centre-right European People’s party (EPP) – the largest group in the parliament – has called for the legislation to be scrapped, saying it would have a negative impact on farmers and claiming it would jeopardise climate commitments. Documents seen by the Guardian indicate that some member states are trying to water down both proposals, with particularly strong opposition to the creation of areas designated for restoration and to curbs on pesticide use. “We are standing on the edge of the cliff with biodiversity collapse and the rejection of the nature restoration law would be jumping into the void,” Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, told the Guardian. “The rejection of the most ambitious proposal ever to restore nature would send a dangerous, negative signal to the world that the EU and its member states backtrack on commitments.” A separate commissioner oversees the pesticides law proposal. “There is no possibility to implement the Green Deal without nature,” Sinkevičius added. “We can do excellent work in decreasing emissions. We can get to zero. But if ecosystems degrade, if soil degrades, if our forests degrade, if marine ecosystems degrade, they are not able to absorb carbon or mitigate heat. We have no technologies to replace them. The nature restoration law is equivalent to the climate law and I hope it will be taken as seriously,” he said. Ariel Brunner, regional director at BirdLife Europe, said the opposition from member states and lobbyists went beyond normal horse-trading in Brussels, and said abandoning commitments in Europe would undermine calls from member states to protect key ecosystems in other parts of the world, such as the Amazon rainforest. “This is very serious. There is a high-level attempt by the farming, forest and fishing lobby to kill the legislation. This is not a debate about details with the usual games, here there really is an attempt to just knock it off,” he said. “These two pieces of legislation [nature restoration and pesticides] are one of the three legs of the European Green Deal. Killing them means abandoning the Green Deal. It would be terrible for Europe’s standing in the world and would give credence to the Bolsonaros of this world who say that all the climate and biodiversity stuff is an attempt to keep us poor by the rich world so they can stay rich,” Brunner added. Time is running out on the EU’s legislative agenda to pass the proposals ahead of European elections next year. The EU was a key player in driving the environmental ambition of the final agreement at Cop15 in Montreal, which included targets to protect 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade and restoring 30% of degraded ecosystems. Related: EU plan to halve use of pesticides in ‘milestone’ legislation to restore ecosystems “It was not an easy task to find a balanced position between 27 member states in Montreal and negotiate with the rest of the world, but we managed to achieve it,” Sinkevičius, leader of the EU negotiations, said. “We helped set the standards of the agreement and it would do huge damage to lose this strategic position [if we do not pass the nature restoration law].” He said the bloc would make good on a scale-up of financing for biodiversity, as well as supporting public-private investments on nature. He added: “I’m extremely worried that Europe is heading to one of the worst droughts in its history. This summer could be truly difficult and those pressures will be felt by those who work day by day with the environment. By that, I mean our farmers. We have to do all we can to build in resilience and at some point it’s going to be too late.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features</body>

    <head>Sudan: Reports of women being raped in Khartoum by armed men</head>
    <body>There have been multiple reports of civilians being raped by armed men in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum where fighting broke out last month, say government officials. Four women and a girl, three of them refugees, are being supported by a specialist unit whose director said she thought most of the sexual violence in the city was going unreported. “I believe that the cases are way more than that, but because of what has been going on, not all the victims can reach us and get the support needed,” said Suliema Ishaq, the director of the combating violence against women unit at the Ministry of Social Affairs in Sudan. Two of the women said they were raped by members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The three refugees living in the city after fleeing violence in their own countries, reported being raped by unknown armed men. More than 600 people, including civilians, have been killed and more 5,000 people have been wounded since 15 April, when fighting broke out between the Sudanese army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti). The two men had been sharing power since the military coup in October 2021, which ejected the civilian members of a transitional government – itself created after dictator Omar al-Bashir was ousted. Just 16% of the hospitals in Khartoum are functioning at full capacity, with health officials reporting some centres are occupied by RSF forces, which control almost 90% of the capital. Ishaq said the violence and the lack of health resources meant her unit could only offer “the minimum of help”. “There are no safe passages to places where there are medicines, these places are being occupied,” she said.

Photograph: Reuters The UN has also said resources have been “severely curtailed” in Khartoum and in most of Darfur. “There are critical shortages of supplies for the clinical management of rape and dignity kits, as the stocks are inaccessible,” the UN population fund, UNFPA, reported last week. Related: Sudan’s doctors turn to social media as health infrastructure crumbles Despite the two sides agreeing on Thursday to protect civilians to allow for the delivery of humanitarian supplies, fierce fighting and airstrikes have continued across Khartoum and in El Geneina in West Darfur over the weekend. Peace talks between the two sides are planned for this week. As the commander of the Janjaweed militia, Hemedti is accused of previously using rape as a weapon of war in the two-decade-long conflict in Darfur. Armed groups have been accused of a series of rapes and abuses since anti-government protests began in Sudan at the end of 2018 and doctors in Khartoum said they believed the RSF had carried out more than 70 rapes when it attacked a peaceful demonstration in June 2019.</body>

    <head>‘We didn’t show we cared enough. We won’t make that mistake twice’: Ed Davey on love, loss and the Lib Dems</head>
    <body>I meet Ed Davey at his house in his Kingston and Surbiton constituency, a sprawling Edwardian semi. In the hands of a banker or, for that matter, a regular politician, it would be full of black and white tiles and plantation blinds, but in the hands of the Daveys it looks like an 80s novel, full of elegant chaos, every surface covered in papers, cellos and vests. The Liberal Democrat leader, 57, is unusually open and approachable, guileless; I start bombarding him with the kind of questions you’d ask a friend you hadn’t seen in 20 years. Why have you got a high chair, when your youngest is nine? How come you’ve got so many cars? Two of the cars are theirs, a little electric one and a mobility vehicle for their 15-year-old son, John, who’s disabled; one car is John’s carer’s, and she has a toddler, hence the high chair. One is John’s teacher’s – “he’s taught from home. We tried two special schools, but they didn’t work out. When we started home education, he was non-verbal. He’s now verbal. Which is brilliant,” he beams. We head out to the garden, where I congratulate him on the local election results. They have a good ground game, the Lib Dems, and they’re scrappy: even accounting for the way all parties manage expectations before local elections, they sailed way over their targets. “Our central scenario was about 250 [councillors] in five councils; we ended up with over 400 in 12 councils. So we’re pretty happy,” he says. They made 704 gains in the 2019 local elections, so this is shaping up into a solid recovery after the party’s post-coalition doldrums. “Because the next election is all about getting rid of the Tories …” he begins, and maybe I smirk a bit because he stops – he’s the last man standing of the Lib Dems who served in the coalition cabinet, so fierce anti-Tory rhetoric is still faintly incongruent – “… that is exactly my mission.” Will this party ever enable another Conservative government? “This is really important: we will not put the Conservatives back into government or do any deal with them. What. So. Ever. Personally, I’ve fought them all my life: I fought them in government, I’m fighting them now. They’re beyond the pale, as far as I’m concerned.” I’ve fought the Tories all my life: I fought them in government, I’m fighting them now. They’re beyond the pale A load of questions shuffle in behind that. What kind of deal would he be seeking with Labour? Is he already in negotiations with Keir Starmer? What would his asks be? Does he think he could get proportional representation over the line? He doesn’t answer any of those, instead giving me this helicopter view: “I’ve been reflecting on past leaders. I joined the party in 1989, I was economics adviser to Paddy [Ashdown], I worked closely with Charles [Kennedy], I had a period as Menzies [Campbell]’s chief of staff, so I’ve seen them close up, and seen them in election campaigns, dealing with this question. There’s a danger that if you focus on after the election, you just get distracted, you spend a load of energy thinking about something that might never happen. My job is to win lots of seats: primarily against the Tories; two against the SNP; one, arguably two, against Labour. I’m going to focus on my job.” His life in politics started in 1987, when he was 21, still a student, and he joined the Tactical Voting group, as he “just wanted the Tories out”. He emphasises that just because he’s had his whole career with the Lib Dems – only two years out of parliament since 1997, when he lost his seat in 2015 – he didn’t get into politics as a career move. And while it’s true that, in 1989, a careerist would have joined a party polling at higher than 5%, his life can still look smooth and gilded, from the PPE degree from Oxford to the succession of spokesperson jobs – education and skills, trade and industry, business, foreign affairs, home affairs – in a party that prized nicely spoken young men with common sense. This impression of an effortless life could not be further from the reality. Ed Davey at a climate change protest in London in 2019. Photograph: Claire Doherty/In Pictures/Getty Images He is putting care at the centre of the Lib Dems’ agenda, he says. “It’s the only way to rescue the health service. It’s massive for gender equality … and linked to that, social justice in and of itself.” To have that conversation, he wants to be plain about his perspective, which is not that of a policy wonk, but that of a man who has lived an extraordinary amount of his life as a carer. It’s difficult talking about my son’s disability and Emily’s MS. But it’s given me an insight into millions of people’s lives He describes a “relatively humble” background: his father from a mining family; his mother the daughter of domestic servants. Davey was the youngest of three boys, and his dad was doing well, working as a solicitor in Nottingham. When he was four, and his brothers were nine (Charles) and seven (Henry), John Davey died of Hodgkin’s disease at the age of 37. “Diagnosed in November, he died in March. I didn’t really know him. When you’re young, you roll with it. The big thing was seeing my mother’s grief, hearing it, knowing something tragic had happened.” His mother, Nina, moved with the boys to a bungalow, and was then diagnosed with breast cancer when Davey was nine. Three years on, she was diagnosed with secondary cancer in her bones. “Henry and I, with help from my maternal grandparents and neighbours, nursed Mum for three years,” he says. “The last 18 months she was bedridden, in a lot of pain. We had this morphine – I used to pour it out and give it to her in a cup.” He became incredibly close to her: “I’d spend hours lying on the bed, talking to her. I was by her side in Nottingham general hospital when she died. I was in my school uniform, on my way to school.” She had been put on a dementia ward. “It was incredibly unsuitable, very shouty, you know how some dementia can be.” Ed Davey with former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Jo Swinson en route to Downing Street, days before the 2015 general election. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images He tells this story matter-of-factly, but it’s full of searingly sad details – how his mother and grandmother bickered in the last few months, because his grandmother used to do all the buttons up when she ironed a shirt, and his mother would struggle to undo them; the carrot and apple juice fasts his mother would try, because conventional medicine was all out of ideas and she went to a naturopath; the ridiculously large meals his grandparents used to make him, when he went to live with them after his mother’s death. “And then my grandad died when I was 18,” he says. “I was pretty angry about that, after all that had happened. It was quite sudden, a heart attack, he couldn’t have been that old, 66. I think he died of a broken heart. He’d lost his only child, who he adored. He was a very, very emotional man.” Ed Davey got through all that without any academic missteps. He was at Nottingham High school, in the year above Ed Balls, and he remembers his conscious decision: “The summer after my mum died, in the kitchen by myself, I had loads of work to do. I thought, ‘I’m not going to do it.’ Previously, I studied to make my mother happy. Because that’s what you do as a kid. Are your parents proud of you? It was a real Rubicon moment for me. That’s when it could have gone wrong. But Mum had been a massive influence in my life, and I went the right way, rather than the wrong way.” With his wife, Emily Gasson, at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace for the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, November 2022. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA He spent a lot of time with his grandmother: all his university holidays, Christmases, just the two of them, well into his adulthood. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other. Then she got more frail, after I became an MP. Henry and I became her carers, not in terms of the care I did for my mum or for my son, but looking after her affairs.” When he married Emily Gasson, another prospective parliamentary candidate for the Lib Dems (she stood in four elections, but didn’t get a seat; now she’s a councillor), it was 2005 and he had to move his grandmother to an expensive care home in Kingston. “I said to Emily, ‘We’ll have to mortgage the house to pay for my grandmother’s care home fees.’ Which was quite something to say, because we really couldn’t afford it. The great thing about that care home was, they allowed her to smoke.” When Davey was about to give up smoking, Emily told him to wait until his grandmother died; she really liked having a fag with him. His son was born in 2007, and caring for John is “full on”, he says. “Without going into massive detail, you do the lot. I’m sure lots of professional carers do it with affection, of course they do. But when it’s someone you love dearly, your thought process is completely different. My biggest thing with my son is: when I’m not here, who is going to look after him? Sometimes he hits and pinches – you have to get over that. And my wife and I, we worry, when we’re not here … you read these awful stories about how people are treated. I’m sure all parents whose kids have special needs will understand. It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life.” Gasson, meanwhile, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2012. She recovered pretty well – she has remitting MS – then declined again during lockdown. “She’s fighting back, she’s gone fish-eating vegan, lots of exercise, lots of yoga – she’s trying to keep herself as healthy as she can and she does a good job with it.” Davey (centre) with former Lib Dems leader Paddy Ashdown (second right) in 1997. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy “Until I became leader, I didn’t talk about the care side [of my life],” he says. “Partly because it’s private. But I felt, inevitably, people are going to ask me questions about my life. It’s easy with my parents; that’s a long time ago. It’s more difficult with my son, and with Emily’s MS, but it is what it is, and it’s given me an insight into the reality of millions of people’s lives.” We talk about compassion, caring, pluralism, the health service. He’s really trenchant on this: hebelieves in socialised medicine, a completely overhauled system of care to reflect the collective responsibilities we have towards one another. And I have to say, given how central health and care are to his agenda, and how the NHS is as close to an experiment with socialism as we’ve ever come in this country, I’m surprised he’s not more leftwing. He’s not even to the left of the Lib Dems, though he mildly disputes his reputation as an “Orange Book” liberal (so called after the Lib Dems’ pro-free market 2004 treatise, which he co-authored). “I wish people would actually read my chapter in the Orange Book! It’s about local government.” Beveridge was a liberal, he says. But he wouldn’t have amounted to a hill of beans without the Labour party, I reply. David Lloyd George was a liberal, and he brought in national insurance, Davey says. The Labour party was barely five years old when that happened, I return. I appear to be trying to persuade the leader of the Lib Dems to join a socialist Labour party that doesn’t even exist, using a GCSE study guide on the 20th century. Nick Clegg wanted to show coalitions work. I argued we should show the bit of the Liberals that’s anti-establishment I suppose it’s because that period in coalition, the start of the most callous government in living memory, still casts a shadow. Davey says he was fighting the Tories constantly: “I didn’t trust them an inch. I didn’t trust George Osborne an inch. We didn’t tell people how much we were fighting the Tories, that was by design, from Nick [Clegg]. He wanted to show that coalitions work. I argued that we should show the bit of the Liberals that’s anti-establishment, that’s reformist, that’s internationalist. But he was the leader. We served at his pleasure.” He names a few big wins over the Conservatives from those years: the Liberal Democrats successfully locked in the government’s offshore wind contracts, so Osborne couldn’t rescind them after 2015, as he tried to; they stopped the Tories freezing benefits when inflation was running at 5%. “I believe in our environmental stuff, I believe in our political reform, I believe in our internationalism, I believe in civil liberties, I believe in our support for public services, I believe we’re caring, that’s who we are. And we weren’t showing it enough. We’re not going to make that mistake twice.” As I get ready to leave, Ed Davey introduces me to John, who is playing a card memory game with his teacher and carer in the room at the front where he does his schooling. Everyone’s encouraging John, very gently, to say “hello”, and my name, and he gets overwhelmed for a second and buries his head in his father’s shoulder, who soothes him so that he can come out with a triumphant, “Hello Zoe!” It’s a moment of ineffable tenderness, trust and patience, such that you’d probably only witness between two other people a handful of times in your life. I thought I was going to make the whole situation a million times more stressful by bursting into tears, but pulled it back from the brink, thank God, by thinking: It would be funny if, after a lifetime trying to persuade people to vote Labour, I ended up voting Lib Dem.</body>

    <head>AI songwriting is not a sin, says Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys</head>
    <body>Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys has suggested artificial intelligence (AI) could be a useful tool in a songwriter’s kit amid fears over the impact of the technology on the music industry. In an interview with Radio Times, Tennant, who founded the synthpop duo more than 40 years ago, suggested AI could be used to help musicians overcome writers’ block and finish songs. His comments come as the music industry is beginning to mobilise against the perceived threat of fake songs. In October, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) warned that AI companies were violating copyrights en masse by using music to train their machines. A song featuring AI-generated vocals purporting to be Drake and the Weeknd was pulled from streaming services by Universal Music Group (UMG) in April after going viral. The label condemned the song, called Heart on My Sleeve, for “infringing content created with generative AI”. But Tennant strikes a more optimistic tone with his interview in Radio Times. He recounts being amazed by the 15-year-old daughter of the act’s manager asking a bot to come up with a song in the style of Pet Shop Boys. “There’s a song that we wrote a chorus for in 2003 and we never finished because I couldn’t think of anything for the verses,” he said. “But now with AI you could give it the bits you’ve written, press the button and have it fill in the blanks. You might then rewrite it, but it could nonetheless be a tool.” The duo said they had been impressed by Abba Voyage, the “virtual residency” show in which the Swedish popstars are represented by avatars of their younger selves. In March, the Entertainment Industry Coalition published a series of seven core principles regarding the relationship between artificial intelligence and music, detailing the need for AI to “empower human expression” while also asserting the importance of representing “creators’ interests … in policymaking”. Tennant, 68, and his long-term bandmate Chris Lowe, 63, headlined the Other Stage at the Glastonbury festival last year, drawing one of the event’s biggest crowds.</body>

    <head>Afghan families in Yorkshire issued with eviction letters from Suella Braverman</head>
    <body>Afghan refugee families uprooted from London to Yorkshire earlier this year have been issued with eviction notices in the name of Suella Braverman. This will be the fourth time that some of the families have been forced to move home, sometimes leaving jobs and schools, since being airlifted out of Kabul to the UK in August 2021. They were invited to the UK under Operation Pitting because at least one family member worked closely with the British authorities and it was believed that their lives would be at risk if they remained in Afghanistan. The letters were delivered after the UK government announced in March that it would move all 8,000 Afghans out of temporary bridging accommodation or hotels this year and said they must accept the first offer of accommodation from the Home Office. The letters said: “For the avoidance of doubt, if possession is not delivered upon by the notice date, you will be a trespasser and the secretary of state for the home department shall be at liberty to evict you from the property.” The families, including a special forces soldier, a translator and a political adviser, say they have attempted to find homes themselves but have been thwarted by slow bureaucracy within the Home Office and local councils. Mohamed, one of the Afghan residents, said he had found and then lost two available properties in outer London after problems that the Home Office could not solve. He said: “There has been problems for all of us – with either the guarantor, the deposit or the eligibility of the local authority, or not having a job. This has all been made worse because we have been moved from London to Yorkshire, leaving jobs and contacts behind.” A previous letter sent to the families implied that the Home Office would find them a place to live, the residents said. The letter, sent last Thursday and seen by the Guardian, says: “When you receive a housing offer from us, it is strongly advised that you accept so that you can start your settled life in the UK.” But on Saturday, Home Office officials said the hotel residents might not be offered any alternative accommodation and may have to find their own accommodation instead. Asked for a comment, a Home Office spokesperson said: “Hotels are not, and were never designed to be, suitable long-term accommodation for Afghans resettled in the UK. That is why we have announced a plan, backed by £285m of new funding, to speed up the resettlement of Afghans into long-term homes. “Where available, the government will continue to make offers of suitable housing, which we strongly encourage Afghan families to accept. Where an offer cannot be made or is rejected, increased government support is available to help Afghans find their own homes and begin rebuilding their lives here.”</body>

    <head>The Tories are on the ropes now – and Labour’s knockout blows are not far away</head>
    <body>How rare it is to be able to pinpoint the day you witnessed the winds of change sweeping away the old political landscape. As I wrote just before the local elections, I felt that great doorstep surge in Lightwater, in Michael Gove’s Surrey Heath constituency. Sure enough, those angry Tory voters did desert his party in droves, turning three forever blue seats Lib Dem yellow and giving the Liberal Democrats control of the council. What’s Gove’s response to his constituents’ rebellion? He ignores it, heading off to the wilder shores of rightwingery that has just been rejected, to speak at the National Conservatism three-day jamboree in Westminster. This low-tax, small-state religio-populism, which has much in common with the Tea Party movement, Viktor Orbán and Donald Trump, is on another planet from Gove’s voters. With other senior colleagues who also attended – some fresh from another Tory rightist rebel conference at the weekend – they reveal how little they have absorbed of views expressed through the ballot box at the local elections. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, might pause to ask how the Tories lost symbolic Dover, given that she thinks the small boats issue is so hot it can outweigh the cost of living crisis, the NHS and broken public services to save her party’s political skin. Instead of heading for east Kent to rethink, she took to the NatCon platform to complain about British people forgetting how to work, leaving it to migrants she calls criminals lacking “our values”. Facing an electoral abyss brings out bizarre behaviour in political parties, with ideologues retreating into realms of fantasy unshared by voters. Tory revolutionaries provide Labour with a smug reminder of themselves when they turned unelectable under Michael Foot or Jeremy Corbyn. Then, Labour convinced itself that the voters only rejected its recipes because they weren’t pungent enough. Only cognitive dissonance lets these Tories ignore last week’s triumph of progressive parties. This usually conservative country rejected their rightwing austerity government, the English vote going 60% progressive against 29% Tory. Polls show a quarter of Lib Dem voters saying they will tactically turn Labour in a general election – that’s outright victory territory. Alas, Keir Starmer said at the weekend that electoral reform was “not one of [his] priorities”: but at least he didn’t absolutely rule it out, for tactical voting on this scale reflects high public support for a proportional system. Although he was demolished at the polls, Rishi Sunak is probably not in peril, a sixth prime minister in seven years is a stretch too far even for his party. But he’s lost control, with his five pledges already failing. As Starmer mocked, in an aside to a questioner this weekend: “You don’t have Suella Braverman in your cabinet on merit, but because you’ve lost control of your party.” That brutal quip signalled how success gives an opposition leader new buoyancy. Starmer’s aides say he is “emboldened”, and so he was in his speech to Progressive Britain. A stronger note of radicalism saw him shed some of the over-caution that has weighed him down. Of course he warned as a distance runner that “the hardest yards always come at the end”, but “make no mistake – we are on track. We are on a path towards power.” And so they are. That path was mapped out in stolid Starmer steps from day one. After 2019’s worst defeat in living memory ripped out Labour heartlands, he has made his party virtually unbeatable in a journey that took Neil Kinnock, John Smith and Tony Blair aeons longer. Ruthlessly scotching internal turmoil and leftist antisemitism, he has remade a party in his own image, with candidates and party officials sometimes bruisingly sealed with his own stamp. To borrow from George W Bush, too many have “misunderestimated” him, both his strategic nous and his radical intent: these results should stop that. True, he faces a Tory party taken leave of its senses, driving the country to near-perdition, but he warns it’s “not enough that we’re better than the Tories”. Describing the barren landscape he’ll inherit, he promised as great a transformation as Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Blair’s Labour governments. Momentum’s remnants grumble that he offers no more than “New Labour re-runs”, but they should hope he can cut child and pensioner poverty by a million people; revive benefits, Sure Start programmes for tots and further education colleges; and renew local museums and grassroots sport to outdo New Labour’s 13 abundant years from 1997 to 2010. It will be harder this time. “Where’s the beef?” Nick Ferrari kept asking Starmer on LBC on Monday morning, echoing people impatient for more policy announcements. Yet that £28bn a year on green growth and insulation is big, and his mission to raise UK growth from the bottom to the top of the G7 in one term is frighteningly enormous. So too are pledges to achieve 100% clean energy by 2030, fix the broken NHS, create a National Social Care service and provide quality childcare. The Labour revolution in working rights, fair pay deals, zero hours and unions allowed into every workplace will change the balance of power at work. Branding Labour the “party of the common good” in his speech to Progressive Britain is a reminder that it will take back each rail contract and create a Great British Energy, with Rachel Reeves promising “radical insourcing” of services. Starmer will keep hammering away at “security” for all – in jobs, housing and income in hard times – as he parks on vacated Tory turf. The Tories “conserve nothing of value – not our rivers and seas, not our NHS or BBC, not our families, not our nation”, he said in his speech. VAT on private schools to be diverted to stricken state schools; the funds raised by ending non-dom tax avoidance to be used for the NHS; a windfall tax on oil giants’ profits – these are all just tasters of Starmer’s radical vision. Bored with them already? That’s a good reason for Labour not to announce plans too early, timing policy to breast the tape at the election. Expect more detailed announcements shortly on health, opportunity and the environment, quickening the pace at the party conference in October. But don’t expect tax and spend details until next year’s March budget shows the Tories’ hand. Glum Tory newspaper leaders warn, “Only a bold vision can save the Tories now”, though they can only produce very old ideas for the very rich: “A commitment to axe inheritance tax. An end to stamp duty. A renewed bonfire of EU red tape.” Starmer gets the same “bold vision” moan, but hoary old ideological totems don’t win against practical policies – hope comes from concrete change for better lives and public services. Too dull? No “Oh, Keir Starmer!” Glastonbury chants? He just brings home the boring old votes, votes and more votes from Blackpool to Middlesbrough, Medway to Brighton. There is something beseeching about Sunak’s “morale-boosting” garden party on Monday night at No 10 for his MPs, with pies from his Yorkshire constituency. It won’t appease rightwing Tory fanatics, nor ease the panic of all who saw their seats vanish before their eyes last week. Deluded and dispirited, as the Tories are now, so once was Labour. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</body>

    <head>International students boosted UK economy by £42bn in 2021/2 – study</head>
    <body>The economic benefit international students bring to the UK has jumped by a third in three years, boosting the economy by an estimated £42bn in 2021/2, according to new analysis. The report, by analysts London Economics, said the economic benefit to the country rose from £31.3bn in 2018/9 to £41.9bn three years later as growing numbers of international students choose to study in the UK. The research, published on Tuesday, comes at a time when the government is considering imposing restrictions on international students coming to the UK as part of its efforts to reduce the net migration figure. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is said to be braced for a record increase in net migration this month. Some reports estimate that the figure could reach close to a million, up from 504,000 last year. Among the measures ministers are thought be considering are visa restrictions for international students’ dependants and reductions in their post-study work visa rights, both of which would act as a deterrent to potential overseas students. The report, The Costs and Benefits of International Higher Education Students to the UK, is published by Universities UK International (UUKi), the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and Kaplan International Pathways, in collaboration with London Economics. Related: UK curbs on international student visas would be ‘act of economic self-harm’ Jamie Arrowsmith, UUKi director, said: “We should be proud that our universities continue to attract students from all over the world. It is vital that the UK remains an open and welcoming destination for international students, and that their contribution is recognised and valued.” There has been a 68% increase in the number of new international students from non-EU countries since 2018/9 – the number of EU students has however plummeted post-Brexit – and universities have become increasingly dependent on them and their higher fees as the value of domestic tuition fees falls. The study, which focuses on the cohort of international students who started higher education in the UK in 2021/22, estimates that each of the UK’s 650 parliamentary constituencies is £58m better off as a result of them, equivalent to approximately £560 per citizen. International students studying in Glasgow, London, Sheffield, Nottingham and Newcastle are among those to deliver the greatest financial boost, according to the report. Even when taking into account dependants and the cost to public services, which it estimates at £4.4bn, the study says international students are a huge net contributor to the UK economy, providing a total net benefit of £37.4bn. Dr Gavan Conlon, partner at London Economics, said international students put nearly 10 times more into the economy than they take out, boosting both local and national economic wellbeing. “International students also allow universities to undertake world-class teaching and research that would not otherwise be possible.” Hepi director Nick Hillman added: “If there were to be further changes to the rules on international students, then it is vital that these are based on evidence rather than whim. So this report is designed to strengthen the existing evidence base.” Mark Corver, director of DataHE, said: “This type of analysis, with generous economic multipliers on tuition fees and rents paid, will inevitably generate startling large figures for economic benefit. “Similar calculations for UK students, particularly if it took into account their longer duration post-graduation work, would likely generate even larger figures for ‘impact’ on the economy.”</body>

    <head>Australian government threatens tougher regulation as eSafety commissioner decries Twitter’s ‘sewer rats’</head>
    <body>The Australian government would consider a tougher crackdown on Twitter if the company fails to comply with online safety laws and takedown notices, the communications minister has said. In February, Michelle Rowland wrote to Twitter’s vice-president for trust and safety, Ella Irwin, expressing concern over the axing of the company’s Australian presence after billionaire Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform. Her concerns centred on the impact it would have for government agencies and law enforcement communicating with the company. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Guardian Australia can reveal that Rowland has never received a response from Twitter, and said on Tuesday that the government did not rule out more regulation of the company. Related: Elon Musk wants Tesla hires cleared by him as he shifts focus away from Twitter “I could not be clearer that we do not rule out the potential for further regulation in this area, or at least enforcement of the existing regulatory regime, in the event that they are failing to live up to the expectations of industry.” The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said local contacts for dealing with law enforcement issues, such as takedown notices for image-based abuse or bullying, had disappeared. Nobody really wants to be on a platform that feels toxic eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant She said those who had been suspended under the old regime had had their accounts reinstated since Musk had taken over the website, and the “anything goes” approach to moderation had made Twitter toxic. She said that is why she believes people are abandoning the service. “You let sewer rats and you let all these people who’ve been suspended back on the platform, while you get rid of the trust-and-safety people and processes and those who are really dedicated people, who look at terrible content and the worst of humanity every day … and think you’re going to get a better, more engaging product that protects the brand is pretty crazy,” she said. “And of course, brands are walking with their feet and people aren’t signing up for Twitter Blue. Nobody really wants to be on a platform that feels toxic or feels unsafe.” The eSafety commissioner issued several platforms, including Twitter, with legal notices earlier this year, requiring the companies to explain how – under the basic online safety expectation regulations – they are tackling child abuse material on their platforms, and preventing their algorithms from amplifying it. Inman Grant said the regulatory process was still under way, and she would be able to comment more on Twitter once that process was complete. Last week Twitter was forced to disable auto-suggestions in its search functionality after users reported cat and dog torture being suggested as search terms, and gruesome videos appearing in the search results. Twitter no longer has a press department. Questions sent to the company’s former email address received an auto-reply of the poop emoji. Inman Grant wrote to Musk in November last year raising similar concerns but never received a response. Her office told the Senate that a Twitter representative said the company was committed to complying with laws and protecting users from harm. In the federal budget, the Albanese Labor government quadrupled the funding allocation for the eSafety commissioner’s office over the next four years to $132.1m – taking the annual funding allocation from $10.3m a year to $42.5m. Related: ‘The Velvet Hammer’: who is Twitter’s new CEO and can she fix its problems? The funding will be used to allow the office to respond more quickly to the rise in reports of online abuse. Inman Grant said on Tuesday that reports had continued to rise year-on-year, but victims of image-based abuse had shifted from majority women to 84% young men. She said attacks on the trans community were also on the rise. “We need to be on the front foot in terms of understanding what different communities are experiencing and how it’s being experienced and to apply our resources accordingly to help those that are being most targeted.”</body>

    <head>Scientists warn Maugean skate, Tasmania’s ‘thylacine of the sea’, one extreme weather event from extinction</head>
    <body>Scientists have warned an ancient fish species that has survived since the time of the dinosaurs could be one extreme weather event from extinction after its population crashed by nearly half in seven years. The Maugean skate, described by marine scientists as a “thylacine of the sea”, is found only in Macquarie Harbour, a vast body of water on Tasmania’s remote west coast. Studies have found its numbers have fallen sharply over the past decade as its environment has been degraded by human influence, including from salmon farming pollution, hydro power stations altering upstream river flows and rising harbour temperatures due to the climate crisis. Related: Failure to protect nature is a bigger threat to humanity than inflation, Australian scientists warn These factors had contributed to a sharp drop in dissolved oxygen levels, which particularly affect survival rates in young skates. The number of surviving Maugean skate is not clear, but an interim monitoring report estimated the population had slumped by 47% between 2014 and 2021. The decline is believed to have been hastened by an extreme event in 2019 – an “inversion” in which the water column was overturned by a westerly storm, lifting poorly oxygenated water from the harbour floor nearer to the surface. “Widespread mortalities” were found among electronically tracked skates after the event. Scientists from the University of Tasmania said it showed rapid action was needed to prevent the species’ extinction, including funding for a captive breeding program to create an “insurance population” outside the harbour. The Australian environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has set a goal of zero extinctions for the country’s plants and animals. The health of Macquarie Harbour plummeted over the last decade after significant expansion of salmon farming nearby. Photograph: Dave Moreno “It’s incredibly urgent because it would just take one event like we’ve seen and we may not be able to do anything [to prevent extinction],” Dr Jayson Semmens, a biologist with the university’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (Imas), said. The leader of the monitoring program, Dr David Moreno, said few juveniles were coming through to keep the population viable. “What’s happened is that in the past 10 years or so we have seen a massive decline in dissolved levels of oxygen deep in the harbour; that hasn’t improved and it’s now chronic,” he said. “We risk losing an important species.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The scientists called for a curb on activities managed by the Tasmanian government that could affect the skate, including fish farms, recreational fishing and changes in river flow from upstream dams. They also said funding was needed to extend the monitoring project, which began in 2012 and is due to end this year. The health of Macquarie Harbour, an area about six times larger than Sydney Harbour, plummeted last decade after a significant expansion of salmon farming was approved in 2012 despite warnings of potential impact on marine life. The cap on fish farm production was later lowered back to near pre-expansion levels. The health of some species improved, but oxygen levels did not rebound. Interactive The Maugean skate lives to about 10 years of age, mostly in a layer of brackish water between 7.5 and 12.5 metres deep between surface freshwater that flows from the Gordon and King rivers and saline bottom water from the Southern Ocean. It was discovered in Bathurst Harbour, in Tasmania’s deep south-west, in 1988, but only four specimens were seen there and none since 1992. A DNA study last year suggested the species was likely now restricted to Macquarie Harbour.

The Tasmanian Inquirer reported that Dr Neville Barrett, a Imas marine scientist, last year told a public event that he believed the species was likely to be extinct within a decade on its current trajectory. The federal government’s threatened species scientific committee will assess next month if the skate should be listed as critically endangered, up from endangered, after receiving a submission from conservation groups. It was included last year on a list of 110 priority species for government action over the next decade. Dr Leonardo Guida from the Australian Marine Conservation Society says the Maugean skate is being ‘choked to death in its home’. Photograph: Jane Ruckert The Australian Marine Conservation Society and Humane Society International called on the government to do “everything in its power” to avoid an extinction. Dr Leonardo Guida, from the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the species had “been around since Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the Earth” but was now being “choked to death in its home”. “Tasmania is home to Australia’s most infamous extinction, that of the thylacine or Tasmanian tiger,” he said. “Does the state really want the ignominy of hosting the world’s first extinction of a shark or ray in modern times due to human activity?” A spokesperson for Plibersek said Labor did not accept extinctions as inevitable, “unlike the previous government”. “It’s important we do what we can to understand the threats to species and use the most-up-to-date advice to better protect them,” the spokesperson said. The Tasmanian government referred questions about the study to the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environment. A department spokesperson said it provided substantial support for research into the skate and was working with stakeholders on its conservation.</body>

    <head>New Zealand ponders bid to host 2025 Rugby League World Cup with Australia</head>
    <body>New Zealand is weighing up the possibility of stepping in to co-host the 2025 Rugby League World Cup, with Australia saying it is “ready for any situation” over the next few years. Plans for the quadrennial tournament were thrown into turmoil on Tuesday when France pulled out of hosting duties amid concerns in the country over the financial viability of the event. It leaves the International Rugby League scrambling to find a new host with just over two years to go before kick-off, or face the possibility of postponing the tournament until 2026. Related: 2025 Rugby League World Cup in doubt after France pull out of staging event The New Zealand Rugby League on Tuesday expressed interest in taking over from France alongside Australia, as the two nations did in 2017. “We are exploring the possibility of a southern hemisphere RLWC as an alternative to France 2025,” the New Zealand Rugby League chief executive, Greg Peters, said. “We’re keen to work with ARLC to host the tournament in New Zealand and Australia and have started the conversations. “Bringing the international tournament down under is an exciting proposition not only for the fans but our Indigenous and Pasifika communities.” The NRL chief executive, Andrew Abdo, would not be drawn on whether Australia would throw its hat into the ring, but admitted the Australian Rugby League Commission had been prepared for the French bid to run into problems. “In terms of World Cups, it’s a bit premature to talk about that, but needless to say we’ll be ready for any situation that unfolds over the next couple of years,” Abdo said at the NRL’s Indigenous round launch on Tuesday. “I’ve been across the issues for a while now. France 2025 was alway going to be a great opportunity for us to grow the game in Europe and particularly in France, but it wasn’t without challenge or risk and it required a few things to go the way of IRL. “It’s too premature to comment on just exactly what we do next. But having said that we have been anticipating some of the challenges and we are working on mitigation plan to make sure international content is played over the next five years. “Beyond the Rugby League World Cup in 2025, the commission and everyone in the game is really united around how we revive and invest in international football. “It’s disappointing for us not to have the certainty of France 2025. But having said that we believe in international football and we believe in a five-year plan to really grow international football “If we’re not playing a World Cup in France there are plenty of other really good opportunities to showcase our game.” Any new host nation would be the third to have been awarded hosting rights for the next edition of international rugby league’s biggest event. France was in the frame after the US and Canada, the original co-hosts, withdrew in 2018, ending plans to take the tournament out of Europe and Oceania for the first time. France announced its own withdrawal after the French government’s demands for a guarantee over the economic viability of the event were unable to be met. Troy Grant, the chair of the IRL, said the tournament in France “was always an ambitious project” but the impact of the economic crisis meant the bid team were unable to satisfy the government’s strict conditional benchmarks. Related: Australian rugby’s ‘code war’ is little more than a Punch and Judy show for public titillation | Angus Fontaine “I respect the French government’s decision amid the challenges they are facing but I can’t hide my disappointment,” Grant said. “Despite our focus having been on France, we will now accelerate our consideration of other contingency options.” France will still host the 2023 rugby union World Cup later this year. The IRL will now convene at a board meeting to consider alternatives to France 2025, which was to be the biggest in the tournament’s history. Sixteen teams were expected to play across 40 venues in the men’s competition, with women’s, wheelchair and youth events also included. Australia, the 12-time and reigning world champions after beating 2021 hosts England, last hosted a World Cup in 2017, along with New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. The trans-Tasman rivals have co-hosted three times since the tournament’s inception in 1954, with Australia involved in a total of six events.</body>

    <head>Country diary: Here, at least, martins and swallows are abundant</head>
    <body>Just off the main square in this southern Alentejo town is a post office of semicircular shape. It’s an attractive structure somewhat resembling a tiered wedding cake, and at the point where its curved front meets the first flat, tiled roof is a series of protruding brick supports. Into the 10 alcoves framed by these and spanning no more than six metres of the whole facade, house martins have inserted roughly 200 of their little mud-brick houses. Scores of the chattering labourers fly in and out of their works to present to any passing observer a glorious, ever-changing weave of blue-and-white flight lines. We were far from the only people to stop and admire this beautiful, kinetic sculpture, yet it’s also the most densely packed subcolony of this species I’ve seen in my life. ‘We were far from the only people to stop and admire this beautiful, kinetic sculpture.’ Photograph: Mark Cocker In the whole town there must be many hundreds, if not thousands, of both swallows and martins breeding. A nearby water tower, within sight of the town square, supports a further 50 nests. A tiny arched entrance to Castro Verde’s market ground had 11 nests clustered round a single light fitting. This alone is possibly more pairs than breed now in my Derbyshire home town of Buxton. Given the catastrophic loss of house martins across all Britain (about half have disappeared since 1970), Castro Verde serves as a powerful reminder of what we’ve lost, but it may also illustrate one reason why we’ve lost them. Not everyone can put up with the mud nests above and the ha’p’orth of mess below, and people routinely discourage them. Before getting dewy-eyed about a contrasting deep tolerance shown by the Portuguese for these fabulous birds, I should add that around the town square, many buildings had fine metal spikes protruding at the point where house martins customarily build. I suspect, however, that the birds have found a way around this by adding more mud cells on top of a first layer of nests, sometimes two or three deep, the spikes therefore having no impact. For now, both birds and people are getting along just fine and, surely, to their mutual benefit. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary</body>

    <head>Dragons face significant overhaul if club is to emerge from NRL mediocrity</head>
    <body>St George Illawarra have sacked head coach Anthony Griffin after a dire two-and-a-half season tenure. It started with the tepid enthusiasm a recycled coach typically brings and ended with a long march to the inevitable, marked by bizarre selection decisions and mounting losses. The writing was on the wall for Griffin when the club announced in mid-March that it would undertake an open interview process for the head coaching role in 2024. Griffin would be welcome to reapply for the job – a highly unusual decision to search for a new coach without officially putting a line through the incumbent. Related: Kevin Sinfield carries Rob Burrow over the line at Leeds Marathon The Dragons opened the season with a home win over the Titans but a second half capitulation against the Broncos a week later saw the dominos begin to fall. In his final nine games, Griffin’s Dragons posted just a single win. Six straight defeats, including a humiliating 42-22 loss to North Queensland in Ben Hunt’s 300th game, proved too much for the Dragons board. Griffin went 22-36 in his 58 games with St George Illawarra. Under his tutelage, the Dragons finished 11th and 10th and he leaves with the team anchored in 16th spot. Such a mediocre return continues the underwhelming seven seasons Paul McGregor had at the helm. Recycled coaches – those on their second or later job who have not achieved any premiership success – rarely succeed in turning around the fortunes of a club. History has not been kind to Griffin either, with the Broncos reaching the grand final the year after his four-season run at the Broncos ended and the Panthers reaching three deciders, winning two premierships, in the four years after he was sacked by Penrith. In his first season in charge, the Dragons had their worst defensive season in their history, conceding 25.67 points per game. Defence is the biggest indicator of success and it did not get notably better with the Dragons conceding 23.7 in 2022 and 25.5 this year. Culture problems and a lack of player development marked his tenure, leaving the Saints no better off than before his arrival. The Dragons after the weekend’s defeat to the Cowboys. Photograph: Ian Hitchcock/Getty Images In his inaugural season at the helm, 13 players breached NRL biosecurity protocols and NSW state government public health orders by attending a party. A year later only three players attended the club’s presentation night. Only last week one of the club’s highest-paid players, Jack Bird, declared “fans don’t know much about footy”. Griffin’s recruitment of veterans and an inability to develop young talent has also caused significant angst at the club. From the get-go it was clear he felt more comfortable around more seasoned players, while at the same time exciting fullback Tyrell Sloan spent most of 2022 playing NSW Cup and Jayden Sullivan received precious little time in 2023. Griffin refused to discuss his decision to drop centre Zac Lomax with the player. The club is not without fault. They have been comparatively absent in their oversight. They have not been particularly modern in their thinking. They have been distant, most recently in the reported failure of any board member or senior executive to attend a function celebrating Hunt’s milestone. The recent history of poor hiring decisions also rests squarely on the shoulders of the Dragons board and front office. And tendencies towards insularity, familiarity and conservatism again seem to be coming to the fore. Across the last 20 years, the Dragons have had five head coaches. Three were assistants within the club who had also played for the team. One was the recycled Griffin. Wayne Bennett, who delivered the 2010 premiership, was the only real swing-for-the-fences hire. It has become clear over the last two decades that the Dragons prefer to hire those with strong ties to the club without giving much heed to arguably more qualified outsiders. Jason Ryles is heavily favoured to be offered the role with Dean Young and Ben Hornby the only other two to be seriously linked to the job. All three played 150-plus games for the Red V. The Dragons denied a report that former Wallabies coach Michael Cheika had been in talks while the likes of Des Hasler, Michael Maguire, Geoff Toovey and Shane Flanagan – grand final coaches over the last decade not currently in head coach roles – have not been courted, at least publicly. The Dragons have been mired in mediocrity since Bennett left the club at the end of the 2011 season. The time afforded Griffin was at best a waste and at worst a setback for the club, which now faces another significant roster overhaul and major cultural change. The most effective way to change the trajectory of a club is to hire a visionary coach who understands the entirety of the role, has learned both from the best and on their own, and who has significant defensive credentials. If the Saints are to change their flight path, the time is now and the blueprint exists. Whether they take advantage is another question entirely.</body>

    <head>US imports of ‘blood teak’ from Myanmar continue despite sanctions</head>
    <body>Thousands of tons of timber from Myanmar have continued to be imported into the US, despite government sanctions against the country’s state-run timber company, a new report from a watchdog environmental advocacy group has revealed. According to the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), over 3,000 tons of timber from Myanmar have been imported into the US over the lpst two years. Teak, prized for its natural water resistance in the building of luxury yachts, furniture and flooring, has been a controversial material for years because of deforestation in Myanmar. After a military coup that took over the democratic civilian government in February 2021, the US levied sanctions against military leaders and military-controlled companies, including the state-controlled Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE), the only company in the country allowed to harvest and sell timber for export. Related: Revealed: how world’s biggest fossil fuel firms ‘profited in Myanmar after coup’ US federal law, under the Lacey Act, requires that imports of wildlife, fish or plants must be legally harvested under the exporting country’s laws. In 2014, a Myanmar law was passed under the former government that banned exports of raw timber – though it allowed exports of milled timber – to curb deforestation. But the EIA has warned the military-controlled government is likely not following the law, and the country is on track to lose its forests by 2035. Deforestation is in addition to the violence of the Myanmar regime, which has so far killed 3,490 people, including at least 363 children, in crackdowns against pro-democracy protesters. The United Nations has condemned the military regime for “grave human rights violations”, including the torture and execution of activists. In April, the regime conducted a series of deadly airstrikes on civilians, killing more than 100. “By closing their eyes to the brutality of the military regime, both traders and those consuming teak for their yachts and floors are supplying much needed hard currency to a junta bankrupting the nation, supporting ever-increasing criminality within the country and enabling corruption,” the EIA report reads. The report names the top 12 US-based companies that have imported teak from Myanmar since the start of the coup. Two companies, East Teak Fine Hardwoods and J Gibson McIlvain, have what the group says is a duopoly on Myanmar teak imports in the US, making up 88% of all teak imports over the past two years with more than 1,600 tons of imports combined. The companies did not respond to requests for comment from the EIA or the Guardian. J Gibson McIlvain said the company has relationships with mills and exporters, allowing it to know where the timber is coming from. “It is important to us to know where our teak wood comes from and how it was harvested for sustainability reasons, but also to comply with government regulations,” the company said on its website. Many US companies that import teak from Myanmar use what is called the “stockpile narrative”, the EIA says, in which companies say the teak was harvested and bought from other Myanmarese companies, which themselves bought the teak from MTE before the coup in February 2021. The EIA says the chance that legal timber harvested and sold before the coup being mixed with illegal timber “is extremely high”. And, it says, the idea that there is still timber in the legal “stockpile” exported from the country “is highly dubious”. While the US sanctioned MTE for its ties to the military regime, the EIA argues that any teak from Myanmar that is traded today financially benefits the regime since MTE not only controls all teak trading, but the regime also charges a fee for all containers that leave Myanmar’s ports. The EIA said that trade data ultimately shows “no major impact on the trade of Myanmar teak into the US”. “Instead, trade has continued at the same levels as before the coup, with the fourth quarter of 2022 seeing some of the biggest monthly imports since the time leading up to and after February 2021,” the report said. In response to sanctions and ethical concerns, teak importers have turned to third-party verification companies that follow the history of lumber products, from harvest to export. But the report questions the authenticity of such verification as the companies claim to use DNA samples from trees to determine exactly when a tree was felled. For such testing to be accurate, samples from teak trees in conflict regions would be required, access to which is limited. The group argues the only way to ensure that US consumers are not directly or indirectly supporting the military regime in Myanmar is to ban the import of any teak from the country, not just teak bought from MTE – a step taken by the EU in 2021 – and to have stricter enforcement. It noted that the US justice department in April created a timber interagency working group that aims to strengthen timber enforcement, with a particular focus on climate impacts. “Without action, it’s no wonder US-based traders blithely continue to import Myanmar’s blood teak when they know there will be no consequences for them,” said EIA forests campaign leader Faith Doherty in a statement. “That is not acceptable.”</body>

    <head>Jimmy Lai: editors from around the world call for release of Hong Kong media mogul</head>
    <body>More than 100 journalists and editors have signed an open letter calling for the immediate release of Jimmy Lai, a British media mogul detained in Hong Kong on national security charges. Leading global media figures including the Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and Nobel peace prize winner Maria Ressa called for the charges against Lai and other journalists in Hong Kong to be dropped. Lai, who is 75 and was first arrested in 2020, is the founder and publisher of Apple Daily, a liberal newspaper that was forced to close in 2021 after the Chinese Communist party cracked down on pro-democracy protests. A longtime critic of the party, Lai is now one of the most high-profile activists in Hong Kong to have been arrested since the Chinese government imposed a sweeping national security law on the territory in 2020. Lai was charged with violating the national security law in August 2020. His trial for that case is scheduled for September, but since his arrest he has been convicted on separate charges of fraud and organising illegal protests – charges that his supporters say are politically motivated. Related: Hong Kong passes law to limit work of foreign lawyers amid ongoing Jimmy Lai case The signatories to the letter, which was organised by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said: “We, as publishers and editors of news media organisations from around the world, are united in support of Apple Daily founder and publisher Jimmy Lai, and his fight for media pluralism and press freedom in Hong Kong. “Jimmy Lai has stood for these values his entire life … In a tremendous act of courage, he chose to stay in Hong Kong and continued to publish as long as he could, despite the severe crackdown taking place around him.” Hong Kong is ranked 140th out of 180 countries in RSF’s 2023 World Press Freedom Index, down from 58th place 10 years ago. In March, Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, Lai’s international lawyer, said the tactics used by Hong Kong’s authorities amounted to “lawfare” – the use of legal mechanisms to suppress opposition – citing the fraud conviction as a tool to smear Lai’s character. On 11 May Hong Kong passed a law allowing authorities to ban foreign lawyers from working on national security cases, as a means of preventing Lai from engaging Tim Owen, a UK barrister, in his coming trial. Lai’s supporters have also criticised the UK government for not doing enough to advocate for Lai’s release. Last week Sebastian Lai, the elder Lai’s son, said the UK government was “incredibly weak” for failing to call for the release of his father. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said it had “regularly” brought its concerns to Chinese and Hong Kong authorities, including the foreign secretary raising Lai’s case at the UN Human Rights Council in February. “We have made clear our strong objection to China’s imposition of the national security law in Hong Kong, which is being used in a deliberate attempt to target and silence pro-democracy figures, including Jimmy Lai,” the spokesperson said.</body>

    <head>Daniel Andrews rules out replacing stamp duty with an annual tax in Victoria</head>
    <body>The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has rebuffed calls to scrap stamp duty in favour of a broad-based land tax in Victoria, but flagged changes to planning laws in an effort to boost housing supply. Stamp duty is now being examined by the Department of Treasury and Finance as well as by a parliamentary inquiry, chaired by non-government MPs. Experts told the inquiry last week that the tax is deepening the state’s housing affordability crisis. But Andrews said he was “unconvinced” that replacing stamp duty with an opt-in land tax – similar to the system operating in New South Wales – will benefit Victorians. “I’m not entirely certain that it is everything that people make it out to be. You had a policy decision made in NSW, then when it got implemented it went from being a compulsory scheme with all these macro benefits … [to] an optional scheme,” Andrews told reporters on Tuesday.

We must stop nimbys weaponising heritage laws to block affordable housing | Katie Roberts-Hull “I don’t know they necessarily get all of that aggregated benefit if it’s not happening everywhere.” The NSW Labor government has committed to repealing the annual land tax. However, the Victorian opposition and state Greens MPs said they are open to supporting abolishing stamp duty in favour of such a tax. Andrews said while “everybody would like to pay less stamp duty”, it helps fund essential public services, including wages for teachers, nurses and police. “It’s not quite as easy as, ‘We don’t like that particular revenue measure, let’s just get rid of it,’” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup According to a pre-election budget update the government will collect an annual average of $8.4bn in stamp duty over the next four years, down on the record $10.4bn haul it received in 2021/22. The budget update warned revenue from stamp duty and land tax was subject to “unique risks and historically has been volatile”, due to the fluctuations of the housing market. The parliamentary inquiry last week heard from experts who said stamp duty was inefficient and an unstable source of revenue for state. The Grattan Institute’s economic policy program director, Brendan Coates, said in a submission that stamp duty “penalise[s] young people” and is a “de facto tax on divorce” that is particularly hurting separated women.

Can cohabiting reduce the burden of Australia’s housing crisis? | Josh Lourensz He argued replacing it with general property taxes could “make Victoria up to $5bn a year better off while also improving housing affordability”. Matthew Kandelaars, from the Urban Development Institute of Australia, wrote that couples with no children on a moderate income “cannot feasibly purchase a median property in metropolitan Melbourne”. “The cost of housing, including the added cost of land transfer duties, partnered with a historic lack of supply, has pushed potential first home buyers out of the housing market and back into the rental market,” he wrote. In Victoria, first home buyers currently receive an exemption from stamp duty for properties valued under $600,000 and a reduced rate charged for properties worth up to $750,000. From July, the NSW government will lift its stamp duty exemptions to include first home buyers who purchase properties for under $800,000.

He also flagged reform to the planning laws, to be introduced later this year, to boost housing supply. This could include introducing incentives for developer to “embed affordable housing in each of the new developments that they make”. “More housing means lower prices,” he said. “It’s really hard to plan for the future … if you’re not in a position to be able to secure housing at a reasonable price proximate to where you would like to live.” Andrews also announced a review of the Domestic Building Contracts Act to ensure Victorians building homes are better protected, after the Porter Davis collapse.</body>

    <head>Picasso: ‘quite adorable’ dog in ‘wonderful red bow’ discovered in painting</head>
    <body>A depiction of a dog has been discovered underneath layers of paint in an early Pablo Picasso masterpiece, more than 120 years after it was first created. The animal was hidden underneath a patch of dark paint in Le Moulin de la Galette, completed by the Spanish artist when he was 19 years old in 1900. It was discovered recently when experts used modern imaging technology on the painting, revealing a brown dog wearing a red bow around its neck. Related: Italian land artist makes world’s largest Picasso portrait with tractor The painting is on display at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, as part of an exhibition about the painter’s formative years in Paris. Julie Barten, senior paintings conservator at the Guggenheim Museum, told Reuters she had always had “a strong feeling that there was something under there”. “What we know is that in many instances, Picasso painted aspects of the composition and then subsequently obliterated them and transformed them into other compositional elements. This was really part of his practice,” she said. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning She likened the dog to a “lingering ghost”, pointing out that viewers can see it with the naked eye if they look closely enough. “There’s red paint showing through in areas and if you look really closely you can see the eyes and the ears. You can see that, when concealing it, he actually left the contour of the head still visible,” she said. Megan Fontanella, the museum’s modern art curator, said that she still found the discovery surprising. “It completely changes how one would have encountered this picture,” she added. “You would have seen this really quite adorable dog in the foreground, looking almost directly at the visitor with this wonderful red bow. One can only speculate why Picasso would have concealed this. But certainly now my eye is drawn to all these wonderful figures in the composition.” Over the years, researchers have discovered multiple hidden paintings in works from Picasso’s “blue period” between 1900 and 1904, including a woman’s face under The Old Guitarist, a nude portrait of a crouching woman underneath The Blind Man’s Meal and even a whole landscape underneath The Crouching Beggar.</body>

    <head>Six people dead and 11 missing in New Zealand fire – as it happened</head>
    <body>4.11am BST We’ll be closing this blog shortly. Our full story on the fire is here: Related: New Zealand hostel fire: at least six dead and 11 missing in Wellington blaze 4.09am BST Summary Here is what we know so far about the fire that broke out at the Loafers Lodge hostel in Wellington, New Zealand: At least six people are dead after a “worst nightmare” fire at a 92-room hostel in New Zealand’s capital, Wellington. The hostel was reportedly at or near capacity. Authorities expect the death toll to rise, as 11 people are unaccounted for, though the hospital was home to many shift workers, so some residents may not have been there. The hostel was home to a number of shift workers, elderly people, health workers and people in vulnerable housing conditions, according to residents, advocates, and the local health board. Emergency services are determining how to access parts of the building, which have collapsed or might otherwise be dangerous to enter, in order to look for bodies. Brendon Nally, the Deputy National Commander of New Zealand’s Fire and Emergency services, said, “The building is quite significantly damaged,” and that parts of the roof had collapsed. The Loafers Lodge caught alight overnight, prompting an evacuation at the four-storey hostel in the southern Wellington suburb of Newtown. Around 90 emergency personnel responded to the blaze, which was doused around sunrise on Tuesday. Aerial trucks winched five people to safety. Police have urged anyone with information around the whereabouts of occupants to come forward. “This is a major event,” New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said. “We’ve not seen something on this scale in recent times. Australia’s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, described the fire as a “dreadful human tragedy” and offered Australia’s help. People living and working close to the building were warned to keep their windows and doors closed to limit their exposure to the fire – they should also turn their air conditioning off and avoid touching materials from the fire, because of the asbestos risk. But the “health effects from asbestos released from fires is generally considered low risk,” RNZ reported. New Zealand’s Chief Coroner, Judge Anna Tutton, warned that identifying victims would take time. In a statement she said, “The identification of people who have died in a fire can be a complex and time-consuming process. It is critical that that identification process is conducted properly and that no mistakes are made,” she said. The hostel building recently passed a fire inspection. New Zealand’s Housing Minister, Megan Woods, says the hostel building passed a fire inspection conducted in February this year. “This building complied with all its obligations that it needed to fulfill as a building as recently as early this year - it was inspected in February, and issued with its BWOF on the third of March,” said Woods. 3.46am BST Hostel building recently passed fire inspection New Zealand’s Housing Minister, Megan Woods, says the hostel building passed a fire inspection conducted in February this year. “Under the Building Act, a building such as this was not required to have sprinklers,” Wood told RNZ. “So this building complied with all its obligations that it needed to fulfill as a building as recently as early this year - it was inspected in February, and issued with its BWOF on the third of March.” 3.21am BST The New Zealand Professional Firefighters Union has said its firefighters are “devastated” by this morning’s events and will not be speaking to media. In a comment reported by the New Zealand Herald, a union spokesperson said: “Out of respect for the deceased and injured their loved ones, and the devastating impact this fire has had on the responding firefighters and 111 emergency call centre operators the NZPFU will not be making any media statements at this time. The firefighters are devastated,” they said. 3.01am BST New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins has again expressed his condolences, writing on Instagram, “This morning I went and thanked the Fire and Emergency crews attending the tragic event at Loafers Lodge in Wellington. Alongside our other first responders they have done an amazing job in horrific circumstances. I know the whole of New Zealand appreciates their bravery and their service. Our thoughts are with the victims of this terrible tragedy and their families.” 2.56am BST Here are some pictures from the scene: Firefighters rinse off after a fire at Loafers Lodge on 16 May 2023 in Wellington, New Zealand.

Photograph: Masanori Udagawa/AP 2.50am BST Deportee advocate Filipa Payne has told RNZ that there were a number of 501 deportees staying in the lodge, not all of whom are accounted for. 501 deportees are people who have had their Australian resident visas cancelled and have been sent back to New Zealand. “I don’t believe they are all accounted, I believe from my information that there is one, possibly two, that are unaccounted for,” Payne told RNZ. “These are people who have been through a lot of trauma and have been really displaced in this country and stuck in accommodation because they were vulnerable and had nowhere else to go.” Updated at 2.51am BST 2.27am BST Nurses all accounted for – local media We reported earlier that nurses were staying in the hostel when a fire broke out. Stuff.NZ reports that they are now all accounted for, according to an unnamed source, and none are injured. 2.25am BST In a statement, police have asked people who were staying in the hostel or are looking for someone who was to contact them – “Police are using these reports, as well as other information from our community partners, to help determine who was in the building at the time and ensure their welfare,” they said. The police added that there would be an update this afternoon on their progress: Police are urging people who were staying in Loafers Lodge on Adelaide Road, Newtown in Wellington in recent days and are safe, or anyone concerned for someone, to please get in touch with Police. They are asked to call 105 and reference Operation Rose, or go online to https://www.police.govt.nz/use-105#online-report-options and select the form “Something Else”, referencing Operation Rose. Police are using these reports, as well as other information from our community partners, to help determine who was in the building at the time and ensure their welfare. We are aware of information circulating relating to number of deceased and number of unaccounted for, however, until more is known Police will not be in a position to confirm numbers. Police will provide an update on progress to date this afternoon. Updated at 2.25am BST 2.11am BST Identifying victims can be &apos;complex and time consuming&apos; says Chief Coroner New Zealand’s Chief Coroner, Judge Anna Tutton, has released a statement saying, “The identification of people who have died in a fire can be a complex and time-consuming process. It is critical that that identification process is conducted properly and that no mistakes are made,” she said. “Coroners will be working hard with Police to ensure that the victims are identified correctly, to enable them to be reunited with their families as soon as possible. In the meantime, I want to reassure families that those who have died are being treated with respect and dignity by all those involved”. Updated at 2.15am BST 1.53am BST People nearby warned to close doors and windows There are six emergency crews onsite at the moment, RNZ reports, including an Urban Search and Rescue Squad with drone operators and technicians who are assessing the structure in order to try to find a safe way into the building. “Once we’ve gained access to the building following structural integrity process, we will work on mopping up hotspots to allow for the investigation process,” District manager Nick Pyatt says. “At this stage any cause of the fire or any other details around the circumstances of the fire are cannot be confirmed,” Pyatt told RNZ. He also said that people nearby should keep their windows and doors closed to limit their exposure to the fire – they should also turn their air conditioning off and avoid touching materials from the fire, because of the asbestos risk. But the “health effects from asbestos released from fires is generally considered low risk,” RNZ reports. Updated at 2.08am BST 1.45am BST The hostel was mainly “short-long-term accommodation, mainly transient accommodation,” Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has just told RNZ. The government is working on emergency housing for those who have been displaced, she said. Updated at 1.46am BST 1.41am BST Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has opened a Mayoral Relief Fund to accept donations from the public for those affected, Stuff.NZ reports. “In crisis like this the generosity and community spirit of Wellingtonians is on full display and this fund allows us to provide support to people who have lost so much in this devastating fire. “By donating to the Fund, we can ensure that people receive the immediate help they really need at this difficult time,” she said. 1.30am BST Nally just told RNZ, “what we know for a fact is that there is 11 people unaccounted for” but that the number of deceased persons is “not yet confirmed, but yes it is multiple”. 1.27am BST He says emergency services will “take the time we need to be absolutely certain of the cause” of the fire and that it is “too early to comment”. 1.26am BST Emergency services assessing options to access parts of building Brendon Nally, the Deputy National Commander of New Zealand’s Fire and Emergency services, is talking to RNZ. “The building is quite significantly damaged,” he says. There are still parts of the building that firefighters can’t access, he said, but engineers are assessing options. Parts of the roof have collapsed. Updated at 2.05am BST 1.24am BST One resident jumped out of his wondow and down two floors onto a rooftop, he told RNZ. “I was on the top floor and I couldn’t go through the hallway because there was just too much smoke so I jumped out the window,” he said. “It was just scary, it was really scary, but I knew I had to jump out the window or just burn inside the building.” He has been treated for a sprained ankle. 1.19am BST A number of people who work for the local health service were staying at the hostel, the Capital &amp; Coast and Hutt Valley District Health Board told RNZ. The spokesperson was not able to confirm how many of the board’s staff were living there. He said they were working to confirm which staff members were safe. 1.13am BST Fire is a &apos;dreadful human tragedy&apos;, says Australian Prime Minister Australia’s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, has described a hostel fire in the New Zealand capital that claimed multiple lives as a “dreadful human tragedy”. The prime minister said he had spoken with New Zealand counterpart Chris Hipkins following the fire, and offered Australian assistance. “This is a dreadful human tragedy. I expressed my condolences on behalf of Australia to our friends in New Zealand at this very difficult time,” Mr Albanese told reporters in Melbourne. “Any assistance of course will, as always, be available from Australia to New Zealand at what is a very difficult time. Australia’s Trade Minister, Don Farrell, said it was not known whether any Australians were staying at the hostel. “We’re trying to get as many details as we can about what’s happened, and in particular whether any Australians have been involved in this terrible fire,” he said. Updated at 2.05am BST 1.09am BST Summary If you’re just joining us, here is what we know so far: At least six people are dead after a “worst nightmare” fire at a 92-room hostel in New Zealand’s capital, Wellington. Authorities expect the death toll to rise, as 11 people are unaccounted for, though the hospital was home to many shift workers, so some residents may not have been there. Officials were privately bracing for dozens of fatalities earlier on Tuesday but inspector Dean Silvester said police’s initial assessment was that “fewer than 10” had died. The Loafers Lodge caught alight overnight, prompting an evacuation at the four-storey hostel in the southern Wellington suburb of Newtown. Around 90 emergency personnel responded to the blaze, which was doused around sunrise on Tuesday. Aerial trucks winched five people to safety The hostel was reportedly at capacity. Police have urged anyone with information around the whereabouts of occupants to come forward. “This is a major event,” New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said. “We’ve not seen something on this scale in recent times. Updated at 2.13am BST 12.58am BST Loafers Lodge resident Tamrat Isse Ada said he has lost everything except his jacket and phone. He has been living at the lodge for the past year. He happened to be going to the toilet when he realised there was a fire, he told Stuff.NZ. “There was smoke and the alarm was going from upstairs,” he said. “When I come from the toilet there was smelling everywhere, smoke ... people running everywhere. I just jumped to my room, and I take my jacket and my mobile, that’s it.” He escaped down the stairs and out the door. He could see nothing in the dark. “I’m very sad, very sad. My neighbour, he’s missing, maybe he’s dead, police say there’s a lot of people missing. Very sad.” Isse Ada has children in Australia and has spoken to them, he said. Updated at 1.10am BST 12.52am BST RNZ reports that four people were taken to emergency at Wellington Hospital and one was then transferred to a different hospital because of the seriousness of their condition. The three people at Wellington are in a stable condition, RNZ reports. Updated at 1.00am BST 12.48am BST Number of dead still stands at six and is expected to rise Emergency services are still expecting that “up to 10” people have died, Hipkins said. He added that it is expected when crews enter the building that the number will rise. Updated at 1.09am BST 12.43am BST Hipkins described emergency services as arriving to a “confronting” situation. “Obviously, it’s quite confronting and also just to speak to the first responders on the scene in terms of what they dealt with when they arrived in the small hours of the morning, clearly a traumatic situation for them,” he told the media a few minutes ago. “They’ve just had a crew change so some of people who were on the scene at the beginning will get a bit of a break now so I didn’t get a chance to see some of them. They will have already left the site but I want to acknowledge them in particular.” 12.40am BST Marie Murphy, the hostel’s property manager, has described the mix of residents. “We’ve got everyone living there. We have nurses. We’ve had doctors, nurses, unemployed people, meat workers, hospital staff. All sorts of people. A real variety of people,” she told Stuff.NZ. “This is very sad for a lot of people. Not only the ones who’ve lost their lives, but those who’ve lost their homes. “There’s a lot of full time people. A lot have been there longer than I‘ve been there,” Murphy said. “It just feels surreal. It doesn’t feel real. It’s very hard. It was a pretty bad fire. I’m feeling very sad at the moment.” Updated at 1.01am BST 12.35am BST Grant Robertson, New Zealand’s Minister of Finance, said that the hostel was full – we’ve seen other reports that around three beds weren’t booked. “I believe the beds were full last night,” he said. The death toll still stands at six people – there was no update on that figure from Hipkins and Robertson. 12.33am BST Hipkins says he was alerted to the event between 6 and 7 am this morning. “Obviously, my first concern was for the people on the scene here, so the people who potentially were trapped in the building and of course our first responders,” he said. The local MP says a relief fund has been set up. 12.31am BST “This is a major event,” says Hipkins. “We’ve not seen something on this scale in recent times. Wellingtonians will feel this. Wellington is a small community and, you know, particularly here in this community. It’s a very tight-knit community. People will be feeling this today and I think, you know, I know the community will support each other, will give support to each other.” Updated at 1.08am BST 12.29am BST Chris Hipkins is speaking to media now. He says that there will be an investigation into the event. “The police, the coroner, a range of different investigations take place and of course we will follow those and await any findings that come from those,” he said. 12.22am BST Another resident, Simon Hanify, said he knocked on his neighbours’ doors to alert them to the fire. He has lived in the building for five months, and, like the resident we quoted a short while ago, he said that fire alarms would often go off in the building, usually without reason. “When I left my room I could smell smoke in the hallway so I went straight towards the kitchen and there was smoke coming down the stairwell,” he told RNZ. “I just did a lap of our floor saying ‘everyone out, this one’s real’.” He said that residents were unsure of where they would now find accommodation. 12.17am BST Another local resident, Chris Fincham, has told RNZ that fire alarms would regularly go off, but that none sounded during the fire. He knew something was happening when he heard someone shouting from the hallway, he said. “I heard a voice coming down the passageway saying ‘evacuate, evacuate, the place is on fire’ — and I didn’t think much of it because the fire alarms would go off two or three times a week and we’d just ignore it. “But then when I heard this guy, or this person, screaming ‘there’s a fire, evacuate’, I sat there for about five minutes and then I put my shoes on, got my wallet together, and I thought maybe I should leave.” Updated at 12.18am BST 12.10am BST 11 people unaccounted for We have an update now on the number of people still accounted for after a fire at a hostel in Wellington, New Zealand. Brendon Nally, the Deputy National Commander of New Zealand’s Fire and Emergency services, has just told Stuff.NZ, that emergency services are still searching for 11 people. He said firefighters had saved “several dozen” people. 12.06am BST One of the residents of the lodge has said that there were people who were 80 or 90 years old living in the building. A man who gave his name only as Chris told 1Newz he was worried that the building’s elderly residents would have struggled to get out. “I grabbed my hat on the way and just started crawling — it was hard to crawl because there was only that much airspace on the ground,” he said. “For me, it was hard, just that little distance, it was a struggle. You’ve got people in there like 80, 90, who aren’t able to look after themselves, especially in a fire, they will struggle.” 12.03am BST The hostel’s property manager has spoken to New Zealand’s 1News. Marie Murphy told 1News that many of the people who live in the hostel are shift workers. This echoes what Brendon Nally, the Deputy National Commander of New Zealand’s Fire and Emergency services, said a short while ago. While there were 20 people unaccounted for, he said, “That doesn’t mean that they’re all in this building, they would have gone to family and whānau - we know some of them are shift workers, they might still be at work”. 11.57pm BST Wellington Regional Hospital has asked non-urgent patients to stay away today. “Due to the active fire scene in Newtown today, emergency services have closed Adelaide Road between John Street and the Basin Reserve, limiting access to the hospital,” the hospital said. “Patients who have non-urgent and safely-deferrable appointments are being rescheduled. People are asked not to call about appointments as they will be contacted if their appointment is affected”.

Photograph: Marty Melville/AFP/Getty Images 11.45pm BST Authorities said 52 people were taken out of the building after being notified of the blaze at 12.25am. More than 10 fire vehicles responded to the emergency across the morning and the fire was put out after 6am. 11.43pm BST 20 people still unaccounted for It is currently just after 10.30 am in Wellington. An hour ago the Deputy National Commander of New Zealand’s Fire and Emergency services, Brendon Nally, told local media that 20 people were still unaccounted for. He also said that the building did not have a sprinkler system. New Zealand’s building code does not require the retrofitting of sprinkler systems into existing older buildings. He said it wasn’t possible that anyone still in the building could be alive. “We have firefighters who did a fantastic job and have been at every part of the building where someone could be alive,” he told NewstalkZB. It was a “hot, dense” fire, he said. The fire had damaged the structure of the building. “We got as many out as possible. We are dealing with a building with asbestos and partial collapse,” Nally said. “We are being diligent and methodical to deal with this building. The fire spread on all floors one specifically was the worst affected.” Updated at 11.44pm BST 11.35pm BST Greens MP Golriz Ghahraman has tweeted: Aroha and strength Pōneke. Some of our most marginalised are impacted and there will be tough questions but for now, we need to wrap around survivors. So grateful to our incredible tireless first responders. https://t.co/91W4yI1wm7 — Golriz Ghahraman (@golrizghahraman) May 15, 2023 11.30pm BST The hostel has previously been contracted as an emergency housing provider in New Zealand, and where the housing crisis means a growing number of homeless people are housed long-term by the government in motels and hostels, but New Zealand Prime Minister Hipkins said the hostel was “not currently being used as emergency accommodation”. New Zealand Prime Minister Hipkins said the fire was “an absolute tragedy”. “It is a horrific situation. And in the fullness of time of course there’ll be a number of investigations about what has happened and why it happened.” He said the hostel was “not currently being used in emergency accommodation”. “But my understanding is that there will be a number of Ministry of Social Development clients.” It was named by the Ministry of Social Development in a list of emergency housing providers released in 2021. Social service agencies including Wellington City Mission have said they had clients housed in the building, which advertises itself as providing affordable long and short term accommodation. Updated at 11.34pm BST 11.27pm BST New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins told the AM morning news program that he understands that six people have been confirmed dead and there are likely to be more. Police said they don’t yet have an exact count of the number of fatalities, but they believe it’s fewer than 10 people. Hipkins, said at least six people had died. “I understand six confirmed previously and it looks like there are likely to be more.” Hipkins said, “It’s a really concerning development and obviously our thoughts will be with all the firefighters involved and all the victims of the terrible tragedy that’s unfolding.” 11.25pm BST Here is a photo of the fire taken in the early hours of this morning: Adelaide Road is currently closed between John Street and the Basin Reserve due to a fire at a Newtown hostel. pic.twitter.com/25EUZxzevl — Wellington City Council (@WgtnCC) May 15, 2023 11.21pm BST Wellington Fire and Emergency District Manager Nick Pyatt told reporters, “I can sadly report that this will be a multi-fatality incident. Our thoughts at this time are with the families of those who have perished and with our crews who valiantly rescued those (they could) and attempted to rescue those that they couldn’t.” “This is our worst nightmare,” Pyatt said. “It doesn’t get worse than this.” 11.20pm BST Opening summary A fire has broken out at a four-storey hostel in the New Zealand capital, Wellington, leaving at least six people dead, according to PM Chris Hipkins. Police said they don’t yet have an exact count of the number dead, although they believe it’s fewer than 10 people. Emergency services were called to the Loafers Lodge hostel about 12:30am. Wellington Fire and Emergency District Manager Nick Pyatt said 52 people have been accounted for, but that a number still remained unaccounted for, according to Associated Press.

    <head>Woolworths probes shopper’s accusation of racial profiling at Queensland self-checkout</head>
    <body>Woolworths is investigating claims by a shopper that she was racially profiled at a central Queensland store amid growing concerns among the Indigenous community that members are being targeted as local anti-crime sentiment increases. Related: Vigilante fears: Queensland man accused of chasing stolen car had ‘edged weapons’, police say Marilyn, a First Nations woman who asked that her surname not be published, spoke to Guardian Australia after being approached by a staff member at the self-checkout of the store, alleging she had placed chocolates in her pocket and asking if she had paid for them. In a video of the incident, Marilyn responds by denying she had chocolates and telling the staff member to look inside her pockets, emptying them out to prove her point. She says she had only placed her change in there and confirms she has a receipt for goods bought at the store.

We’ve got a receipt for what we paid for.” Marilyn empties her pocket to disprove an accusation of shoplifting at a Woolworths self-checkout. Photograph: Marilyn After being prompted by Marilyn, the staff member does offer an apology to her. A spokesperson from Woolworths said the company was investigating the incident and had attempted to make contact with the customer. “We are concerned about the incident as this is not the shopping experience we aspire to provide. We take customer feedback of this nature very seriously and have commenced an internal investigation,” they said. Marilyn said it was not the first time she’d been accused of stealing but she’d experienced several similar instances in the past few weeks alone. “I have never seen non-Indigenous people getting that same attention,” she said. “I’m glad I got a chance to pull out a camera and show it.” The video comes amid broader concerns about organised vigilante activity in central Queensland in response to local crime, after a mob surrounded the home of an Indigenous teenager in Rockhampton in an unrelated incident. Guardian Australia revealed the ringleader of the group, Torin O’Brien, was previously the national leader of a far-right “patriots” group, which regularly published anti-Islam content online. O’Brien did not respond to a request for comment at the time. Queensland police have repeatedly cautioned against vigilantism, with commissioner Katarina Carroll last week warning it could result in a death. Alwyn Doolan, a Gooreng Gooreng and Wakka Wakka man from the Aboriginal community of Woorabinda, west of Rockhampton, said he had heard of several other incidents involving the Indigenous community over the past few weeks. “There was a woman racially abused in Gracemere, that was going to pick up her daughter from school and had been called out racial names,” Doolan said. “The tensions are high in the community around what the vigilantes are doing but also the fear-mongering [towards] predominantly Indigenous peoples.” First Nations people were often “painted with the same brush” and are weary after being “stereotyped”, he said. Related: Queensland MP cancels meeting with Rockhampton mob leader Torin O’Brien Indigenous community members held a meeting last week to discuss safety concerns after vigilante car patrols. “It’s 2023. It’s way out of line in terms of us moving forward together as a community,” Doolan said. “It doesn’t make any sense, taking law matters into their own hands.”</body>

    <head>‘Impact starts at fibre’: seven designers who are championing regenerative fashion</head>
    <body>~ Much like the term “sustainable”, “regenerative” is increasingly used in vague ways in fashion marketing. For a garment to be truly regenerative, the raw materials must have been farmed without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides using techniques that restore the health of the soil, improve ecosystem functionality, water cycles and biodiversity. Related: Fashion greenwashing glossary: what do ‘circular’, ‘sustainable’ and ‘zero waste’ really mean? A regenerative system provides better outcomes for the farmers and communities along the supply chain. But on a broader scale, regenerative agriculture has been described as integral to the future of fashion. In the industry, the transition to regenerative fibre farming is only just getting under way, meaning regenerative fashion can be hard to find, and often, eye-wateringly expensive – an unfortunate reality of sustainable supply chains as they work to compete with fast-fashion business models. Here are some designers who already have regenerative garments in their collections. Angel Chang Made by indigenous artisans in the mountainous province of Guizhou in China, every garment produced by Angel Chang is regenerative. Her collection is made with native seed cotton that has been grown without chemicals and dyed with locally harvested indigo and gardenia. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Chang says her favourite piece “is literally called my favourite shirt”. The shirt is entirely handmade: the cotton is hand-spun into yarn then woven into fabric on a handloom, while the shirt is hand-stitched together. “The cotton is unprocessed and unbleached – so the oil of the seed is retained on the fibre and keeps the fabric soft,” she says. “By strictly following the traditional processes [of the Miao and Dong ethnic minority grandmothers] we have created clothing with a nearly zero carbon footprint.” A.BCH The A.05 linen shirt from Melbourne-based label A.BCH. Photograph: Supplied by A.BCH Courtney Holm has worked extensively to produce truly low- or positive-impact clothing for her Melbourne-based label A.BCH. The brand’s linen shirt is made from 100% global organic textile standard certified linen, grown in France by a collective of organic-flax farmers. Flax generally grows with minimal irrigation and when farmed without chemical fertilisers and pesticides can be a carbon sink (that is, the flax plants can absorb more CO2 than they emit). The first stage of processing the linen is done locally. Then the fibres are spun into yarn in Hungary and the yarns are sent to Belgium where they’re woven in a carbon neutral mill and whitened with low-impact oxygen whiteners. “Our Belgian linen supplier has been milling linen since 1864 and are recognised by The Masters of Linen,” says Holm. From there, the linen is sent to A.BCH’s Melbourne factory where it’s cut and sown into the A.05 linen shirt, a mainstay of the label’s collection since its launch in 2017. While the shipment of fabric from Europe to Melbourne may seem like a lot of carbon emissions for a low-impact garment, most fabric in the industry travels much further to be converted from raw material to textile, and currently, there is no flax grown and processed in Australia. Another Tomorrow “We believe that impact starts at fibre,” the CEO of New York-based label Another Tomorrow, Vanessa Barboni Hallik, says. Take, for example, the tuxedo jacket, which forms part of her “daily uniform”. The tuxedo jacket from New York-based label Another Tomorrow. Photograph: Supplied The jacket is made with wool from a Responsible Wool Standard certified farm in Victoria, Australia. RWS certification requires farms to uphold the highest standards of animal welfare, so no mulesing is allowed. Farmers must use progressive land management techniques that protect soil health, biodiversity and native species. “We have six farms now in our portfolio across Australia and New Zealand with deep commitments to biodiversity, carbon management and extremely stringent animal welfare standards,” says Barboni Hallik. Maggie Marilyn “We love merino for its temperature-regulating properties, its durability,” says Maggie Hewitt. The New Zealand designer is renowned for integrating the highest standards of sustainability and traceability into her merino knitwear label Maggie Marilyn. Her collection is made with ZQRX certified merino wool – that is, grown in New Zealand by producers whose farming techniques restore waterways, protect native species, offset carbon, and enhance local communities. For Hewitt, the certification is notable for its ambition, and describes it as “a measure beyond sustainability, where the aim is continuous improvement – not a minimum standard.” KitX Kit Willow, the founder of Sydney based clothing label KitX, is a pioneer of sustainable fashion who describes hemp as a fibre of the future. Hemp is an extremely resilient crop that grows with minimal irrigation and without synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. Because of its deep taproot system it can pull toxins from the soil, while research suggests industrial hemp can be twice as effective than trees in sequestering carbon. In the KitX collection, the “hemp tee” is made from a hemp-cotton blend fabric knitted in Melbourne and constructed in Sydney using Citizen Wolf’s zero-waste production technology. Mara Hoffman While Mara Hoffman’s headquarters are in New York, all their wool knitwear and accessories are made using “climate beneficial” wool from Emigh ranch in northern California. Related: Don’t tumble, don’t soften and wash less often: how to save money on laundry The wool is part of a wider regenerative agricultural program by not-for-profit Fibershed. Mara Hoffman’s vice-president of sustainability, produce and business strategy, Dana David, describes the main stakeholders of the initiative as scientists and community organisers who measure how fibre ecosystems adapt to and mitigate climate change. They are focused on giving ranchers and farmers the tools needed to practise carbon farming; and to put in place land stewardship efforts such as prescribed grazing, creating pollinator habitats, restoring creeks and a host of farming techniques known to support healthy soils. “These practices aid in sequestering carbon back into the soil and vegetation, which removes carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, enriches the soil and helps to restore healthy ecosystems,” says David. The wool from these landscapes have been turned into a line of beautiful, soft knitwear for Mara Hoffman’s collection. Joslin The creative director of Melbourne-based label Joslin, Elinor McInnes, is renowned for her love of linen. So much so, Joslin only works with suppliers and textile mills that have received European Flax certification. This ensures a commitment to farming that respects the environment and commits to zero irrigation, non-GMO seed and low waste. She says “[the] linen is a renewable resource, grown from rainwater, that can be produced without damaging the environment.” From the field to the fibre, the production of Joslin’s linen is fully traceable. The combed flax is exported from Europe to a mill in Jiangsu, China where it is spun and woven into batiste cloth.</body>

    <head>Martha Stewart, 81, becomes oldest Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover model</head>
    <body>Martha Stewart has become Sports Illustrated’s oldest cover model ever, posing for the magazine’s annual swimsuit edition at the age of 81. The television personality and cook is one of four cover models for this year’s issue, which aims to celebrate powerful women who “live in a world where they feel no limitations, internally or externally”. The other models were actor Megan fox, model Brooks Nader and musician Kim Petras. “When I heard that I was going to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, I thought: ‘Oh, well that’s pretty good.’ I’m gonna be the oldest person, I think, ever on the cover of Sports Illustrated,’” Stewart said in an interview about the cover. “And I don’t think about age very much, but I thought that this is kind of historic and that I better look really good.” Stewart, who was photographed in the Dominican Republic by Ruven Afanador, was asked what Snoop Dogg, a friend and frequent collaborator, would think of her cover. She laughed and said: “Snoop is going to just think that it is fantastic.” Stewart’s cover shoot means she is now the oldest woman to ever pose for Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue, surpassing Elon Musk’s mother, the model Maye Musk, who posed in 2022 when she was 74. “My motto has always been: ‘when you’re through changing, you’re through,’ so I thought, why not be up for this opportunity of a lifetime?” Stewart wrote on Instagram. “I hope this cover inspires you to challenge yourself to try new things, no matter what stage of life you are in.” Related: Valentina Sampaio becomes first openly trans model in Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue Stewart, deemed the “OG of influencers” by Sports Illustrated, rose to fame in the 1980s when she started to write cookbooks and appear on television after her success as a chef. Since then, Stewart has written 99 books, hosted multiple cooking shows, launched her own lifestyle magazine and released her own lines of clothing, cooking and home products. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “Never in her life has she let her circumstances dictate her outcome,” Sports Illustrated Swimsuit’s editor-in-chief, MJ Day, said of Stewart. “She’s changed with the times – always one step ahead, it seems – to build a wide-reaching business empire.” Petras is just the second trans woman to appear on the Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover, following model Leyna Bloom, who in 2021 also became the first trans person of colour to ever appear in Sports Illustrated. “No matter what your gender or sexuality or any of that stuff is, it’s about what you make of life,” Petras said, in a video about her cover shoot. “It’s about what’s inside of you.”</body>

    <head>Suspect named in baseball bat attack at Democratic congressman’s office</head>
    <body>Police in Virginia on Monday named the suspect in an attack in which two staffers at the district office of a Democratic congressman were assaulted with a metal baseball bat and required hospital treatment. Xuan Kha Tran Pham, 49, was arrested after the attack at Gerry Connolly’s office in Fairfax. Held without bond, Pham faced charges of malicious wounding and aggravated malicious wounding. A man with a metal baseball bat walked into the northern Virginia office on Monday, asked for the congressman, then struck two of his workers with the bat, including an intern in her first day on the job, police and the congressman said. Connolly told CNN one staff member was hit in the head while the other, the intern, was hit on the side. Speaking to the Associated Press, the congressman said: “Both of them are conscious and talking. They’re both in shock. Their families were with them, too.” A police spokesperson, Sgt Lisa Gardner, said police were called at about 10.50am. Connolly was not at the office, Gardner said, adding that some staff members hid during the attack. “You could absolutely tell that the people inside were scared. They were hiding. Someone swinging a bat around, I would be scared as well,” Gardner said. Connolly said the attacker caused widespread damage, shattering glass and breaking computers. He told CNN the man “was filled with out of control rage”. In a statement, Connolly called the attack “unconscionable and devastating”. Acts of political extremism, including attacks on lawmakers, have become increasingly common in the US. Last October, Paul Pelosi, husband of the former Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked in his home in San Francisco by a man armed with a hammer. Afterwards, the Michigan representative Debbie Dingell predicted “somebody is going to die”, telling Axios that two years previously, after the now fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson broadcast a segment about her, she “had men outside my home with assault weapons that night”. The Democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, was the target of a foiled rightwing kidnap plot. Justice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, has complained of an increase in threats to the supreme court. Last year, a man was charged with attempting to kill Brett Kavanaugh, like Alito a member of the 6-3 conservative majority. In April, the US Capitol police chief, Tom Manger, testified in Congress about the heightened threat. “One of the biggest challenges we face today is dealing with the sheer increase in the number of threats against members of Congress – approximately 400% over the past six years,” Manger said. “Over the course of the last year, the world has continuously changed, becoming more violent and uncertain.” On Monday, Connolly told the AP the suspect in the attack on his district office was known to Fairfax police but had “never made threats to us so it was unprovoked, unexpected and inexplicable”. The congressman added: “I have no reason to believe that his motivation was political … but it is possible that the sort of toxic political environment we all live in, you know, set him off, and I would just hope all of us would take a little more time to be careful about what we say and how we say it.” US Capitol police and Fairfax police said the motive remained unclear. It was not immediately clear if the suspect had an attorney. Police said the man was suspected in a separate attack a short time earlier on Monday. A man later identified as Pham approached a woman parked in her car about five miles from Connolly’s office and asked the woman if she was white, then hit her windshield with a bat and ran away, according to police. The woman was not injured. Pham’s father, Hy Pham, told the Washington Post his son was schizophrenic and had dealt with mental illness since his late teens. Hy Pham told the newspaper he had been unsuccessfully trying to arrange mental health care for his son. In May 2022, a person whose name and community of residence matches Xuan Kha Pham’s sued the Central Intelligence Agency in federal court. In a hand-written complaint, the plaintiff alleged the CIA had been “wrongfully imprisoning me in a lower perspective” and “brutally torturing me with a degenerating disability consistently since 1988 till the present from the fourth dimension”. Connolly, 73, has represented the 11th congressional district in Virginia since 2009. A prominent Democrat, he frequently spars with Republicans who control the House. Last week, Connolly criticised CNN’s decision to host Donald Trump for a town hall in New Hampshire, telling Fox News the event was a “travesty”. “Why would you put a liar and a convicted criminal on a town hall?” Connolly asked, adding: “To me, it is frankly reprehensible.” Trump is not a convicted criminal. Last week, in a civil case in New York, he was found liable for sexual assault and defamation against the writer E Jean Carroll. On Monday, Connolly thanked police and emergency medical professionals. His focus, he said, was on ensuring his staff members received “the care they need”. “I have the best team in Congress,” Connolly said. “My district office staff make themselves available to constituents and members of the public every day.” Mark Warner, one of two Democratic senators from Virginia, said: “Intimidation and violence – especially against public servants – has no place in our society. This is an extraordinarily disturbing development.” Jason Miyares, the Republican attorney general of Virginia, wished Connolly’s staffers well and said: “Political violence is always unacceptable. The coward who did this should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor, said: “Violence does not belong in our political system and my prayers are with … Gerry Connolly’s staff for a speedy recovery. We’ve seen this against our judiciary, we’ve seen this against our legislative branch and it has no place in our commonwealth.” But Dan Goldman, a Democratic congressman from New York, linked the attack to remarks by Republicans. “This is horrifying,” Goldman wrote. “From ‘very fine people on both sides’” – which Donald Trump said about violence at a far-right march in Virginia in 2017 – “to calling January 6 a ‘peaceful protest’, there are serious consequences when elected officials refuse to condemn or outright glorify political violence.” “At this time, it is not clear what the suspect’s motivation may have been,” Capitol Police said in a news release announcing a joint investigation with the Fairfax City Police Department. Capitol police threat assessment agents have been sent to Fairfax. Associated Press contributed to this report</body>

    <head>‘Separation is the only answer’: Manipur violence fuels calls for separate state in India</head>
    <body>In towns and villages across India’s north-eastern state of Manipur, some houses have been reduced to ashes while neighbouring properties stand untouched, after an eruption of ethnic violence in which more than 70 were murdered and 30,000 forced to flee. The bloodshed which began on 3 May has mostly abated, but there is little hope of a swift return to normality. Food is scarce; a curfew is still enforced by the army and paramilitary troops; the internet remains suspended; shops, schools and offices are closed; thousands of people remain stranded in crowded and unsanitary refugee camps. And reports of fresh violence over the weekend prompted fresh displacements. “This is a civil war situation,” said John Mamang, a lawyer and relief volunteer in the town of Churachandpur. Related: ‘Everything is gone’: entire Indian villages burned in ethnic violence Shortages of food and medicine are becoming acute, said Mamang, who on Monday was unable to even find rice to donate to a nearby camp. “People are beginning to starve. Some haven’t eaten for two to three days. When I reached the camp, a woman had just delivered a baby, with no medicines or medical help and in the clothes she’d been wearing for five days,” he said. Indian soldiers help evacuate a girl during the ethnic riots in Manipur state. Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images Most of the victims were from the mainly Christian hill tribes such as the Kukis, but members of the mostly Hindu Meitei people were also targeted. And in towns where the two communities once lived warily alongside each other, the idea of a return to such uneasy harmony seems unthinkable after so much violence – when friends and neighbours stood by as men, women and children were killed. “It’s impossible. They can never be our neighbours. Not after what’s happened,” said Alun Singh, a Meitei in Imphal. Moses Varte, a Kuki in Churachandpur, said “separation is the only answer”, adding “This was ethnic cleansing of the hill people. Now we can only feel safe as a minority if we have our own state.” Children play at a temporary shelter in the Leimakhong army cantonment in the north-eastern Indian state of Manipur. Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images Debory Fimsangpui’s home in the region’s capital, Imphal, was burned down by a mob, and she and her family survived only because they happened to be away at the time. “If we had been there, we would not be alive today. But we will not forget those who died, the elderly, those who could not run away,” said Fimsangpui, a college lecturer. The fact that Kukis were targeted in the city – despite the presence of security forces – has for many hill tribe members underlined a sense that they cannot be safe anywhere in the state. “Before, Kukis used to send their children to Imphal for higher studies,” said Fimsangpui. “I have one son, Daleed who is 24. Do you think I would ever send him to Imphal now? We can never trust the Manipur government or the police again.” Interactive The spark for the fuse The states of north-east India – wedged between Bangladesh, China and Myanmar – are a patchwork of ethnic groups, many of them shot through with longstanding enmities. The spark for the latest outbreak of violence in Manipur was a plan to grant the majority Meitei the status of a “scheduled tribe” which would give them access to quotas in government jobs and colleges under India’s affirmative action policy. Tribal leaders say the Meiteis are already better off and dominate the government, police, and civil service. Granting them more privileges would be unfair, the Kukis argue, and would allow the Meiteis access to the forest lands which have been occupied by the tribes for centuries. “The Meities already have Imphal – which has malls, sports centres and big office buildings – while the hill areas have been neglected and received much less investment. For anything important – social, political, educational or medical treatment – all of us Kukis come to Imphal because it is much more developed than the hill areas.” Each group blames the other for the violence. Conspiracy theories abound which have furthered weakened what little trust the Kukis had in the government. Police have been accused of favouring the majority Meitei community. The Kukis evacuated to the safety of army-run camps claimed police did not defend them, or even joined the mobs. Mamang said: “Hill people have seen policemen in uniform leading some of the mobs and torching whole villages. I was away in Churachandpur for work but my home in Imphal was burnt, with my car, electric scooter, my possessions, all my law books. A friend who tried to stop the mob was almost killed. He managed to run away. The government let the mobs have their way, it was complicit.” A Indian soldier stands guard during a curfew at Oinam bazaar of Bishnupur in Manipur. Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images The feeling that there is no going back to an uneasy status quo was reflected in a statement released on Saturday by 10 tribal legislators from the state assembly. They called on New Delhi to create a separate administration for the hill people which could “live peacefully as neighbours with the state of Manipur”. They said that after the carnage, living alongside the Meiteis was “as good as death for our people”. After a meeting in New Delhi with India’s home minister, Amit Shah, on Sunday, Manipur’s chief minister N Biren Singh told journalists on Monday morning: “The territorial integrity of Manipur [would] be protected at all costs.” Local people say there is no chance that the small number of Kukis who once lived in Meitei majority areas will ever return – or vice versa. Before the violence, Fimsangpui was the only Kuki living in her neighbourhood in Imphal. She said that when she heard reports that a Meitei mob had invaded Imphal University, demanding to see students’ ID papers to single out the Kukis, she knew she would never be able to live in the city again. She plans to remain in Churachandpur, Manipur’s second town, which has a predominantly Kuki population. “The physical separation that’s already there will now become complete segregation. That, I think, will form the basis for a separate hill state,” said Fimsangpui. “We can no longer trust the Manipur government. It does not want to protect us. And we do not want to forget the cries of those who died. We have to keep the memory of them alive.” (Some names have been changed to protect people’s identities)</body>

    <body>Last week’s balanced budget is an emphatic punctuation point for the first year of the Albanese Labor government. The issue is whether it’s an exclamation mark or a question mark. This government’s dogged pursuit of balance is not just in the top-line budget numbers, but in managing the global forces buffeting the economy while dealing with the immediate needs of the economically vulnerable and the intense pressures on mortgage holders. Related: Guardian Essential poll: Labor maintains large lead over Coalition despite budget failing to impress voters It has delivered a budget that sits within the tight lanes imposed by a post-pandemic global inflation challenge that turns the massive resources windfall flowing from the war in Ukraine into its own form of radioactive material. With what is left of the Coalition carping about the government’s profligacy and the Greens bemoaning its parsimony, the conclusion the government will be keen to seed is: if you are being attacked from both sides, then surely you have got the balance about right. According to this week’s Essential Report, this argument has merit, with voters responding to the government’s core message that it was prioritising support for the most vulnerable. Interactive Judging the budget against the last two Morrison-Frydenberg efforts and Labor’s own mini-budget last year, perceptions on benefit indicators have improved, although the low numbers of perceived winners across the board show a deterioration from the pandemic cash splashes. Buttressed by polling numbers that show Labor has extended its lead over the opposition in all key indicators (primary vote, two-party preferred plus and leadership), it’s hard not to portray this as – on balance – a solid first year in difficult circumstances. From the moment he assumed power, Albanese has had to confront a geo-political realignment amplified by the pandemic lockdowns, committing to a defence alliance with ailing colonial powers while seeking to renew economic engagement with an increasingly muscular China. Related: Albanese expresses personal dislike for gambling ads during sporting events as pressure builds for ban He has attempted to make good on his promise to get wages moving, particularly in the lower-end caring industries, where government is a primary funder, while recognising that meeting these obligations risks placing further pressure on interest rates. And he has had to deal with the compromises he made to secure power, not least the decision to leave tax concession to the wealthy untouched while waving through a flattening of the progressive tax base that will disproportionately favour the very rich. The once firebrand activist has been comfortable operating within these contradictions, wary of the consequences of venturing too far from the centre ground and, instead, committing himself to the long game of maintaining power. But there is a separate finding in this week’s poll that might serve as a caution to a government that has sought to make a virtue of moderation in its first 12 months in office. Interactive For all the careful calibration of messages about fiscal responsibility, people would have liked to see the government do more to relieve the pressures they are feeling now. While the partisan ties of Labor and Coalition voters might distort this judgment somewhat, it serves as a timely reminder to the government that fiscal virtue will not be its own reward. Further tempering any first-year triumphalism is a question looking at the past 12 months, where the majority of voters seem less than excited with how their lives have been under the new government. Interactive What’s striking in these numbers is that – for the majority on the majority of issues – people feel life is pretty much the same under the new Labor government as it was under the retrospectively execrable Morrison regime. There has been recognition of some action on the treatment of Indigenous Australians and addressing climate change, but in material – and emotional – terms there is a smouldering negativity underneath this sense of stasis. On one level, these are totally predictable findings for a nation that is experiencing an economic slowdown, in particular an end to the artificially low interest rates that characterised the pandemic years. Related: There’s nothing natural about Australia’s ‘cost-of-living crisis’. It’s time we had systemic change | Peter Lewis But it does provide a context for opposition leader Peter Dutton’s immigration dog whistle, calculated to tap this vein of brooding discontent based on the declining living standards that many Australians are feeling. The critical question for the PM will be whether balance and sobriety will be the best approach to responding to these cynical attacks that, as post-Covid immigration intensifies, have the potential to drown out the sober business of governing over the coming months. While the political orthodoxy is that successful governments secure the centre and hold it, there is an alternative view articulated in Anand Giridharadas’s excellent book The Persuaders. Giridharadas holds that the challenge for politics is not to seek the centre by diluting down policy and moderating messages to make them more acceptable to the uncommitted, disengaged voters who swing elections, but rather to bring the centre to you. Success lies not in convincing your progressive supporter base to moderate their ambitions in order to win the centre, but to activate them to build the consensus for real and lasting change. Giridharadas’s thesis is an argument for sharpening the political contest to enable the Albanese government to answer the questions that will define its first term – and its longer-term fortunes – by actually taking sides in difficult debates. Can this government build the political capital necessary to ditch the regressive stage-three tax cuts that will flatten our progressive system to disproportionately deliver windfalls to the most privileged and rob the budget of its ballast? Will it accelerate the shift to renewable energy that does not just compensate workers in carbon industries for the costs of transition but drives jobs and investment through a national electrification agenda or just do enough to try to keep everyone satisfied? Will it build on its modest housing fund to find a way of really addressing the perverse operation of a market that is delivering another layer of inter-generational inequity rather than fiddling around the edges? And will the PM’s determination to bring on the voice referendum prove the first steps in a nation-building through voice, republic and ultimately treaty and truth that is a catalyst for an Australian culture that is confident of its place in a fracturing world? Occupying the centre ground may be a legitimate launch pad for realising these ambitions, but the warning signs are already there that voters will expect more than just balance in the longer term. To truly change Australia, the Albanese government will need to be prepared to tip the scales. • Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company</body>

    <head>South Australia tells gas industry the state is ‘at your disposal’</head>
    <body>South Australia’s minister for energy and mining has told a conference of the oil and gas industry in Adelaide that his state government is “at your disposal”. Tom Koutsantonis made the extraordinary comments during his address to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association national conference on Monday morning. Related: Albanese government approves first new coalmine since taking power He said oil and gas companies were needed to achieve net zero by 2050, claiming “we cannot transform our economy to net zero without this industry”. “We are thankful you are here. We are happy to a be recipient of Appea’s largesse in the form of coming here more often,” Koutsantonis said. “The South Australian government is at your disposal, we are here to help and we are here to offer you a pathway to the future.” Koutsantonis made the comments following a speech by federal resources minister, Madeleine King, who spoke about helping to develop a carbon capture and storage industry in Australia through the government’s future gas strategy. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup King said it was important for Australia to remain a “reliable, essential” supplier of gas for domestic and export market as the world looked to reduce its emissions ahead of 2050. She said capture and storage was a “necessary part of a wider decarbonisation effort”, with the government having released new acreage for greenhouse gas storage projects for the “first time in years”. “The will is there, the knowhow is there,” said. “We want a regulatory system for carbon capture and storage that is robust and responsive and position Australians resources sector to bring new CCS projects on line.” King also said the industry could obtain credits for lowering their emissions below baseline under the safeguard mechanism, but only “if they are verified and scientifically sound”. The announcements were welcomed by the Woodside chief executive and chair of Appea, Meg O’Neill, who said it provided “a great opportunity to outline the ongoing role of gas in the energy transition”. “The strategy will guide a realistic pathway for Australia into the future whereby responsible resource development is understood and can continue,” she said. But O’Neill said “regulatory certainty” was required if the government wanted to develop a carbon capture and storage industry. “In Australia, I believe this is a technology that may have been judged too soon,” she said. “It works.” Related: Labor could and should have gone stronger on the petroleum resource rent tax | Rod Sims Extinction Rebellion South Australia spokesperson Anna Slynn said the comments from King and Koutsantonis were “dangerous” given the imminent threat posed by the catastrophic risk of global heating, and pledged to make attendees “feel unwelcome” through protest outside the venue. “The world’s climate scientists have been completely clear; there should be no further expansion of oil and gas if we want to avert complete climate catastrophe,” she said. “Life is in the balance. We will continue to make Appea feel unwelcome until they leave. The International Energy Agency has said limiting global heating to 1.5C as set out in the Paris agreement meant there could be no new oil, gas or coal investment beyond 2021. At another oil and gas conference last year, Koutsantonis was caught up in protests by Extinction Rebellion targeting fossil fuel producers over its role in driving climate change.</body>

    <head>UN labour rights watchdog facing backlash over Qatar conference nomination</head>
    <body>The UN’s labour rights watchdog, the International Labour Organization (ILO), is facing a backlash over the nomination of Qatar to chair its flagship annual conference despite a police investigation into alleged bribery of EU lawmakers by the Gulf state. The Guardian has learned that Qatar’s minister of labour, Ali bin Saeed bin Samikh Al Marri, is expected to take the presidency of the ILO’s international labour conference in Geneva in June, an annual event intended to advance global standards on workers’ rights. Marri’s name cropped up in the Belgian police investigation into the “Qatargate” scandal at the European parliament after it emerged he had met the chief suspect, Pier Antonio Panzeri, an Italian former MEP, at a five-star Brussels hotel before a meeting with lawmakers where it is alleged the minister faced planted softball questions from some representatives. Panzeri struck a plea bargain deal with prosecutors after being charged with money laundering, corruption and membership of a criminal organisation. Marri has never been charged or publicly accused of any wrongdoing. The International Trade Union Confederation, which claims to represent 200 million workers, has written to the UN body to express “strong concerns” about Qatar’s likely presidency of the conference, which runs from 5-16 June in Geneva. The ITUC warns of a “reputational risk” to the ILO, citing Qatar’s “insufficiently effective” labour reforms and “allegations that attempts have been made to influence decision makers in the European Union in a highly inappropriate manner”. The ITUC’s acting general secretary, Luc Triangle, told the Guardian: “With this letter we wanted to make clear to the ILO president that we are absolutely unhappy with this proposal because it undermines the credibility of the ILO.” The former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri struck a plea bargain deal with prosecutors. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images The decision to nominate Qatar for the conference presidency – which has to be formally confirmed by ILO member states, employers and union representatives at the start of the event – turns the spotlight on the Geneva-based body after criticism that it “whitewashed” the Gulf state’s labour reforms before the 2022 men’s football World Cup. One former ILO official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian the ILO had been “whitewashing Qatar” in the run-up to the World Cup and produced “biased” reporting on the Gulf state’s workforce reforms. The person said the ILO’s office in Doha was mostly funded by the Qatari government, and they raised questions about $25m the Gulf state had paid towards an ILO programme to increase worker protections in the country. Qatar’s $25m contribution was not publicised when the “technical assistance” programme was launched in 2017. “The ILO has been dependent on the [Qatar] reform programme on Qatari money, that’s for sure,” said the former ILO official. “It’s not the first time the ILO is doing programmes with governments, but it’s unusual that such a huge amount of money is put on the table.” On a two-day visit to Doha last December, the ILO’s director general, Gilbert Houngbo, praised Qatar’s “progress” in labour reforms, citing changes to the kafala sponsorship system, which was designed to give employers total control over foreign workers. Houngbo also cited improvements to health and safety at work, citing restrictions on daytime working hours during summer to combat heat stress. The UN agency’s positive reports were cited by the Greek MEP Eva Kaili during a European parliament debate last November when she declared that “Qatar is a frontrunner in labour rights”. About a month later, she was arrested on charges of corruption and money laundering in the cash-for-influence scandal. She has strongly denied all accusations of wrongdoing. But the glowing messages contrast with the findings of independent observers. Human Rights Watch has said the Qatari reforms were “woefully inadequate in protecting workers’ rights” and “poorly enforced”, while unions have said that since the World Cup, rogue employers in Qatar have been “emboldened by an absence of enforcement and growing confidence that rights violations will go unpunished”. When the ILO said last August that more than 242,000 workers had changed jobs since the introduction of kafala reforms, the NGO Fair Square said that figure was “implausibly high given what we know about employers easily circumventing the kafala law”. Fair Square has also described Qatar’s changes to summertime working hours as “demonstrably ineffective”. Nicholas McGeehan, a co-director at Fair Square, said: “To award Qatar presidency of the ILC at a time when its labour reforms are still the subject of such controversy, and the Qatari labour minister is a central figure in the Qatargate scandal would be an act of monumental folly from the ILO, and would lead to accusations that it has been captured by the Gulf state at a time when it urgently needs to demonstrate its independence and impartiality.” Sharan Burrow in 2017. Photograph: Paul Morigi/Getty Images But the ITUC, which is now leading the complaints, also faces criticism over its record on Qatar. A former ITUC general secretary, Sharan Burrow, told football fans last November to go to the World Cup and “have fun”, as she hailed Qatar’s “incredible progress”. She also said it was a “myth” that more than 6,000 workers had died on construction sites. An investigation by the Guardian in 2021 revealed that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup a decade before. Burrow’s replacement, Luca Visentini, was sacked in March after it emerged he had taken money from a Brussels NGO founded by Panzeri, the Italian former MEP seen as the linchpin of the corruption network. Visentini said he was innocent and all the money from Panzeri’s NGO had gone to the trade union movement. Triangle, who took up his post on 1 May, declined to comment on statements by his predecessors, other than to say Burrow had acted with good intentions. He said Qatar “still a long, very long road to go … where we can speak about free trade unions, where we can speak about workers’ rights, where workers can go somewhere to report a violation by an employer without being harassed afterwards or even worse.” Burrow has been contacted for comment. In a statement, the ILO said it took the issues raised in the ITUC’s letter extremely seriously. “While there has been undeniable progress on the labour reforms in Qatar, all parties recognise that there remains much to be done. The concerns highlighted in the ITUC letter, as well as other critical issues, are being raised with the government of Qatar by the ILO,” it said. The ILO also said the $25m contribution from Qatar had been used to fund a six-year programme and was publicised on its website. “It is not unusual for a government to fund an office within their own country, and this funding mechanism does not affect the independence of the ILO,” it added. In response to criticism of “biased” and misleading reporting on Qatar, the ILO said it had pointed to “the positive trajectory of labour reforms in Qatar” since the technical cooperation project began in 2017, but added that it had always and continued to “highlight specific gaps and challenges that remain in implementation and enforcement”. Qatar’s ministry for labour had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Qatar’s government has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the Belgian police investigation into cash for influence.</body>

    <head>Decision to lift interest rates influenced by higher-than-forecast rent increases, RBA says</head>
    <body>The Reserve Bank’s surprise decision to lift interest rates this month was “finely balanced” and aimed at diminishing the risks of high inflation becoming entrenched in the economy. Those risks include “strong population and low rental vacancy rates” pushing rental growth “even higher” than the RBA’s main forecast, the bank said in the minutes from its 2 May board meeting that hiked the cash rate another 25 basis points to 3.85%. The meeting weighed up two options: leaving interest rates unchanged for a second consecutive month or increasing them for an 11th time in 12 gatherings. Related: Banks cash in on RBA interest rate hikes as customers grapple with rising repayments The strong jobs market – with an unemployment rate remaining at near half-century lows of 3.5% and most new positions being full-time roles – was one factor tilting in favour of another rate hike. Weak productivity growth was another. “[T]he labour market remained tight and ... inflationary pressures were significant,” the bank minutes said. “That information point to upside risks to the outlook for inflation.” Given “the arguments were finely balanced” as to whether to hike interest rates or not, pundits will likely assume another rate rise in June is unlikely without some surprisingly strong economic data being released. An indication the RBA had been intent on at least one more rate rise after April’s pause was that members noted forecasts at the meeting “were predicated on a technical assumption” that the cash rate would increase from 3.6%. “Members also agreed that further increases in interest rates may still be required, but this would depend on how the economy and inflation evolve,” the minutes concluded. The RBA minutes preceded the federal budget released last week. Economists offered mixed assessments on the budget’s inflationary implications but investors viewed it as neutral. May’s rate rise stunned most economists and the markets, which had noted – as did the RBA board – that consumption in the economy had been weak, especially on a per capita basis. Many households were already “experiencing significant financial pressures”, the RBA said. The rolling shift of low fixed rates to higher ones as terms expired would also increase debt repayments. Related: The overhaul of the RBA would allow it to serve interests of corporations over the welfare of Australians | Nick McKim The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release wage price index for the March quarter on Wednesday and April jobs figures the following day. The RBA said wages growth was stabilising. “[A] range of indicators suggested that wages growth was running at an annual rate of around 3.5% to 4% in the March quarter,” it said, with the wage price index expected to peak later in 2023 “before easing slightly”. The budget predicted wage growth would exceed the inflation rate in 2024, bringing the first real increase in salaries for several years. Ahead of the release of RBA minutes for its May meeting (which resulted in a surprise rise) later today, investors were gauging risk of a June hike as a 3% chance. However, they view a rise in Aug or Sept as about a 40% chance, and have pushed back the 1st rate cut to next March. pic.twitter.com/ELf58iki2g — @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) May 15, 2023 Data from RateCity released on Monday indicated that a single person on an average wage who borrowed at their capacity two years ago to buy a home will be spending as much as 71% of their after-tax pay on their mortgage once the May rate rise kicks in. That amounts to leaving the person just $57 a day for all food, energy, health and other expenses. For a family of four who borrowed at capacity two years ago, with one parent working full time and the part-time, the post-tax, post-mortgage residual would be about $125 a day, RateCity said.</body>

    <head>Labor faces internal pressure to crack down on negative gearing with cap of one property</head>
    <body>Labor is facing internal pressure to introduce a new tax on the export of raw critical minerals and also to clamp down on negative gearing. Both measures are to be debated at the Labor party’s coming national conference, the first since Anthony Albanese led the party to victory at last year’s election. But the proposal to cap negative gearing at one investment property is likely to be viewed warily by members of the Labor caucus, given Bill Shorten’s proposal to phase out the tax concession for existing houses before the 2019 election loss. Related: Guardian Essential poll: Labor maintains large lead over Coalition despite budget failing to impress voters Albanese poured cold water on the negative gearing push on Tuesday, saying the government would stick with the housing policies that Labor took to the 2022 election, including the housing future fund that remains held up in the Senate. “We are a party that debates our policy live on national TV,” Albanese told reporters on Tuesday. “It [the national conference] will be held in Brisbane in August and people will put their views there but the cabinet determines the government policy.” One of the party’s most influential affiliates, the Australian Workers Union, is pushing for “a significant, punitive tax” on the export of raw critical minerals – like lithium, cobalt and rare earths – with the revenue to help subsidise domestic processing and manufacturing. The AWU’s draft resolution for the Labor national conference says Australia has some of the world’s largest supply of critical minerals, which are “indispensable for the high-tech products integral to the renewable energy transition”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The draft resolution calls for Labor to “impose a tax on unprocessed exports of critical minerals and establish a production subsidy scheme to foster domestic refining, processing and component manufacturing from critical minerals”. The AWU’s national secretary, Daniel Walton, will lay out his case in a speech to the Sydney Institute on Wednesday evening. He will say the AWU is “historically intertwined with the Australian Labor party” but they are “certainly not one and the same”. “When we believe a Labor government is at risk of taking the wrong path, we believe we have a responsibility to speak up,” he will say, according to prepared speech remarks circulated to media in advance. Related: Albanese expresses personal dislike for gambling ads during sporting events as pressure builds for ban “My fear is that our government sees its role as just setting basic terms for multinationals to dig these minerals up as fast as they please so they can ship them to wherever they want.” Walton will say such an approach was “lazy” and “misguided” during the mining boom that focused on iron ore and coal and gas – but “it will be catastrophic if we take that same approach with critical minerals”. “If we continue to just ‘let the market rule’ it will mean only one thing: Australia’s raw materials will be shipped off to China and China will be the only player in our region with the sovereign capacity to turn them into anything useful,” he will say. Walton will point to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act as a big signal that the US is “willing to use its unparalleled might to start driving manufacturing investment onshore”. “When the 800-pound gorilla in the global room switches tack like this, everyone else is compelled to recognise things have changed,” he will say. Walton will say while the US can use its raw economic heft and scale to force investment in manufacturing capacity through subsidies, Australia is not in the same position to “call the shots like this”. “But what we do have is a big chunk of the world’s critical minerals within our sovereign soil. That’s our leverage and we would be absolute fools not to use it.” The Nine newspapers reported that the separate calls for a crackdown on negative gearing were motivated, in part, by a desire to win back younger votes in the capital cities who were attracted to the Greens’ housing policies. The delegate advancing the proposal, Julijana Todorovic of the internal grouping Labor for Housing, told the Nine newspapers that the draft national platform chapter was “five lines of fluff”. She reportedly wants to cap negative gearing at one investment property. Related: Australia ‘diminished’: Penny Wong’s frenetic mission to repair regional ties Labor MP Josh Burns, who has advocated for housing as a human right, said it was “ridiculous” that the Coalition, Greens and One Nation were blocking Labor’s $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund bill. “We’ve got to pass that as a start,” he told Guardian Australia. “After that we can look at what we can do to ease housing supply issues.” Burns refused to be drawn on the negative gearing push but said the government needed “to be honest about our tax arrangements”, praising the release of the tax expenditure statement in February. It showed in 2019-20 taxpayers reported total rental losses of $10.2bn. Albanese said on Tuesday: “I saw the article and it says there will be a policy debate about issues at ALP national conference. Ho-hum. There’s policy debates about everything. That’s why we have an ALP national conference.” The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told the ABC’s Q+A program the government had not contemplated changes to negative gearing in last week’s budget because it had “found other ways to boost supply in the housing market”. “We increased commonwealth rent assistance, not because we think that that will make all the pressures in the rental market disappear, but because it will provide a bit of help for people,” Chalmers said. After losing the 2019 election promising a broader crackdown on tax concessions including negative gearing, capital gains tax concessions and excess franking credits for those not paying tax, Labor abandoned these policies ahead of the 2022 poll.</body>

    <head>Okonomiyaki: street food that helped rebuild Hiroshima in the G7 spotlight</head>
    <body>Leaked menus for G7 working dinners can be relied on to generate a flurry of stories about the summit host and its priorities – from the clotted cream fudge and seafood showcased in Cornwall in 2021 to the meat-light, sustainable fare on offer in 2022 in the Bavarian Alps. If this year’s host, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, follows suit, his G7 counterparts can expect a portion of okonomiyaki – the carb-heavy street food that helped rebuild Hiroshima after it was destroyed by a US atomic bomb. Restaurants in Hiroshima, where Kishida has his constituency, are using the opportunity to promote the city’s signature dish, typically made with batter, shredded cabbage, fried noodles and pork, the whole starchy edifice seasoned with a layer of sweet sauce, crisscrossed lines of mayonnaise and a sprinkle of dried aonori seaweed. An earlier version eaten in prewar Hiroshima – known as issen yōshoku, or “one-penny western food” – comprised a simple batter of flour and water cooked on an iron plate and embellished with chopped spring onion and bonito flakes.

Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian After the atomic bombing of 6 August 1945 left Hiroshima in ruins, malnourished survivors retrieved iron plates and turned again to the familiar snack, using huge quantities of flour provided by the US. As the city recovered, the simple pancake evolved into something far more satisfying, with the addition of pork, cabbage, eggs and yakisoba noodles. Hiroshima okonomiyaki – which roughly translates as “cooked as you like” – was born. Restaurants are expecting a surge in diners after G7 delegations, journalists and NGOs arrive in Hiroshima this week. The Oconomiyaki Academy has come up with multiple versions – reflecting the food culture of the G7 countries – which will appear on restaurant menus during the summit: maple syrup sauce for Canada, sausage and sauerkraut for Germany, fish and chips for Britain. “Okonomiyaki has gone from a food for survival to a speciality of Hiroshima,” the academy’s director, Shigeki Sasaki, told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. “Given current global events, we want to incorporate a message into the dishes that they symbolise the peace and reconstruction of Hiroshima.” The menu at Chinchikurin, one of about 900 okonomiyaki restaurants in Hiroshima, features vegetarian, vegan and halal varieties, and a touchscreen multilingual menu. “Okonomiyaki are round, which means you can trust them … there are no rough edges,” said the restaurant’s owner, Hiroaki Kawakami, after cooking the Guardian a regular version with an extra fried egg. “This is Hiroshima soul food. And I guarantee you’ll leave here absolutely full.”</body>

    <head>Hiroshima survivors urge G7 leaders to unite against atomic weapons</head>
    <body>A blow to the head probably saved Park Namjoo’s life. The 13-year-old schoolgirl, like many other children in wartime Hiroshima, was helping demolish buildings to make firebreaks in July 1945 when a piece of wood struck her on the head. Less than three weeks later, at 8:15am on 6 August, a recuperating Park told her parents she still didn’t feel like going to school. As she and her younger brother and sister traveled on a streetcar near their home, the Enola Gay, a US B-29 bomber, dropped a 15-kiloton nuclear bomb on the city. “There was a bright flash and a loud bang,” Park, 91, said. “It felt like a fireball was going through the entire streetcar. People were screaming and yelling at other passengers to jump out. I held my brother and sister’s hands tightly. It had suddenly turned dark outside … it felt very strange. No one had any idea what had just happened.” Almost eight decades later, as the spectre of nuclear weapons returns – this time in Ukraine – survivors of the atomic bombings, known as hibakusha, are urging G7 leaders to issue a strong statement against the use of atomic weapons when they meet in Hiroshima later this week. “Hiroshima was only able to transform itself into the city we have today because we have had more than 70 years of peace,” said Ryohei Tanabe, a Hiroshima survivor. “The G7 leaders need to understand that,” added Tanabe. An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people died instantly in the attack; by the end of the year, the death toll had risen to 140,000 as more succumbed to burns and illnesses caused by exposure to radiation. Park Namjoo, a survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima Photograph: Justin McCurry/The Guardian Had she been well enough to join her classmates Park, a zainichi ethnic Korean resident of Japan, would almost certainly have died. “Most of my friends died, which is why there are so few people of my age in Hiroshima,” she said. “If I hadn’t been off school that morning, I would have been with them.” Local officials hope that when G7 leaders see present-day Hiroshima’s green spaces and wide boulevards, they will reflect on the destruction that came before, now represented by the shell of the A-bomb dome. “Having the G7 summit here is of huge symbolic importance,” said Toshihiro Toya, deputy director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. “If the head of nuclear powers hear the voices of the survivors, then we hope that this will spur them to show more leadership on nuclear disarmament.” While Japanese officials have yet to announce an itinerary, G7 leaders will reportedly lay flowers at the cenotaph, which contains the name of every one of the 333,907 people whose deaths have been attributed to the A-bombing – the number rising every year – and meet survivors. “The people aboard the Enola Gay dropped the bomb from a great height, so they couldn’t see the people going about their lives below,” said Shintaro Fukuhara, who organises bicycle tours of A-bomb sites. “If they could have seen people’s faces, I wonder if they could have gone through with it.” ‘As if the sky was trying to crush us’ Vladimir Putin has kept all military options open in the war in Ukraine, and in March announced that Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus, bringing some of its arsenal closer to the rest of Europe. The potential for a nuclear exchange, almost eight decades after Hiroshima, is expected to push the issue near to the top of the G7 agenda amid pressure from anti-nuclear groups and the summit’s host, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, who represents a constituency in Hiroshima. While more than 60 countries have ratified a 2021 treaty to ban the possession and use of nuclear weapons, they do not include any of the recognised nuclear powers – including three G7 member states – or countries, including Japan, that fall under the US nuclear umbrella. “I hope the nuclear weapons states will understand the inhumanity of nuclear weapons, and take note of the spirit of Hiroshima and its desire for a world free of those weapons,” the city’s mayor, Kazumi Matsui, told the Guardian in an interview. “They should use the meeting to deepen their understanding of the realities of the atomic bombing and recognise that the only way to protect people’s lives and secure their prosperity is to abolish nuclear weapons. If they do that, I think the summit will have been a success.” Park, whose parents moved to Japan from South Gyeongsang province in South Korea during the war, did not speak publicly about the bombing for half a century, but decided to share her experiences after talking to a group of schoolchildren. The retired nurse never went back to school. Her father died of cancer more than a year after the attack, leaving the family with no income apart from cash they made selling sweet potatoes to Japanese soldiers returning from the front. She recalled how she and her younger siblings had walked the 100m from the burned-out streetcar to their home. As a mixture of rain and thick, black ash fell on the city, she witnessed people wandering the street, their arms outstretched to prevent melted folds of skin – “hanging like kimono sleeves” – from sticking to their clothes. “It was like hell on earth … it felt as if the sky was trying to crush us,” she said. “People complained about the heat and begged for water. As soon as they were given water, they died. All of the houses along the way had been flattened. I paused and stood on a river embankment, looked over the city and froze with fear. Hiroshima had disappeared.” Local government records show that about 118,000 people are registered as survivors of the Hiroshima bombing, with an average age of 84. “We are all getting old,” said Park, who has been treated for cancer of the breast, mouth and skin. “I still can’t sleep when I remember the bloated, blackened bodies. But above all I learned that humans are strong. I willed myself to live … if you decide you want to live, then you stand a chance.”</body>

    <head>Video shows Walgreens guard killing trans organizer Banko Brown as he left store</head>
    <body>Surveillance footage from a Walgreens in San Francisco shows the moment a private security guard killed a young transgender man accused of shoplifting. The footage captures the guard tackling and punching Banko Brown, 24, on 27 April before fatally shooting him as he exited the store. Related: A Walgreens guard killed a Black trans organizer. His community wants answers The video, as well as the announcement by the San Francisco district attorney’s office it will not seek charges against the guard, is likely to reignite protests, which have popped up in San Francisco and spread through California since the killing, with activists demanding criminal prosecution and calling for increased investments in Black trans youth. Brown was a budding community organizer known for helping Black transgender youth and had been struggling with homelessness in the weeks before his death. The footage, released by the San Francisco district attorney’s office on Monday and published by the San Francisco Chronicle, is taken from a distance inside the store and doesn’t have sound. Banko Brown poses with Julia Arroyo. Brown was a community organizer known for helping Black transgender youth. Photograph: Courtesy of Young Women’s Freedom Center It appears to show Brown walking to the exit of the downtown San Francisco Walgreens with a bag in his hand, and the guard, Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony, blocking him from leaving before pushing and shoving him. The guard then appears to punch at Brown’s head multiple times, before knocking him to the ground. The two appear to continue to tussle, with the guard at one point lifting Brown into the air before bringing him back to the ground and then lying on top of him as Brown’s legs flailed. Brown then gets up and starts walking backwards out of the store, appearing to say something to the guard. Just as he steps outside on to Market Street, a busy thoroughfare in downtown, the guard fires a single shot into Brown’s chest. Brown’s killing comes at a time of increasing violence against unhoused people in the US and an escalating crackdown on the rights of trans people. Brown was killed days before Jordan Neely, an unhoused street performer, was choked to death on a New York subway by a former marine, who is now facing manslaughter charges. Brooke Jenkins – the district attorney elected on a tough-on-crime platform and a promise to harshly punish shoplifting and other property crimes – has faced intense scrutiny over her handling of Brown’s killing. San Francisco police initially arrested Anthony, with the police chief saying: “You have to use force appropriately within the law.” But the district attorney released him days later, saying in a statement that security video “clearly” showed the guard had acted “in self-defense”. Jenkins had faced mounting pressure to release the video. Last week, San Francisco’s board of supervisors unanimously approved a resolution calling on her to make the footage public. Banko Brown was killed on 27 April outside of a Walgreens in San Francisco. Photograph: Sam Levin for The Guardian In her report on Monday, which was obtained by the Chronicle, the district attorney said there was “insufficient evidence to support the filing of criminal charges”. Prosecutors cited Anthony’s comments to investigators, alleging Brown was “aggressive” and intended to “fight” and saying “he was in fear that once he released Brown, Brown would ‘try to attack’ him, but this time with a weapon”. The officer claimed that Brown, who was unarmed, had threatened to “stab” him, but those remarks were not substantiated by witnesses, the Chronicle reported. He had no knife. A witness, according to the district attorney’s report, said that the guard said “dammit” after he fired the shot, and that after Brown was hit, Brown responded, “Sorry man, that shouldn’t have happened.” The district attorney alleged that Brown “transformed a simple theft into a robbery when he used physical force to take property without paying”. The attorney also claimed that it appeared Brown was “lunging” at the guard at the moment he was killed, justifying “a reasonable, though in hindsight mistaken, belief that Brown posed an imminent threat of great bodily injury or death”. The security guard in interviews repeatedly misgendered Brown, a trans man, referring to him as “she” and “her”. Police, the district attorney said, recovered “products belonging to Walgreens”, and the guard told investigators Brown had taken “some beverages and a few snacks”. His loved ones said he was probably sleep-deprived and hungry that day while struggling to find stable housing. “While I wish this tragedy would have never happened in the first place, it is my duty to follow the law and the evidence wherever it leads,” Jenkins said in a statement. “I join [Banko’s] friends, family, and community in grieving him and searching for ways to address the systemic issues that led us to where we are today.” Anthony could not be reached. Friends and family of Brown argued last week that Jenkins’ decision not to pursue charges “sets a dangerous precedent”. In a statement released through the Young Women’s Freedom Center, a local non-profit group where Brown was a volunteer organizer, they argued: “In a city like San Francisco, where so many have to make tough decisions to meet their basic needs, arming stores with the pass to use armed force will result in much more tragedy.” Julia Arroyo, co-executive director of the group, which has demanded an end to armed guards at retail stores and increased investments in housing and resources for trans and queer youth, said in a statement on Monday: “We do not need to see the video to know that Banko Brown’s killing was unjustified. Armed force is not a justified response to poverty. Young people, especially Black and trans youth who experience poverty, deserve love, care and the resources they need to survive and thrive. Banko deserved to live. He deserved to be protected and cherished. He deserved housing and to have his basic needs met.” “It’s beyond comprehension why charges wouldn’t be filed,” said John Hamasaki, who ran for district attorney on a progressive platform last year and is a former member of the San Francisco police commission. “We see cases filed all the time when there’s a fight and somebody pulls out a gun and shoots. You don’t get to execute somebody once the threat is over, and that appears to be what’s happening.” The footage, he said, seemed to show the guard quickly escalating the situation: “This is not what security guards are supposed to do. And it puts everyone in danger when they use excessive force at the beginning of an encounter.” Although San Francisco is considered an international LGBTQ+ destination, queer and trans youth in the city continue to struggle with homelessness, poverty and a lack of basic resources. There are more than 400 LGBTQ+ unhoused youth in the city, but only around 45 housing spots designated for this community, advocates said. Brown’s loved ones said he was unable to get a housing spot he’d long been pursuing, had been turned away from multiple shelters and recently had no choice but to sleep in public spaces.</body>

    <head>Rudy Giuliani sued by former associate alleging sexual assault and harassment</head>
    <body>A former associate of Rudy Giuliani sued the former New York mayor, presidential candidate and attorney to Donald Trump for $10m on Monday, alleging “abuses of power, wide-ranging sexual assault and harassment, wage theft and other misconduct” including “alcohol-drenched rants that included sexist, racist and antisemitic remarks”. Filed in New York state, Noelle Dunphy’s suit includes the allegation that Giuliani “often demanded oral sex while he took phone calls on speaker phone from high-profile friends and clients, including then-President Trump”. Giuliani is alleged to have told Dunphy “he enjoyed engaging in this conduct while on the telephone because it made him ‘feel like Bill Clinton’”. Clinton was impeached in 1998 for lying about an affair while he was president, with Monica Lewinsky, then a White House intern. The lawsuit also included an allegation that Giuliani asked Dunphy “if she knew anyone in need of a pardon” because “he was selling pardons for $2m, which he and President Trump would split”. The complaint added that he told Dunphy she could refer people seeking pardons to him as long as she avoided “the normal channels” of going through the office of the pardon attorney, a role within the Department of Justice, which could be subject to public disclosure. On Monday, in a statement to the New York Daily News, a Giuliani representative said the former mayor “vehemently and completely denies the allegations in the complaint and plans to thoroughly defend against these allegations. This is pure harassment and an attempt at extortion.” Giuliani was already in extensive legal jeopardy. His work in Ukraine seeking dirt on Trump’s rivals led to Trump’s first impeachment. His leading role in the attempt to overturn the 2020 election contributed to Trump being impeached an unprecedented second time. With his law licenses already suspended, Giuliani is reported to be at risk of criminal indictment. In her 70-page lawsuit, Dunphy says Giuliani hired her in January 2019. At that time, the suit says, Giuliani was “at the height of his influence, serving as the personal lawyer” for Trump, having “fashioned himself publicly as a major player in American politics, a successful businessman, and an important powerbroker”. The suit says Giuliani offered Dunphy $1m a year plus expenses to be his director of business development, also offering to represent her for free in a dispute with an abusive ex-partner. Giuliani is alleged to have deferred paying Dunphy, citing his acrimonious divorce from Judith Giuliani, his third wife. But he allegedly was swift to demand sex. “As Giuliani later admitted in a recorded statement,” the suit says, “he ‘wanted [Dunphy] from the day [he] interviewed [her]’.” The suit contains remarks it says were recorded. Giuliani, the filing says, “began abusing Ms Dunphy almost immediately after she started working”, making clear “that satisfying his sexual demands … virtually anytime, anywhere … was an absolute requirement”. The document is filled with lurid allegations. Giuliani, it says, often demanded that Dunphy “work naked, in a bikini, or in short shorts with an American flag on them that he bought for her. “When they were apart, they would often work remotely via videoconference, and … Giuliani almost always asked her to remove her clothes on camera. He often called from his bed, where he was visibly touching himself under a white sheet.” That allegation echoes a famous scene from a 2020 film, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, in which Giuliani appears to reach into his trousers and touch himself while on a bed, in the company of a young female actor he thinks is a reporter from Kazakhstan. Describing what Dunphy says happened the first time Giuliani initiated sexual contact, the suit includes a still from the Borat film. Dunphy alleges Giuliani coerced her into oral sex. The suit also says Dunphy had access to Giuliani’s private emails, including messages “from, to, or concerning President Trump, the Trump family (including … Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump) [and] Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner”. Dunphy also claims to have had access to communications with “presidential candidates for Ukraine [and] President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey”.</body>

    <head>FBI investigation into Trump-Russia collusion relied on shaky intelligence, says John Durham report – as it happened</head>
    <body>11.58pm BST Closing summary That’s all from us today. The day started off slow but ended with a few major events. Here’s what happened: Staffers in House Democrat Gerry Connolly’s office were attacked by a person wielding a baseball bat. This is a developing story, and we’ll let you know when more facts about the assault become public. John Durham released his long-awaited report on the findings of his investigation into an investigation. While he criticized the FBI for launching an inquiry into Trump’s connections to Russia during the 2016 election based on uncorroborated evidence, the report did not recommend any new charges. Representative Jim Jordan has invited Durham to testify at a 25 May hearing about the report. Rudy Giuliani has been sued by a former employee and client for sexual abuse, harassment and other misconduct. In the 70-page-lawsuit, Noelle Dunphy alleged Giuliani “abused his position as Ms Dunphy’s lawyer to pressure her into sex”. The lawsuit claims that many of his remarks were recorded. Some House Republicans are demanding that expanded border security and the construction of Donald Trump’s border wall be included in their demands to raise the debt ceiling. There’s no sign yet of the predicted surge in border crossings after the pandemic-era Title 42 expired last week, a top homeland security official said. The powers that be in Washington still have not reached an agreement on raising the debt ceiling, but Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy will sit down tomorrow as the 1 June deadline for a potential US government default grows ever nearer. Updated at 12.05am BST 11.44pm BST Rep. Jim Jordon has officially requested John Durham testify about the findings of his investigation at a hearing scheduled on 25 May, according to a letter Jordon tweeted out. pic.twitter.com/q0wrgdwVhN — Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) May 15, 2023 11.28pm BST In other news, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a bill banning Florida state universities from promoting, maintaining or supporting any programs that “advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion, or promote or engage in political or social activism”. According to CNN, the law also dictates that classes “may not distort significant historical events” with “theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States and were created to maintain social, political, and economic inequities”. DeSantis said DEI programs are a “distraction” and can be “better viewed as standing for discrimination, exclusion and indoctrination, and that has no place in our public institutions”. Updated at 11.32pm BST 11.10pm BST Senator Lindsey Graham said the Durham report was a “damning indictment of the FBI under James Comey”, and called on Senator Dick Durbin to hold a Senate judiciary committee hearing on its findings. “Sadly, this report – that shines a bright light on problems at the FBI and DOJ – reinforces the narrative that the rule of law in America is subservient to political outcomes,” Graham said in a statement. “It is a very dangerous development and moment in American history.” “Finally, my advice to those unfairly maligned by the bogus Crossfire Hurricane investigation would be to hire a good lawyer and sue the hell out of them,” the statement continues. Updated at 11.28pm BST 11.03pm BST The Durham report, which didn’t recommend any wholesale changes at the FBI except to suggest the creation of a position to oversee politically sensitive investigations, was recorded as costing about $6.5m as of last December, according to my colleague Hugo Lowell. More from his story here: “Much of the criticism of the FBI in the roughly 300-page report was already known when the justice department inspector general issued its own report, which raised similar concerns but ultimately concluded that the FBI investigation into Trump was justified. The Durham report was more scathing, finding that the FBI moved quickly on a vague tip about potential contacts between a Trump campaign aide and Russian officials in July 2016 based on “raw, unanalyzed and uncorroborated evidence” in a “departure from how it approached” the Clinton campaign. Also contained in the report: Durham said the FBI was more cautious of allegations of foreign influence when it came to the Clinton campaign, and did not pursue evidence in two cases of foreign governments trying to gain influence with Clinton while providing defensive briefings, unlike with the Trump campaign; Durham said the FBI was overly reliant on investigative tips from Trump’s political opponents and did not rigorously analyze the information it received, which extended the investigation and led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Trump; Durham said the FBI decided to move ahead with Crossfire Hurricane despite a lack of information from the intelligence community that corroborated the hypothesis on which it was predicated and FBI agents ignored information that exonerated key people in the case. The top FBI officials who oversaw the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and left the bureau years ago have long maintained that they had a duty to investigate allegations that Russia, a strategic US adversary, was seeking to garner influence with Trump, who had no experience in government.” Related: FBI accused of failures but key report finds no deep-state plot against Trump Updated at 11.04pm BST 10.40pm BST Trump has posted to Truth Social in response to the Durham report, according to CNN. “WOW! After extensive research, Special Counsel John Durham concludes the FBI never should have launched the Trump-Russia Probe!” Trump posted to Truth Social on Monday. “In other words, the American Public was scammed, just as it is being scammed right now by those who don’t want to see GREATNESS for AMERICA!” Updated at 10.45pm BST 10.24pm BST The White House has released the 2022 financial disclosures for President Biden. His finances have seen little change year-over-year, according to a Reuters report. More from Reuters: Book royalties for both the president and first lady Jill Biden, however, fell compared with a year earlier. Biden earned between $2,500 and $5,000 in book royalties in 2022 compared with $30,000 a year earlier. He also earned less than $3,000 in “speaking and writing engagements,” the disclosures show. 10.01pm BST Rudy Giuliani sued by former associate for alleged sexual abuse and harassment In a new and graphic lawsuit, Noelle Dunphy, a former employee of Rudy Giuliani, is alleging the former New York City mayor and lawyer for Donald Trump made sexual demands, was constantly drunk and “abused his position as Ms Dunphy’s lawyer to pressure her into sex”. The lawsuit claims that many of his remarks were recorded. Really lurid sexual harassament/assault allegaitons against Rudy Giuliani by is former employee Noelle Dunphy. She says she recorded many (and really, there are many) of the vulgar remarks. https://t.co/JCtsMAQLDm — Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) May 15, 2023 According to the lawsuit, “Giuliani began abusing Ms Dunphy almost immediately after she started working for the Defendants. He made clear that satisfying his sexual demands – which came virtually anytime, anywhere – was an absolute requirement of her employment and of his legal representation.” In one graphic example, the lawsuit details allegations of how Giuliani forced Dunphy to perform oral sex on him. “It became clear to Ms Dunphy that there was no way out of giving him oral sex,” the lawsuit reads. “She did so, against her will.” The lawsuit seeks at least $10m in damages from Giuliani and three of his companies. The full lawsuit can be found here. Updated at 10.07pm BST 9.56pm BST The FBI has released a statement in response to the Durham report saying, “FBI leadership already implemented dozens of corrective actions, which have now been in place for some time.” “Had those reforms been in place in 2016, the missteps identified in the report could have been prevented,” the statement reads. “This report reinforces the importance of ensuring the FBI continues to do its work with the rigor, objectivity, and professionalism the American people deserve and rightly expect.” Updated at 10.02pm BST 9.48pm BST For those just catching up, the Durham report is an investigation compiled over the course of three years by John Durham, a Trump-appointed special counsel brought on in 2020 to, as my colleague Martin Pengelly put it, investigate an investigation. From Pengelly’s report: His new mission was to look for political bias in the federal investigation which ensnared Trump and aides including Michael Flynn, the national security adviser fired for lying to the FBI about contacts with the Russian ambassador. Durham’s appointment came in the immediate aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump and Russia. Mueller did not find evidence of collusion but did lay out extensive evidence of Trump’s attempts to obstruct justice. Trump and his allies predicted Durham would reveal systemic wrongdoing, proving the rightwing conspiracy theory that a “deep state” of bureaucrats and intelligence operatives was thwarting Trump’s every move. Some Democrats cautiously welcomed the appointment. Critics said Durham was being sent on a retaliatory political mission. In October 2020, shortly before the presidential election, Barr made Durham a special counsel, thereby ensuring he could continue should Trump lose the White House to Joe Biden. On Monday, nearly two and a half years into Biden’s presidency, Durham released his report. It was highly critical of FBI and justice department practices but it did not reveal systemic wrongdoing or recommend new charges. As the Associated Press put it, the investigation had wrapped up after delivering “underwhelming results, prosecutors securing a guilty plea from a little-known FBI employee but losing the only two criminal cases they took to trial”. Updated at 9.57pm BST 9.23pm BST More Republicans are beginning to respond to the Durham report. Arizona Republican congressman Andy Biggs is calling for the defunding of the FBI, while Illinois representative Mary Miller called the investigation into Trump’s ties with Russia during the 2016 election a “partisan witch hunt”.

We are grateful for the members of law enforcement and medical professionals who swiftly acted to apprehend the suspect and care for the affected members of our Capitol Hill community,” Jeffries, who serves as House minority leader, said in a statement. “The safety of our Members and of our staff remains of paramount importance, particularly given the increased instances of political violence in our country. I have asked the House Sergeant at Arms and the U.S. Capitol Police to continue their focus on collaborating with our Members.

Will it be enough to break the logjam? You’ll have to wait until Tuesday to find that out. There’s been plenty of news thus far today: Staffers in House Democrat Gerry Connolly’s office were attacked by a person wielding a baseball bat. This is a developing story, and we’ll let you know when more facts about the assault become public. Some House Republicans are demanding that improved border security and the construction of Donald Trump’s border wall be included in their demands to raise the debt ceiling. There’s no sign yet of the predicted surge in border crossings after the pandemic-era Title 42 expired last week, a top homeland security official said. 6.54pm BST Democratic congressman says staff attacked by person with baseball bat in office Gerry Connolly, a House Democrat representing Virginia, said two staffers were attacked by a person wielding a baseball bat who broke into his district office in the city of Fairfax. In a tweet, he said: “This morning, an individual entered my district office armed with a baseball bat and asked for me before committing an act of violence against two members of my staff. “The individual is in police custody and both members of my team were transferred to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.” Here’s the congressman’s full statement: pic.twitter.com/PkVuYI4KHs — Rep. Gerry Connolly (@GerryConnolly) May 15, 2023 Updated at 7.10pm BST 6.41pm BST Biden announces Tuesday meeting with McCarthy amid debt limit deadlock Joe Biden said he would meet with Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday ahead of the 1 June deadline when the US government could default on its obligations if the debt limit is increased. While the president didn’t specify the subject of the talks, the two men met last week with other congressional leaders to find a way out of the logjam, though it’s unclear if the two sides are any closer to an agreement. Biden wants the debt ceiling increased without preconditions, arguing the US government should be able to borrow to pay for spending Congress already approved. McCarthy and the Republicans, meanwhile, want Democrats to support cutting spending and enacting conservative priorities in exchange for their votes. Updated at 6.42pm BST 6.29pm BST A pair of Republican lawmakers is circulating a letter that calls on Congress’s leadership to include measures intended to strengthen border security in the ongoing negotiations over the debt ceiling. House Republicans last week passed the Secure Our Border Act, a conservative measure that would limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum, bolster border security funding and force the construction to restart on Donald Trump’s border wall, which Joe Biden cancelled when he took office. Democrats controlling the Senate have shown no interest in considering the bill and Biden said he would veto it, so Kevin Hern, chair of the influential Republican Study Committee, and Ben Cline are circulating a letter calling on its measures to be included in the debt ceiling talks. “American taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for the rapidly growing illegal immigration crisis. Thus, we support the inclusion of common-sense border security and immigration reforms in negotiations to raise the debt ceiling,” the pair write in a text of the letter obtained by the Guardian. “Negotiators should also consider other common-sense policies, such as ensuring taxpayer funded welfare programs and tax credits are not available to illegal immigrants, restoring the Trump Administration’s public charge rule, and preventing relevant federal funding from flowing to sanctuary cities that harbor illegal aliens, among others.” A source familiar with the letter said it is being circulated among members of the Republican Study Committee, which is the largest ideological caucus in Congress. It is expected to be sent to congressional leadership and the White House on Wednesday. 6.08pm BST The early months of the GOP’s nomination process often bring candidates out of the woodwork, as (occasionally surprising) old names look for another shot at the White House. The Guardian’s Martin Pengelly reports that former Texas governor and energy secretary Rick Perry is considering a third run for president: The former Texas governor Rick Perry’s announcement on Sunday that he could mount a third run for the Republican presidential nomination encountered widespread mockery over a famous debate stage gaffe in which he forgot the name of a government department he said he would abolish. But Perry, 73, also ran into stormier waters, being accused of lying regarding his alleged involvement in Donald Trump’s election subversion. Perry is the longest-serving Texas governor, in office between 2000 and 2015. A telegenic ex-air force pilot, he ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016. Both campaigns flopped but, speaking to CNN on Sunday, he said a third run was “something that I haven’t taken off the table”. In response, many observers pointed to Perry’s debate stage nightmare in Rochester, Michigan, in November 2011. Perry said then: “It’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone. Commerce, education, and the uh ... what’s the third one, there? Let’s see … Commerce, education and the, uh, um uh … The third agency of government I would do away with, uh, education, commerce, and, let’s see … I can’t. The third one. I can’t. “Oops.” Related: Rick Perry hints at 2024 presidential bid and revives memories of debate gaffe 5.46pm BST Iowa’s Republican senator Joni Ernst had the following to say about Ron DeSantis’s visit to the state this weekend. She spoke to the conservative Newsmax channel: Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) says Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) was “very well received” while visiting Iowa this past weekend: “Iowa Republicans are fired up in this election.” pic.twitter.com/eJSZ1z7Rc5 — The Recount (@therecount) May 15, 2023 5.29pm BST We are nearing the time of year when Americans hear a lot more about Iowa than they usually do. The reason? Its role as an early voting state in the presidential primary process. And while polls shows Florida governor Ron DeSantis has a significant hill to climb to reach the same levels of popularity as Donald Trump, the Guardian’s Maya Yang reports his swing through the Hawkeye State this weekend appeared to be a success: Florida’s rightwing governor, Ron DeSantis, has rolled out a hefty list of endorsements from Iowa lawmakers as he visited the crucial early-voting state on Saturday in an attempt to garner support for his potential Republican presidential campaign. The pro-DeSantis Super Pac Never Back Down announced endorsements from 37 Republican Iowa state senators and representatives, including the Iowa senate president, Amy Sinclair, and the state house majority leader, Matt Windschitl. In an interview with the Des Moines Register, Sinclair praised DeSantis, saying that he stands “head and shoulders” above other Republican presidential candidates including Donald Trump and that the choice is “an easy endorsement for me”.

Here’s what he had to say, including his response to the oft-repeated demand from Republicans that he visit the frontier with Mexico: Reporter: How do you think things are going at the border, sir? Pres. Biden: Much better than you all expected ha ha. Reporter: Do you have any plans to visit the border? Biden: Not in the near term, no. No, it would just be disruptive, not anything else. pic.twitter.com/GXvv32APOu — The Recount (@therecount) May 15, 2023 4.53pm BST The Guardian’s Alexandra Villarreal has more on just how Joe Biden is trying to discourage migrants, and why advocacy groups say in this area, he’s not that different from Donald Trump: Last week, the Biden administration toughened its stance against migration at the US-Mexico border through a new federal regulation that severely restricts access to asylum. This “Circumvention of Lawful Pathways” rule effectively replaces the Title 42 public health order, which Donald Trump introduced ostensibly to stem Covid-19 but has functioned increasingly as an immigration enforcement tool, allowing border officials to quickly expel migrants without the chance to request asylum in the US. Title 42 ended on 11 May. The new regulation means people fleeing their home countries because of unlivable violence and instability are rendered ineligible for asylum unless they can meet one of a handful of exceptions. As a result, the US will probably return many more vulnerable people to dangerous situations. The rule is being challenged in federal court by advocacy groups. Related: The US asylum rule replacing Title 42 is strict – here’s what we know 4.38pm BST US border crossings dropped by 50% since Title 42 ended: DHS Unauthorized border crossings have fallen by about half since the United States ended pandemic-era restrictions known as Title 42 and replaced them last week with new, stringent rules, a top homeland security official said. “Over the last three days, we have seen approximately a 50% decrease in encounters compared to the days leading up to the end of Title 42,” the department’s assistant secretary for border and immigration policy Blas Nuñez-Neto told reporters. “It is important to note that while Title 42 has ended, the conditions that are causing hemispheric migration at unprecedented levels have not changed. We continue to see more displaced people in the hemisphere than we have in decades.” First imposed by Donald Trump as the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, Title 42 allowed the United States to turn away many asylum seekers. The rule expired at midnight last Friday, raising fears of a new surge in migrants across the southern border. Under Joe Biden, authorities announced new restrictions on migrants, including banning asylum seekers who passed through another country on their way to the United States but did not seek refuge there. “Since Friday, individuals who crossed the border unlawfully to enter the United States without using the lawful pathways that we have significantly expanded over the last two years now face tougher consequences at the border, including a minimum five-year bar on reentry and the potential to be criminally prosecuted if they try again,” Nuñez-Neto said. He noted that since Friday, US authorities returned hundreds of people including Venezuelans, Nicaraguans and Cubans to Mexico, and sent thousands of others from Peru, Colombia and Honduras to their home countries. 4.11pm BST One of the biggest legacies of Donald Trump’s presidency is the supreme court’s large conservative majority, which has already handed down decisions with major import to life in the United States. The Guardian’s Ed Pilkington reports on a new book that explores one of the tools that conservative justices have used to get their way: Conservative justices on the US supreme court consciously broke with decades-old congressional rules and norms to shift laws governing religious freedom sharply to the right through a series of shadowy unsigned and unexplained emergency orders, a new book reveals. Five of the six conservatives who now command the majority on the US’s most powerful court have rammed through some of their most contentious and extreme partisan decisions using the so-called “shadow docket” – unsigned orders issued frequently late at night, in literal and metaphorical darkness. The orders do not reveal who voted for them or why, often providing one-line explanations of the legal thinking behind them. The switch from openly argued cases, aired in public, to the unaccountability of the shadow docket was made purposefully during the pandemic in cases dealing with religious liberty, concludes Stephen Vladeck, an authority on the federal courts at the University of Texas law school. He warns that the trend is merging with the current ethics scandals surrounding the conservative justice Clarence Thomas to damage the legitimacy of the court and threaten a full-blown constitutional crisis. Related: US supreme court pursuing rightwing agenda via ‘shadow docket’, book says 3.49pm BST Besides negotiating over the debt ceiling, House Republicans have been preoccupied with a campaign of investigations targeting the Biden administration. But as the Guardian’s David Smith reports, the evidence they’ve turned up thus far doesn’t quite deliver on their promise: “This is a very serious investigation,” James Comer, chairman of the US House of Representatives’ oversight committee, told the rightwing channel Newsmax recently. “The allegations and the things that we’re investigating make Watergate look like jaywalking.” The Watergate scandal needed a whistleblower, John Dean, to bring down President Richard Nixon half a century ago. Republican Comer claims that he, too, has a “highly credible” whistleblower who will provide evidence that Joe Biden has been compromised by a foreign power. Such a monumental allegation from such a senior politician would once have been front page news. Even if Republicans were assumed to have partisan motivations, many observers would have begun with the premise that there is no smoke without fire. Related: A House Republican wants to prove Biden is compromised – but where’s the evidence? 3.30pm BST McCarthy says still &apos;far apart&apos; with Democrats on debt ceiling Despite encouraging signs from the White House over the weekend, the Republican speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, gave a gloomy assessment of talks on raising the debt ceiling when CNN caught up with him today: Speaker McCarthy offered a reality check this morning on debt limit talks, insisting they are still &quot;far apart,&quot; while the administration paints a rosier picture. pic.twitter.com/v3hLWjkdnz — Haley Talbot (@haleytalbotcnn) May 15, 2023 The US government earlier this year hit the legal limit on how much debt it can accrue, and around 1 June is expected to exhaust its cash on hand and potentially default on its obligations for the first time in history. McCarthy has demanded Democrats agree to spending cuts and other conservative priorities in exchange for the GOP voting to raise the limit. Joe Biden and Senate Democrats, meanwhile, say the limit must be raised without preconditions. The two sides met last week and continued talking, and over the weekend, Biden administration officials signaled some progress was being made. “I’m hopeful. I think the negotiations are very active. I’m told they have found some areas of agreement,” Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Saturday. Updated at 3.53pm BST 3.09pm BST While Donald Trump presses ahead with his new presidential campaign, Florida governor Ron DeSantis continues laying the groundwork for his, The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports, with a formal announcement of candidacy expected within weeks: Ron DeSantis is using the final weeks before he reportedly launches a presidential campaign to modify Florida law to allow him to run while serving as governor and reduce transparency over political spending and his travel. DeSantis is poised to sign a bill that would exempt him from Florida’s “resign-to-run” law, so that he won’t have to give up his office in order to run for president. Under existing state law, if he were to run, DeSantis would have had to submit a resignation letter before Florida’s qualifying deadline this year and step down by inauguration day in 2025. Last month, Republicans in the state legislature passed a measure that says the restriction does not apply to those running for president or vice-president. Related: ‘Impossible to hold him accountable’: DeSantis signs laws to ease 2024 run 2.53pm BST Speaking of last week’s CNN town hall, Axios has more details this morning of why Donald Trump acted the way he did at the much-critiqued event. As the first half of the town hall concluded, Trump was met backstage by adviser Jason Miller, Axios reported, who “as if psyching up a boxer in his corner or egging on a bully – showed Trump moments-old tweets from Democrats blasting CNN and saying Trump was winning.” He then came back out swinging, metaphorically. His tone grew more combative, and he at one point called moderator Kaitlan Collins a “nasty person”. “He was the leader of the free world again,” a confidant of the former president told Axios. The tweets Trump was shown included one from progressive House Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as another from his foes at The Lincoln Project. Updated at 3.02pm BST 2.31pm BST We’ve wrung most of the news out of the Messenger’s interview with Donald Trump, but the former president makes one policy announcement in the piece that’s worth mentioning. If returned to the White House next year, Trump pledged to release the rest of the US government’s classified files related to president John F Kennedy’s assassination. He had overseen the declassification of some of the documents during his time as president, as has Joe Biden. “I will tell you that I have released a lot. I will release the remaining portion very early in my term,” Trump told the Messenger. Updated at 2.38pm BST 2.09pm BST Trump fears rebuke if he dropped 2020 election lies, bashes DeSantis: interview In his interview with the Messenger, Donald Trump stuck to his guns when it came to his 2020 election lies and dislike of Florida governor Ron DeSantis. But in a sign of the former president’s reported unease over Roe v Wade’s end last year, he stayed evasive on just how far he would go in cracking down on abortion. “He has to do what he has to do,” Trump said when asked if he supported the ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy DeSantis signed into Florida law. “He signed six weeks, and many people within the pro-life movement feel that that was too harsh.” Pushed further by interviewer Marc Caputo on whether he thought the law was “too harsh”, Trump said, “I’m looking at many alternatives. But I was able to get us to the table by terminating Roe v. Wade. That’s the most important thing that’s ever happened for the pro-life movement.” Again, Caputo pressed, asking him to say definitively whether or not he’d sign such a bill into law. “I’m looking at all [options].” Trump said. That evasiveness is in line with how he reacted when questioned about the subject at the CNN town hall last week. Last year, the New York Times reported the former president worried Roe v Wade’s end could hurt Republicans, and indeed, the party performed worse than expected in the midterm elections held later in 2022. For all his waffling, the former president’s was much more definitive in how he feels about DeSantis, who has used his governorship of Florida over the past few years to position himself to succeed Trump as the GOP standard bearer. “He’s got no personality. And I don’t think he’s got a lot of political skill,” Trump said. Those who watched the CNN town hall last week will notice just how closely Trump stuck to his guns when it came to repeating his debunked theories that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Caputo unearths one potential reason why. The interviewer asks Trump is he doesn’t worry that the constant election fraud talk might pose a liability. “No. Because if you look at the polls, almost 80% in our party think the election was rigged,” he replies, adding that if he stopped talking about it, “I think if I didn’t I would actually be rebuked by a large portion of the Republican party.” Updated at 2.16pm BST 1.44pm BST Trump remains evasive on six-week abortion ban in new interview Good morning, US politics blog readers. Days after participating in a contentious and criticized town hall with CNN, Donald Trump continued what appears to be a mainstream media blitz by granting an interview to online startup The Messenger. Journalist Marc Caputo is not successful in getting the former president to clarify his stance on abortion, including the six-week ban now in place in Florida, but Trump does hold forth on potential primary foe Ron DeSantis, and shines some light on why he remains so adamant with his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Here’s a rundown of what we expect to happen today: Debt limit talks continue and comments from Joe Biden and his top officials over the weekend indicate progress may actually be being made ahead of the 1 June deadline for a potential US government default. There’s no White House press briefing today, and Biden is spending it flying from Delaware to Philadelphia and finally back to Washington DC. Kamala Harris is having a similarly quiet one, at least when it comes to interactions with the masses. She has no public events scheduled.</body>

    <head>Concerns over care sector amid UK rise in potential victims of modern slavery</head>
    <body>The number of potential victims of modern slavery in the UK more than doubled to record levels last year, with a particularly sharp increase in alleged exploitation in the care sector, figures show. Calls to the UK modern slavery helpline identified 6,516 potential victims last year, an increase of 116% from 2021, according to the figures from the anti-slavery charity Unseen. It said the potential victims included 173 children. In its annual assessment of calls to the helpline, Unseen said the most notable trend in labour exploitation occurred in the care sector, amid concerns about labour shortages and low pay in care homes. In the care sector, the number of potential victims increased from 106 in 2021 to 708 last year, the charity said. Exploitation of Indian, Zimbabwean and Nigerian nationals was particularly prominent in care homes, it said. Its report said: “For the first time, these nationalities have been indicated in situations of forced labour related to a range of care settings.” Of the 46 Zimbabweans who were identified as potential victims of slavery in the UK last year, all but one were working in the care sector. The report explained the context of exploitation concerns in the care sector. It said: “The care sector has always been an area where forced labour could be present because of the use of temporary labour and the levels of low pay.” Unseen said that in order to protect victims, it could not provide details of the cases. But in one anonymised example highlighted in the report, it said one case involved several young men and women working in care homes on student visas through an agency. At the time of the call to the helpline, they had been working 14-hour shifts for five days without pay. The agency was referred to HMRC for a failure to pay the minimum wage, and to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, the report said. The helpline also recorded 479 reports of sexual exploitation, an increase of 66% on the previous year. Instances of sexual exploitation made up 19% of all modern slavery cases. Eleven cases of alleged labour exploitation reported last year referenced the Homes for Ukraine scheme. These involved 31 potential Ukrainian victims, the report said. In one case, a Ukrainian had been offered £1,000 a month to cook, clean and shop, but received only £350, despite working for up to 15 hours a day and being subjected to verbal abuse. In another, a Ukrainian family were made to share accommodation with animals as their UK hosts controlled their travel paperwork. The report also mentioned one case of potential organ harvesting involving two potential victims. This month, a senior Nigerian politician was jailed for almost 10 years for his part in an organ harvesting plot, after the first conviction of its kind under the Modern Slavery Act. The Metropolitan police said they were investigating more cases of organ trafficking to the UK. Official statistics released this month showed that the number of potential victims of modern slavery was running at record levels from January to March this year. But there are concerns that the government’s illegal migration bill will make it harder to rescue modern slavery victims, because it proposes removing them from the UK before they can be conclusively identified as victims. Justine Carter, a director at Unseen, said: “To be serious about tackling modern slavery in the UK, we need much more awareness of the true size of the problem, better support for victims, and get many more resources going into targeting the criminals behind the exploitation. “Instead, the UK is bringing in new migration laws that criminalise some victims of modern slavery, forcing them underground and keeping them vulnerable to traffickers. We should be doing more to expose the extent of slavery, not driving it further into the shadows.”</body>

    <head>One in five workers will be higher-rate taxpayers by 2027 – IFS</head>
    <body>One in four teachers and one in eight nurses will be higher-rate taxpayers by 2027 as a result of the government’s record freeze on income tax allowances and thresholds, according to a leading thinktank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said better-paid public sector workers will be among the almost 8 million people – one in five of all taxpayers – who will pay income tax at 40% or above as result of the Treasury’s attempt to reduce the UK’s budget deficit. In what it described as the biggest tax-raising measure since the incoming Conservative government doubled VAT to 15% in 1979, the IFS said an additional 2.5 million people would no longer be basic rate taxpayers by the time the six-year freeze on allowances and thresholds came to an end in 2027-28. Related: Hunt and Braverman among five in cabinet earning thousands as landlords The IFS said the decision not to uprate allowances and thresholds was adding to the financial pressures on workers whose wages were failing to keep pace with inflation. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has said action is needed to repair the damage to the public finances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, but the IFS report is likely to lead to fresh calls from some Conservative MPs for taxes to be cut. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body that makes economic forecasts for the government, has said taxes as a share of national income are on course to be their highest in 70 years. Isaac Delestre, a research economist at IFS, said: “For income tax, the story of the last 30 years has been one of higher-rate tax going from being something reserved for only the very richest, to something that a much larger proportion of adults can expect to encounter.” The thinktank’s report said that in the early 1990s, no nurses and only 5%-6% of machinists, electricians and teachers paid higher-rate income tax. But by 2027-28, more than one in eight nurses, one in six machinists and fitters, one in five electricians and one in four teachers will be higher-rate taxpayers. The report said the failure of tax allowances and thresholds to keep pace with inflation – the process known as fiscal drag – had resulted in a “seismic shift” to the system and would be a big cause of the record fall in living standards this year. A third of the expected fall in household incomes was because of tax allowances and thresholds being frozen. The IFS said that in 1991-92, 3.5% of UK adults (1.6 million) paid the 40% higher rate of income tax. By 2022–23 that had risen to 11% (6.1 million), and the figure will reach 14% (7.8 million) by 2027–28. Of the 14%, 3.1% of adults (1.7 million) will face marginal tax rates of either 45% or 60% – almost as large a share as paid the 40% higher rate at the start of the 1990s. For the 40% rate to affect the same proportion of taxpayers as it did three decades ago, the higher-rate threshold – currently £50,270 – would need to be nearly £100,000. Delestre said there had been “a fundamental and profound change” to the income tax system. “The freeze to thresholds is supercharging that process, pulling an additional 2.5 million more people into paying rates of 40% or more by 2027–28. Whether or not the scope of these higher rates should be expanded is a political choice as much as an economic one, but achieving it with a freeze leaves the income tax system hostage to the vagaries of inflation – the higher inflation turns out to be, the bigger impact the freeze will have,” he said.</body>

    <head>China’s Hidden Century review – how opium and Christianity demolished a civilisation</head>
    <body>In 1860 British and French troops pillaged and destroyed the Summer Palace of China’s Qing emperors, carrying off pieces of art and chunks of architecture – and a tiny, hairy dog who belonged to the emperor. Looty, as the dog was renamed with impeccable bad taste, was given to Queen Victoria and was the first “Pekinese” in Britain. A portrait of Looty is one of the many arresting images and facts in what must be the strangest blockbuster the British Museum has ever staged. In 2007, this museum put on a show about China’s first emperor. China’s Hidden Century takes the story up to the last emperor – the child ruler Aisin-Gioro Puyi, deposed by a revolution in 1912. Yet in the closed world of the 19th-century imperial court, recreated here, it seemed nothing had changed for centuries. It’s a heady experience to enter the heavily ritualised ambience of the emperor’s inner circle. The clothes alone are incredible works of art: gowns and dresses intricately decorated with butterflies, filigree patterns, dragons. There’s a dress that belonged to the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively ruled China from 1861 to 1908 and changed her glittering apparel several times a day: nearby are costumes and wall hangings from the operas performed at court. It’s hard to tell opera from reality, so formalised was everyday life in this rarefied centre of power. A complete map of ‘all under heaven’, the extent of the Qing empire, circa 1800. Photograph: The British Library In 1911 the Chinese court sent two colossal vases, decorated with golden dragons in swirling blue, as coronation presents for George V. These 2-metre-tall cloisonné monstrosities are on loan from Buckingham Palace. Their size is an act of assertion: China’s empire still defined itself as “all under heaven”. But this exhibition shows in pitiless detail how far the court’s view of itself had strayed from reality. The Qing imperial army looked like they carried props from an 11th-century martial arts epic. The British had guns Britain plays a stunningly cynical part in the story of imperial China’s final decline and dissolution. A lithograph published in 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition that celebrated Victorian capitalist triumph, shows a cavernous depository stacked to the ceiling with goods for export: it’s proudly titled, “A busy stacking room in the opium factory at Patna, India.” The East India Company was producing opium in India specifically for export to China: its Patna brand was considered the best on the market. China’s senior administrator Lin Zexu, portrayed here philosophically drinking wine in the countryside, but fingering a sword, wrote to Queen Victoria in 1838 complaining about the British drug trade’s devastating impact on China’s addicted elite. Britain responded by sending the fleet. The first and second opium wars – it was in the second that the Summer Palace was looted, and Britain came to own Hong Kong – were the first direct, military face-offs between China’s time-hallowed civilisation and the industrial, upstart west. It was a foregone conclusion. Portraits, armour and weapons of “bannermen”, the elite of the Qing imperial army, resemble glorious props from a martial arts epic set in the 11th century. But this was the 19th century and the British had modern guns. Gunpowder was of course invented in China centuries before, as was movable type. How had world history turned so comprehensively upside down that China could now be humiliated and ransacked by Queen Victoria’s drug dealers? Waterproofs for a worker, 1800–60, southern China. Photograph: © Trustees of the British Museum 2023. One reason is glimpsed in a glass case containing a suit made of rice-fibre and palm with a bamboo hat, the garments of the rural and urban poor. The caption praises its efficacy as rainwear, but it conjures the ghosts of nameless millions who eked a desperate existence far from China’s bejewelled court. Meanwhile, technologies of the 19th-century global economy were starting to reach those millions. The new western invention, photography, was used to preserve the faces of ancestors: in an amazing example from the later 1800s, a photograph has been used to create an embroidered photorealist portrait of a man. But it was an older import, Christianity, that unleashed the most devastating cataclysm of 19th-century China. Christianity offered a rival worldview to Taoism and Buddhism. It inspired Hong Xiuquan, a village school teacher who failed his civil service exams, to declare that he was the brother of Jesus Christ and make himself Heavenly King: in 1851 he led his Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to war against the Qing. “Christ and I were begotten by the Father,” affirms Hong Xiuquan in his own correction of a British missionary’s letter on view here. A propaganda print shows the imperial army finally defeating the Taiping rebel capital, Nanjing, in 1864: their leader is depicted running away but in reality he was already dead. His remains were dug up and fired out of a cannon. Twenty million people died in the Taiping rebellion, making it the bloodiest civil war in world history. Still the court staggered on. If the emperor lived in a closed world, ordinary people were looking farther: a Chinese magazine here even illustrates the opening of Liverpool’s railway under the Mersey in 1886. This exhibition is atmospherically designed as a shadowy labyrinth, in which you discover one clue after another to an often shocking history. The curators try to end on an optimistic note. We meet the poet and revolutionary activist Qiu Jin, who was executed in 1907 and became a martyr for the new century. She’s projected on a cinematic scale as the face of the future. So, after the Qing dynasty fell in 1912, China lived happily ever after – you might walk out of this exhibition thinking if you have never seen a newspaper or history documentary. In reality there were horrors as great as the Taiping to come: the 20th century would bring Japan’s invasion of Manchuria, Mao’s Long March, the Cultural Revolution, and so on up to today’s powerful capitalist economy ruled by an authoritarian Communist party that’s making feints at democratic Taiwan. Where will it end? This dumbfounding exhibition shows modern history to be as thrilling and mysterious as the ancient past: but a lot more worrying. China’s Hidden Century is at the British Museum, London, from Thursday until 8 October</body>

    <head>UK sport needs independent welfare body, insists British Gymnastics chair</head>
    <body>The chair of British Gymnastics has called on the government to establish an independent welfare body to protect athletes across all sports – and to ensure governing bodies no longer face significant costs dealing with safeguarding cases. In a notable intervention, Mike Darcey said that while the benefits of playing sport were clear, the number of abuse allegations across multiple sports in recent years – including British Cycling, British Swimming, British Bobsleigh and British Athletics – showed the current system often left complainants unhappy and in limbo while they waited for justice. Related: We can no longer fail our children. Canada needs a nationwide sports inquiry | Kirsty Duncan “It’s time we bit the bullet,” Darcey told the Guardian. “It’s time for the government to accept that it is time for action. We need, as a nation, to show that we care as much about athlete welfare as we do about the medal table.” Darcey said he envisioned the new body as being like UK Anti-Doping – which would not only include investigators, safeguarding experts and adjudicators but also ensure that best safe sport practice was promoted across British sport. “Such a body would also have clear economies of scale,” he said. “Instead of asking 40 different Olympic sports to run their own systems we could have one centralised body as a centre of excellence. We would also take the conflict of interest out of the system, and everybody would rightly have much more confidence in the outcome.” Darcey said that even though British Gymnastics was now spending more than £1m a year on welfare and safeguarding in the wake of the Whyte Review – which found horrifying cases of bullying, abuse and discrimination – it was still struggling to deal with all the 1,326 concerns raised with its welfare and safe sport team since July 2020. “It’s hard because we have a very substantial backlog, and complaints are running at an elevated level because there’s much greater awareness and willingness to speak out, which is good,” he said. “But I look at how much progress we’re making, and I still think the athletes and everybody involved deserves better than I think we can possibly do.” Darcey said that as things stood there were at least three things wrong with the current approach. First, British Gymnastics was “ill‑equipped to handle these sorts of cases” as it did not have the expertise or resources to run a large-scale semi-judicial process. Second, complainants often had to wait too long for justice. And third, as British Gymnastics is an investigator, judge and jury, one side or the other often thought it must be biased. “Even if we had far more resources, I’m not sure we could ever escape from the fact that as a national governing body we sit in the middle, make the rules, and we’re investigator, judge and jury,” he said. “I think that’s a pretty invidious place for any NGB to find themselves.” British Gymnastics is not the only body to face mounting safeguarding costs. Last year British Athletics spent £600,000 on such cases and is fighting off bankruptcy. “Sports can get themselves into a tricky position where they either spend so much money on this that you put the financial wellbeing of the NGB in jeopardy, or you have to cut back on other areas,” Darcey said. “So it’s a series of unhappy choices, none of which are great.” This is not the first time such an independent body has been called for, with a widely praised report by Tanni Grey-Thompson in 2017 making a similar recommendation. However, as Darcey pointed out, little has happened since then. “But we want young athletes and parents to have confidence that the sports that they’re sending their kids off to participate in are safe places, and that if something goes wrong it will be dealt with appropriately,” he said. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport did not directly comment on Darcey’s calls. But in a statement it said it remained “committed to ensuring sport is as safe as possible for everyone, and will continue to work with the sector to strengthen the system where needed”.</body>

    <head>Plans for UK ‘genomics transformation’ aim to act on lessons of Covid</head>
    <body>Health officials in the UK have drawn up plans for a “genomics transformation” that aims to detect and deal with outbreaks of infectious diseases faster and more effectively in the light of the Covid pandemic. Information gleaned from the genetics of Covid proved crucial as the virus swept around the globe, revealing how the pathogen spread, evolved, and responded to a succession of vaccines and medicines developed to protect people. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) now aims to build on the lessons of the pandemic by embedding genomics into routine public health practice. The move intends to bolster surveillance for outbreaks, drive down cases of infections such as TB, measles, hepatitis C and HIV/Aids, and predict the course of future threats, such as avian flu and diseases borne by mosquitoes and ticks as they gain ground in a warming climate. “We changed our thinking about genomics during Covid,” said Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA. “It’s not that we need to generate huge numbers of genomes all the time, it’s that we can use the data to change what we’re doing. Genomics gives you information you can act on, it’s not just a research tool.” The boost for genomics is central to the UKHSA’s 10-year science strategy released on Tuesday. Among the plans, which cover infections, radiation protection, the health impact of the climate crisis, and vaccine development, is a commitment to the “100 Days Mission”, which aims to have diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines ready to deploy within 100 days of a new pandemic threat emerging. One way of detecting outbreaks early is to monitor the genomes of viruses and bacteria circulating in the population. Any sharp shift in the normal pattern of a pathogen can indicate that a particular strain is surging, perhaps because it has evolved to evade frontline drugs. The same approach can highlight when apparently sporadic infections belong to a cluster. Rather than waiting for a pattern of sick patients to emerge from GP or hospital records, genomic analyses of bugs, for example listeria and salmonella, can identify cases driven by the same source. Last year, UK health officials triggered a global recall of Kinder Surprise eggs after genomics revealed a cluster of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella infections linked to a chocolate factory in Belgium. “We’ll always need shoe-leather epidemiology, there’s no escape from that, but genomics can support it to make it fast, highly accurate and make us respond quicker and more definitively,” said Chand. Another strategy could turn hospital intensive care units into an early warning system for dangerous outbreaks. Instead of testing patients only for common infections, such as influenza, scientists could use genomics to identify all of the pathogens in a patient’s lung swab. While the data can be hard to interpret – many bugs will not be important – the approach can spot new and emerging infections that would otherwise be missed. A similar “pathogen agnostic” genomics strategy helped uncover how different viruses combined to fuel an increase in cases of life-threatening hepatitis in vulnerable children last year. Chand said that not knowing what the next infection would be presented a challenge. “In all likelihood, it’ll be a pathogen we didn’t expect, or possibly that we’ve never seen, and we need to have this kind of approach in play to support us.” According to the UKHSA strategy, humans have been hit by more than 330 new and emerging infectious diseases since the 1940s, nearly two-thirds of which appear to have spread from animals. The likelihood of more coming after Covid, Sars, Mers and mpox is increasing, the report adds, given the greater contact between humans and animals and the ease of spread as a result of global trade and travel. Here again, health officials hope to bring genomics to bear. The devastating outbreak of avian flu has killed tens of thousands of wild birds in the UK and the virus has been detected in mammals such as foxes. Through genomics, scientists can monitor how the virus evolves. “That’s a very active area for us,” said Chand. “We take international data every week and try and understand what we are seeing in the data and what the implications might be.”</body>

    <head>Grid connection delays for low-carbon projects ‘unacceptable’, says Ofgem</head>
    <body>The energy watchdog for Great Britain will label the decade-long wait to connect low-carbon projects to the electricity grid as “unacceptable”, amid tensions over a “blame game” for a mounting backlog of green power projects. Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, has written to energy bosses to warn that the current system, whereby energy projects queue for their connection, could be replaced by new methods to match power generation with demand. He will use his appearance at an energy conference to criticise a “legacy of stalled, unviable and often highly speculative ‘zombie’ projects blocking ready-to-go solar, wind and other renewable schemes stuck behind them”. Related: UK could unlock £70bn a year in renewable energy, report claims Renewable energy developers have accused the government of a “lack of vision” in planning the grid. They have expressed concerns that wait times of up to 15 years have made it difficult to attract investment as the UK competes with the $369bn (£295bn) US package of climate subsidies. Officials are attempting to rebalance Britain’s energy network away from fossil fuels in favour of renewables, with a target of decarbonising the UK power system by 2035. Separately on Tuesday, National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) published a plan to speed up connecting to the grid. It involves allowing developers to leave the queue without incurring a financial penalty, creating new contracts related to how quickly a project has progressed and allowing sites that store electricity to connect faster. The ESO said 70% of the pipeline of projects that have a connection date after 2026 would be able to connect between two and 10 years earlier because of the changes. Tensions have emerged in recent weeks over who is to blame for the delays. In an interview with the Observer, the National Grid chief executive, John Pettigrew, called for his company to be allowed to do “anticipatory investment”to help renewable projects’ connections, rather than wait for a grid connection agreement to be signed on a specific project. However, Brearley will counter this by telling the Utility Week Live conference in Birmingham that Ofgem has “removed all barriers to National Grid investing in grid expansion and upgrades ahead of applications” through its “invest and connect policy”. Ofgem announced a pilot of this model in December, accelerating £20bn investment in connecting up 26 offshore wind projects. It has launched a consultation to extend this approach to other energy technologies. However, the Ofgem chief will attempt to quell tensions over the situation. “Too often there is blame game between industry, generators, network operators and government. This needs to stop. We all need to take joint responsibility for getting the connections regime sorted once and for all,” he will say. Ofgem estimated that between 60% and 70% of high-voltage transmission schemes never connect to the grid. It found more than half of those projects in the queue had to wait five years or more to be offered a connection date. Brearley will say: “Polite queueing may be in the very best of British traditions – but the first come, first served connections regime is not fit for purpose if we are to end fossil fuel power within 12 years. It is unacceptable energy projects are blocking great low-carbon schemes from plugging into the transmission network – with connection times of a decade or more. “Poor connection speeds risk undermining us creating a net zero electricity system, protecting consumers from high and volatile gas prices and ultimately securing energy security and independence.” On Monday, National Grid set out its plan to hit the 2035 target, which included planning reforms, a shift away from the “first come, first served” connection system, and providing benefits to local people in return for hosting renewable projects. Pettigrew has urged the public not to block efforts to connect up low-carbon projects.</body>

    <head>Cush Jumbo to join David Tennant in Macbeth at London’s Donmar Warehouse</head>
    <body>Cush Jumbo is to play Lady Macbeth this winter in a production at London’s Donmar Warehouse that reunites her with David Tennant, her co-star in the Channel 4 TV series Deadwater Fell. Earlier this month it was announced that Tennant would take on the title role in Max Webster’s production of Macbeth, expected to be one of this year’s hottest tickets. Jumbo’s casting marks her return to the Covent Garden theatre where she played Mark Antony in an acclaimed all-female production of Julius Caesar in 2012, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. Jumbo said it had been “a joy to investigate Shakespeare” in such an intimate venue on that occasion and that Lady Macbeth is an irresistible part for actors: “She’s on everybody’s list.” Two years ago, in conversation with Anne-Marie Duff for the Guardian, she said that she would love to play the role. The timing has to be right, she reflected this week, adding that she is looking forward to exploring the role as a mother (she has a young son). Webster, who directed Kit Harington as Henry V at the Donmar last year, stages Shakespeare “in the now”, said Jumbo, “not somewhere in the past”. As such, one task will be “to make sense of the supernatural” in a modern setting. “We’re leaning into the psychology of that rather than: ‘Abracadabra, here are three witches!’” Her last Shakespearean role, as Hamlet at the Young Vic in 2021, was “life-changing” for Jumbo, who praised the support she had received from fellow cast members, particularly the younger actors, as it is “an enormous show to carry” as the lead. “You really can’t have much more of a workout than that – you come back with much stronger muscles for next time,” she said. Working together on the crime drama Deadwater Fell, before she played Shakespeare’s tragic prince, Jumbo and Tennant discussed Hamlet and Shakespeare in depth, she said. The Channel 4 series was their first project together although “we moved around each other in the Doctor Who universe” because she was in the BBC sci-fi show’s spin-off, Torchwood, in 2009. Tennant, who played the Doctor from 2005 to 2010, is “the kindest, most generous actor”, she added. Related: Cush Jumbo: ‘There was no makeup, no boys to kiss – all we had was the text and we rocked it’ Jumbo has just finished filming the thriller Criminal Record for Apple TV+ on which she served as executive producer and stars with another former Doctor, Peter Capaldi. Filmed in London, it is a police corruption story she describes as “really exciting, very dark”. The stage-fighting skills she honed on Hamlet proved useful for Jumbo’s role in another new thriller, Balestra, about an Olympic fencer. “I gave myself a stress fracture while I was training to fence,” she said. “It healed in the end but as usual I can’t do anything by halves.” Jumbo and Tennant’s Macbeth is among a wave of star-powered Shakespeare productions this year. Ralph Fiennes and Indira Varma will play the lead roles in Simon Godwin’s tour of the same play, opening in Liverpool, while Kenneth Branagh is taking on King Lear in the West End. Macbeth opens for previews at the Donmar on 8 December and runs until 10 February.</body>

    <head>Ministers told to set out plan for hiring mental health nurses in England</head>
    <body>UK ministers must set out how to recruit and retain thousands more mental health nurses to plug the profession’s biggest staff shortage, healthcare leaders are warning. Mental health nurses account for nearly a third of all nursing vacancies across England, resulting in overstretched services that are struggling to deliver timely care, according to research carried out by the NHS Confederation’s mental health network. Sean Duggan, the network’s chief executive, said: “Mental health leaders and their teams are pulling out all the stops in what are very constrained circumstances, but they cannot be expected to solve this staffing crisis alone. “The knock-on effect means that the mental health crisis the nation is facing will in turn become a crisis for the whole healthcare system and the country. This relentless pressure on mental health staff cannot be allowed to continue with the ultimate impact being on the patients who most need that care.” He urged the government to provide a “clear and firm commitment” that mental health nurses will be equally prioritised alongside general nursing in the forthcoming workforce plan. Duggan said this should challenge the “false stereotypes that exist about mental health nursing as a career and move the dial in terms of public perception as to what working in mental health in 21st century looks like”, which includes a wide range of roles in psychiatric units as well as working with patients in the community. NHS Confederation analysis carried out by the Nuffield Trust found that almost one in five mental health nursing posts were vacant. The report calls for strong direction from government and dedicated investment to reflect the fact that the 11% increase in mental health nurse numbers since 2015 is half that in adult and children’s nursing. The research also identified significant regional differences. For example, there are 63% more mental health nurses per capita in the north-east and Yorkshire (91 among 100,000 people) than in the east of England (56), after adjusting for need. The profession also faces a demographic timebomb. The data shows that more than half of mental health nurses are aged 45 and over, with one in five aged 55 and over, and a higher proportion of nurses in mental health services are approaching pensionable age compared with those in acute services. The status of “mental health officer”, which is held by many nurses who started working in the NHS before 1995, means they are eligible for retirement at the age of 55. The report warns there are significant cultural barriers to recruiting mental health nurses, with a “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest stigma” attached to these roles, in reference to the 1975 film that takes a critical look at the 1960s psychiatric system. There are also retention problems, with high dropout rates during training and early career, despite the fact that mental health nursing offers better progression opportunities, including a higher proportion of staff on the top pay bands. The Nuffield Trust estimates that about one in seven students who start a pre-registration course in mental health nursing will not graduate. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are expanding NHS mental health services and attracting, training and retaining the workforce – with the number of mental health nurses working in NHS trusts increasing by over 1,000 in the past year. We’re also investing £2.3bn of extra funding a year in expanding and transforming mental health services in England by March 2024, so an extra 2 million people can be treated.”</body>

    <head>Jürgen Klopp urges Liverpool to keep pressure on after qualifying for Europe</head>
    <body>Jürgen Klopp admitted to feeling relieved after Liverpool guaranteed a Europa League place next season courtesy of a 3-0 victory at Leicester but challenged his players to keep their rivals for a top-four spot “on their toes” as they continued their late push to qualify for the Champions League. Curtis Jones scored twice before Trent Alexander-Arnold capped a seventh straight victory with an excellent free-kick in front of the England manager, Gareth Southgate, to move within a point of both fourth-placed Manchester United and third-placed Newcastle, both of whom have a game in hand on Liverpool. A sixth-placed finish this season now is the worst-case scenario for Liverpool, who host Aston Villa on Saturday before a final-day trip to Southampton. Related: Curtis Jones double for Liverpool damages Leicester’s survival hopes Klopp conceded he seriously doubted Liverpool’s chances of playing in Europe as recently as six weeks ago. Liverpool were 10th after a 3-0 defeat at Wolves in February but they have lost two league games since, the last at Manchester City in April. Asked whether he was relieved to secure European football after a testing season, Klopp replied: “Massively. Six, seven weeks ago I didn’t believe it could happen. What we lacked at the time was obviously consistency. “There was only one way for us to do it, by pretty much winning all of our games. It is crazy but that was the situation we were in. We knew before the game that we would qualify for the Europa League if we won the game, which is absolutely great from where we have come from. “The rest is not in our hands but we know we have to win all the games until the end of the season to have a chance [of qualifying for the Champions League]. Our job is to keep the pressure on. It’s not likely, but if not then this is already better than we could have expected six, seven weeks ago.” Leicester travel to Newcastle next Monday before hosting West Ham on the final day but, significantly, their destiny is no longer in their control. Dean Smith, Leicester’s interim manager, insisted he can keep the club in the Premier League despite a sixth defeat in nine matches. “Yeah, of course I do,” Smith said. “I would be stupid if I sat here and said ‘No’.”</body>

    <head>Elon Musk subpoenaed over JPMorgan’s role in Jeffrey Epstein’s activities</head>
    <body>The US Virgin islands subpoenaed billionaire the cars-to-rockets entrepreneur Elon Musk on Monday to obtain documents in its litigation into the role played by JPMorgan Chase bank in the activity of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when he was a customer, according to a court filing. Related: Elon Musk wants Tesla hires cleared by him as he shifts focus away from Twitter The Virgin Islands government is suing the bank over sex trafficking by Epstein. The Virgin Islands has been trying to serve Musk with a subpoena, the filing noted, adding that Epstein “may have referred or attempted to refer” Musk to JPMorgan as a client. “The Government contacted Mr Musk’s counsel via email to ask if he would be authorized to accept service on Mr Musk’s behalf in this matter, but did not receive a response confirming or denying his authority,” the filing said. The government accuses the bank of “knowingly benefiting” from Epstein’s sex trafficking and other billionaires have been subpoenaed for information, too, Bloomberg reported. Epstein was ruled to have killed himself in a New York jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking-related offenses in 2019. According to the filing in US district court in Manhattan, the Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk on 28 April. The filing added that Musk, chief executive of electric car company Tesla and space exploration company SpaceX, owner of Twitter and one of the richest people in the world, may have been referred to JPMorgan by Epstein. It did not provide further explanation for its interest in obtaining documents from Musk. Musk, 51, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The US Virgin Islands authorities accuse JPMorgan of missing red flags about Epstein’s abuse of women on Little St James, a private island he owned in the Caribbean archipelago. The bank has said it should not be held liable for a former top executive’s relationship with Epstein. The subpoena sought all communications between the entrepreneur and JPMorgan regarding Epstein as well as communications between Musk and Epstein. The subpoena also sought all documents regarding fees that Musk paid to Epstein or to JPMorgan regarding Musk’s accounts or relationship with JPMorgan. It also asked Musk for all documents reflecting or regarding Epstein’s involvement in human trafficking and his procurement of girls or women for commercial sex. The details were part of a request by the Virgin Islands to serve the subpoena on Musk by alternative means because the government had not been able to serve an initial subpoena on Musk at Tesla or through an attorney who has accepted service on behalf of Musk in the past.</body>

    <head>‘No longer relevant to the UK’: list of 600 EU laws to be scrapped is published</head>
    <body>Ministers have published the list of 600 EU laws the government plans to scrap by the end of the year in a much-reduced Brussels “bonfire” that has enraged hardline Brexiters in the Conservative party. In a significant retreat on its retained EU law bill, the government has slashed the number of environmental laws that would have automatically expired on 31 December from 1,700 to 341. The list includes rules governing habitat regulations dating from 1996, covering saltmarshes and river fringes and orders relating to environmentally sensitive areas including places in the Broads, Pennine Dales, Somerset Levels and Moors, South Downs and West Penwith. In explanatory notes the government says these rules are no longer operational or “no longer relevant to the UK”. The former diplomat Lord Kerr, who was behind the article 50 rule that allowed Brexit, said he believed most of nearly 600 laws to be revoked by the government in its published list are “defunct”, but said he agreed with peers across the House that parliamentary scrutiny was important. It is currently at report stage in the House of Lords. A significant chunk of the repealed laws relates to fisheries, including sustainable fisheries partnership agreements with a wide range of countries from the Gambia to Seychelles. Other legislation relates to fish populations in the Black Sea and Mediterranean. There is also a wide range of laws being repealed that relate to “biocidal products” such as disinfectants, wood preservatives and insect repellants. Among the chemicals listed are acrolein, indoxacarb and creosote. Legislation that gave access to a valuable EU-wide criminal database, known as Ecris, has also formally been torn up. Ecris holds conviction information on third-country nationals and stateless people. However, by leaving the EU, the UK automatically lost access to Ecris, and the repeal will be seen as a formality. On Monday night, in a further government defeat, peers backed by 142 votes to 132 a provision to ensure ministerial powers to revoke, replace or update retained EU law do not undermine current environmental protections or food safety standards. The government has narrowly seen off a move to add procedural protections of workers’ rights by a majority of one. The bill has reopened old Brexit divisions with accusations of a sellout by Rishi Sunak from the likes of Bill Cash and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Rees-Mogg branded the decision to scale back the list of laws to go from 5,000 to 600 as “pathetically underambitious”. “Rishi Sunak made a specific promise to scrap thousands of EU laws,” the Tory MP for North East Somerset said at the National Conservatism conference on Monday. “He’s broken that promise. This is very unfortunate as one of his virtues is his trustworthiness and the surrender to the blob risks exposing the government to ridicule.” But legal experts and opponents said the bill was “reckless” and “irresponsible” in sweeping aside the “interpretive effect” of EU law, and through its granting of unprecedented powers to allow ministers to decide which laws should go without full parliamentary scrutiny. On Monday peers including more than a dozen Conservatives voted to amend the bill to include a requirement that any laws going through the shredder go before a joint committee in both Houses of Parliament with a debate and vote. Campaigners will be going through the new list line by line for loopholes with environmental and workers’ unions who have condemned the act. Other rules to be chopped, according to the government list, include: Membership of the Council of Europe convention on an integrated safety, security and service approach at football matches and other sports events. A “control programme” designed to ensure compliance with maximum residue levels of pesticides and to assess consumer exposure to pesticide residues in and on food of plant and animal origin. A directive related to measures credit and financial institutions must take to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risk in certain third countries. Regulation relating to sectors and subsectors that are deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage. Rules relating to a countryside stewardship scheme and flood risk regulations from 2009, which the government says in explanatory notes “have been superseded by UK legislation or is a duplicate of existing domestic legislation”. Tax agreements with the Channel Islands and Caribbean countries including the Virgin Islands and Aruba. Only 10% of the 714 transport laws that appeared on the government’s original dashboard are set for the chop, including temporary legislation on lorry drivers’ hours. The government will probably be questioned on its reasons for removing some asylum procedures which it says “are inoperable”.</body>

    <head>Tory MPs accuse Suella Braverman of making bid for party leadership</head>
    <body>Despairing Conservative MPs have accused Suella Braverman of undermining Rishi Sunak’s authority and making a bid for the future leadership of the party with a partisan speech railing against experts and elites. The home secretary delivered a highly personal blueprint for a political philosophy to take on the “radical left” in what was interpreted as a pitch to be the right’s next candidate, at a National Conservatism conference in London. Senior Tory MPs privately condemned her making an overture to become the party’s leader should the Conservatives lose the next election. One said: “Rishi needs to make it clear to her that she is either a team player or a backbencher.” In an attempt to reclaim the right wing of his party, Sunak will on Tuesday urge European leaders to crack down on immigration through tighter policing of its borders, after his surprise meeting with Ukraine’s president was overshadowed by Braverman’s rhetoric. Tory MPs have grown increasingly uneasy after a damning set of local election results and with ministers braced for a record increase in immigration figures next week, which threatens to undermine their pledge to cut arrivals. Sunak has also faced criticism from the pro-Brexit right of his party since it was announced that just 600 of the 4,000 EU laws he pledged to revoke by the end of the year would be scrapped. Conservative MPs were invited for drinks with the prime minister to mark the coronation in the Downing Street garden on Monday night. Sunak was expected to try to calm nerves there and draw a line under any potential mutiny. However, MPs suggested Sunak should warn Braverman to stick to her role as home secretary and get to grips with problems in the immigration system, rather than giving her permission to undermine his leadership. One minister said: “She’s not waiting for the election, but is pitching for prime minister now. And she’s not the only one. Being in the cabinet is no longer a collective endeavour but a position to pitch for the next job. It would be better if she and others focused on the jobs they actually had. You would think being home secretary was some side hustle.” Another MP described her speech as “outrageous”, saying: “It was rather rich that she was highlighting the problems with our immigration system when she’s been in charge of it for the past nine months. It was all about her ambitions, not about improving things.” A third MP said the majority of Tory colleagues were “rolling their eyes” at Braverman’s “unhelpful” appearance at the conference when she should be concentrating on tackling migration. “She’s doing it because she wants an audience … but it’s going to take a lot more than this one speech to make her party leader. It makes me despair. She should be concentrating on the immigration figures and our strategy for dealing with them,” they added. In her speech to the conference, organised by the rightwing populist US thinktank the Edmund Burke Foundation, Braverman commented on the need for the UK to cut back on legal migration and train domestic workers for jobs such as fruit picking. But she began with a description of her father’s arrival from Kenya in 1968, and her mother’s move from Mauritius to train as a nurse. She said her politics, like that of her parents, was “a politics of optimism, pride, national unity, aspiration and realism”. She said: “The left’s is a politics of pessimism, guilt, national division, resentment and utopianism. The left on the other hand sees the purpose of politics as to eradicate the existence of inequality, even if that comes at the expense of individual liberty and human flourishing.” Braverman argued that conservatism “has no truck with political correctness”, in a section of the speech that squarely addressed culture war issues. In one of a series of attacks on Keir Starmer, she said: “Given his definition of a woman, we can’t rule him out from running to be Labour’s first female prime minister.” She said the left was “ashamed of our history” and could “only sell its vision for the future by making people feel terrible about our past”, adding: “Nobody should be blamed for things that happened before they were born.” In apparent criticism of academics and other advisers in “ivory towers”, Braverman said Conservatives should be “sceptical of self-appointed gurus, experts and elites who think they know best what is in the public’s interest”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, told his MPs the Tories had responded to their election drubbing with “a series of mad hatter’s tea parties” which were “carnivals of conspiracy and blame”. The NatCon event came two days after Boris Johnson revivalists gathered in Bournemouth in another challenge to Sunak’s authority. The prime minister will on Tuesday meet other leaders at the Council of Europe in Iceland for talks about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but will use the opportunity to urge them to tighten the continent’s borders. “Every single point on each route used by people traffickers to smuggle people across our continent represents another community struggling to deal with the human cost of this barbaric enterprise,” he will say. “It is very clear that our current international system is not working, and our communities and the world’s most vulnerable people are paying the price. “We need to do more to cooperate across borders and across jurisdictions to end illegal migration and stop the boats. I am clear that as an active European nation with a proud history helping those in need, the UK will be at the heart of this.” The Home Office has reportedly been given data showing a further rise in migration, with the Telegraph reporting as many as 1.1 million foreign workers and students could arrive in 2024. Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift between Sunak and his home secretary, confirming it had approved the text of her speech and that Braverman was speaking on behalf of the government. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on overseas labour as part of building a high-wage and high-skilled economy and we are supporting those industries in doing that.” The 2019 Tory manifesto promised that “overall numbers will come down” on immigration. But next week’s figures are expected to show that more than 800,000 people arrived in the UK last year. Related: Tories preach baby-making and the facts of life – why does it always come back to sex with these oddballs? | John Crace The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, are understood to have successfully watered down an immigration crackdown on foreign students after arguing that it could damage the university sector as well as the economy more broadly. Braverman, however, is expected to announce that one-year master’s students will be banned from bringing family members with them to the UK as part of attempts to reduce net migration. One government source suggested that family visas had been “overused and a bit abused” by some universities to attract foreign master’s students, and that Hunt and Keegan were “happy with the landing zone” on the family ban. The number of family members of students arriving in the UK has risen more than tenfold in four years, from 12,806 in 2018 to 135,788 in the year to December.</body>

    <head>Trump-Russia: what we know about the Durham investigation of an investigation</head>
    <body>In May 2019, the then US attorney general in the Trump administration, William Barr, asked federal prosecutor John Durham, the US attorney in Connecticut, to investigate an investigation: the one carried out into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and links between Donald Trump and Moscow. Related: FBI accused of failures but key report finds no deep-state plot against Trump Durham had a background in investigating corruption on either side of the political aisle, and for attorneys general from both parties. His new mission was to look for political bias in the federal investigation which ensnared Trump and aides including Michael Flynn, the national security adviser fired for lying to the FBI about contacts with the Russian ambassador. Durham’s appointment came in the immediate aftermath of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump and Russia. Mueller did not find evidence of collusion but did lay out extensive evidence of Trump’s attempts to obstruct justice. Trump and his allies had predicted Durham would reveal systemic wrongdoing, proving the rightwing conspiracy theory that a “deep state” of bureaucrats and intelligence operatives was thwarting Trump’s every move. Some Democrats cautiously welcomed the appointment. Critics said Durham was being sent on a retaliatory political mission. In October 2020, shortly before the presidential election, Barr made Durham a special counsel, thereby ensuring he could continue should Trump lose the White House to Joe Biden, which was the outcome that November. On Monday, nearly two and a half years into Biden’s presidency, Durham released his report. It was highly critical of FBI and justice department practices but it did not reveal systemic wrongdoing or recommend new charges. As the Associated Press noted, the investigation had wrapped up after delivering “underwhelming results, prosecutors securing a guilty plea from a little-known FBI employee but losing the only two criminal cases they took to trial”. The little-known FBI employee was Kevin Clinesmith, a former bureau lawyer. In August 2020, he pleaded guilty to altering an email about Carter Page, a low-level Trump adviser with Russian connections who was subjected to federal surveillance but never charged. Charged with one count of making a false statement within both the jurisdiction of the executive branch and judicial branch of the US government, Clinesmith faced five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. In January 2021, he was sentenced to 12 months probation. He spent no time behind bars. In September 2021, Durham charged Michael Sussmann, a former campaign lawyer for Hillary Clinton, with lying to the FBI regarding an “alleged secret channel of communications between the Trump Organization and a Russian bank”. In May 2022, Sussmann was acquitted. In November 2021, Igor Danchenko, a thinktank analyst, was charged with five counts “of making false statements to the FBI … relating to the sources he used in providing information to” Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence operative who produced a famous “dossier” regarding Trump and Russia. In October 2022, Danchenko was acquitted on all counts.</body>

    <head>The Stones and Brian Jones review – broken hearts, fatherless kids and Nazi regalia</head>
    <body>‘Being a Catholic,” says Dawn Molloy, the mother of Brian Jones’s fifth child, “I was very inhibited. He kind of got that out of me – not to be ashamed of my body and what I could do. He was very, very sexy. Yeah. The way he made love was insatiable. He made me feel amazing. He made me feel loved and special. He was an amazing teacher of how to make love to a woman.” Nick Broomfield’s biography of the Rolling Stone whose drug- and booze-ravaged 27-year-old body was pulled from his swimming pool on 3 July 1969 is at its best when telling his life story through the women who loved him – and whom he, at least temporarily, loved. After his strait-laced parents kicked the longhaired, jazz-loving, seeming wastrel out of the family home in Cheltenham, Jones gathered no moss. He developed a modus operandi whereby he would seduce a woman, move in with her and her parents, charm the latter, get the former pregnant and then jog on, leaving broken hearts and fatherless children in his wake. Broomfield estimates Jones did this five times in the early 60s. Linda Lawrence, whom he met when she was 15 and he was 20, recalls the erotic high, but also the comedown. “We were the love generation,” she says. Years after he left her and their son, Julian, she turned up on his doorstep seeking a little money from the famous Rolling Stone to tide them over her. Inside, Jones and his new squeeze, the 60s It girl and actor Anita Pallenberg, were in the first throes of their affair. Instead of giving Linda money or even letting her into the house, Jones laughed at her, as did Anita. “When he started hanging with her [Anita], his dark side came out,” says Jones’s friend Prince Stash Klossowski de Rola, whose unlikely name, with its two apparent drug references, seems curiously fitting. “Anita was putting oil on the flames,” says the film director Volker Schlöndorff, who cast Pallenberg in his 1967 film A Degree of Murder and allowed Jones to write its incidental music. They were aroused by spiking others’ drinks and fighting with each other. “I guess they got a lot of sexual and or erotic excitement out of these fights,” says Schlöndorff. One photo from the time shows Brian and Anita in matching hairdos and gaunt beauty, he in a Nazi uniform with a swastika armband, like a prototypical Prince Harry. The image seems to sum up the sinister element of the swinging 60s: not so much its liberation as its self-regard, cruelty and dimwit politics. Jones got his comeuppance, at least. In Cannes for the film premiere, Pallenberg awoke in Jones’s hotel room, went down the corridor and was found later by Schlöndorff in Keith Richards’s bed. She got her most memorable role in the Stones’ rolling, incestuous swingers’ party. By that summer of 1967, Jones was already a falling star. True, it had been his love for, and appropriation of, African American blues music that made the Stones special; his retooling of Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and Howlin’ Wolf gave them the edgy sound that, say, the Beatles could never approximate. When the Stones played in the US, appearing on TV shows with Howlin’ Wolf, these scrawny, white London herberts were introducing many Americans to the blues for the first time. For that, at least, Jones deserves kudos. As Broomfield notes, though, the Stones’ manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, realised that Mick Jagger and Richards could make the group a hit factory – and that Jones, who did not write songs, was expendable. One of Jones’s lovers, the actor Zouzou, tells Broomfield that Jones hated the way the band was evolving away from the blues. “He said: ‘Mick and Keith are writing shit and I can’t stand it. It’s vulgar, awful and out of tune.’” Another of his lovers, Marianne Faithfull, understood Jones. His lack of self-esteem was worsened by Jagger and Richards’ self-confident creativity. He became increasingly uncertain of his own talents. He fell back on scotch and coke, downers and LSD, seeking succour in things that, as the drummer Charlie Watts says, he was neither physically nor mentally tough enough to handle. Apart from the odd flash of musical ingenuity – Bill Wyman reminds us that the flute on Ruby Tuesday was Jones’s idea – Jones became a liability, scarcely capable of playing live. When he was fired from the band a few weeks before his death, Jagger recalls, he seemed unsurprised. Forty years after Jones’s death, a heartbreaking note from his dad, Lewis, turned up in the attic of Lawrence’s family home. Read poignantly by Lawrence, it forms the denouement to Broomfield’s touching film. Lewis Jones regretted how he treated Brian: “I have been a very poor and intolerant father in many ways. You grew up in such a different way from that in which I expected you to. I was quite out of my depth.” And, in his short life, so was his son. • The Stones and Brian Jones was on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer • This article was amended on 16 May 2023. Brian Jones was aged 27 when he died, not 26 as a previous version said.</body>

    <head>FBI accused of failures but key report finds no deep-state plot against Trump</head>
    <body>Special counsel John Durham found no evidence that the US justice department and the FBI conspired in a deep-state plot to investigate Donald Trump’s ties to Russia in 2016, though the report released on Monday found that the FBI’s handling of key aspects of the case was deficient. The Durham report was sharply critical of how the FBI decided to open the counterintelligence investigation into Trump, known as “Crossfire Hurricane”, accusing top officials at the bureau of relying on raw and uncorroborated information to continue the inquiry. Related: Trump-Russia: what we know about the Durham investigation of an investigation Much of the criticism of the FBI in the roughly 300-page report was already known when the justice department inspector general issued its own report, which raised similar concerns but ultimately concluded that the FBI investigation into Trump was justified. The Durham report was more scathing, finding that the FBI moved quickly on a vague tip about potential contacts between a Trump campaign aide and Russian officials in July 2016 based on “raw, unanalyzed and uncorroborated evidence” in a “departure from how it approached” the Clinton campaign. But Durham’s inquiry failed to uncover any blockbuster revelations suggesting the bureau targeted Trump out of political motivations, and the report at times came across as a defense of his lengthy investigation. Also contained in the report: Durham said the FBI was more cautious of allegations of foreign influence when it came to the Clinton campaign, and did not pursue evidence in two cases of foreign governments trying to gain influence with Clinton while providing defensive briefings, unlike with the Trump campaign; Durham said the FBI was overly reliant on investigative tips from Trump’s political opponents and did not rigorously analyze the information it received, which extended the investigation and led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Trump; Durham said the FBI decided to move ahead with Crossfire Hurricane despite a lack of information from the intelligence community that corroborated the hypothesis on which it was predicated and FBI agents ignored information that exonerated key people in the case; Durham suggested that Crossfire Hurricane was “triggered” by the so-called Steele dossier, when it was in fact based on a tip from an Australian diplomat in London that a Trump campaign aide appeared to have advance knowledge about Russia releasing damaging information on Clinton. The top FBI officials who oversaw the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and left the bureau years ago have long maintained that they had a duty to investigate allegations that Russia, a strategic US adversary, was seeking to garner influence with Trump, who had no experience in government. The delivery of the report to the attorney general, Merrick Garland, and to the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate judiciary committees several hours before it was made public, largely marks the end of the nearly four-year investigation led by Durham. Durham’s appointment as special counsel by former attorney general William Barr was unusual in that he was essentially tasked with investigating a different special counsel – Mueller. The investigation was beset by controversy, including when Barr pressed Durham to draft an interim report just before the 2020 election, a directive that gave rise to allegations of improper political interference. In September 2020, according to the New York Times, one of the prosecutors on Durham’s team and former acting US attorney Nora Dannehy discovered that other members of the team had written a draft report that she had not been told about. Dannehy was reportedly furious and told Durham that no report should be issued before the investigation had been completed and especially not relying on disputed information that could affect the election. Dannehy sent her colleagues a memo about her concerns and resigned. While Trump once predicted that Durham would uncover the “crime of the century”, the investigation proved to be defective in court. Two people he charged were acquitted in court, and only the former FBI lawyer who altered an email to help prepare a wiretap application pleaded guilty. After the second acquittal – Igor Danchenko, a researcher who was a primary source for the 2016 dossier alleging Trump’s ties to Russia was found not guilty about lying to the FBI about where he got his information – Democrats called for Durham’s team to be shut down as a waste of taxpayer money. The Durham report ended without recommending any wholesale changes at the FBI, but suggested the creation of a position at the bureau to provide oversight of politically sensitive investigations with the power to challenge every step of investigations, including for wiretaps. Durham’s investigation was recorded as costing about $6.5m as of last December. Durham, a longtime federal prosecutor who was the US attorney in Connecticut during the Trump administration, was allowed to stay in his role by the current attorney general until the completion of his work. Two cases that Durham took to court ended in failure. Last year, a jury found cybersecurity lawyer Michael Sussman not guilty of lying to the FBI. A jury also found Danchenko not guilty of making false statements to the FBI in October, in a case argued personally by Durham. Durham extracted a guilty plea from Clinesmith, who was sentenced to one year of probation and 400 hours of community service after admitting in a 2020 plea agreement that he had altered a government email that a colleague then used to justify to a secret surveillance court the wiretap of the former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.</body>

    <head>Leicester City 0-3 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened</head>
    <body>10.21pm BST Time for me to sign off. It was a good tight contest for half an hour, and then Curtis Jones made a non-game of it. Thanks for your company and correspondence, and many congrats to Mary Waltz on getting the Liverpool win she was reduced to wanting. Our match report, from Ben Fisher, is here. Related: Curtis Jones double for Liverpool damages Leicester’s survival hopes Updated at 10.25pm BST 10.14pm BST It’s Jonny Evans’ turn to be interviewed. “I thought first 25 minutes till they scored, we were playing well… It knocks your confidence, to concede.” The first goal? “We probably got caught under the ball a bit.” Asked about the fans, he says “They were great with us tonight. They could see that we were running, working hard. I felt that from the crowd.” Updated at 10.15pm BST 10.11pm BST An email comes in from Luis, “from Liverpool but in Portugal”. “And both Uniteds play Chelsea,” he says. “Now Liverpool’s CL fate is in Frankie’s hands.” 10.07pm BST Curtis Jones is talking to Sky. One of his best performances? “Definitely.” The day before each game, he says, he has a shooting competition with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Fabinho. “The standard is very high.” Alexander-Arnold is by his side now. ”He’s got a level now that he needs to hit every game.” After playing like a boss, Trent is sounding like a manager. Updated at 10.17pm BST 10.02pm BST The ramifications for the top four Liverpool stay fifth but get another step closer to the Champions League places. Their sequence of seven wins has taken them up to 65 points from 36 games, one behind both Man United and Newcastle. Liverpool’s goal difference rises to 28, four behind Newcastle and no fewer than 18 up on Man U. But Liverpool have played 36 games to the others’ 35, so both Uniteds can see them off by winning two of their final three games. Newcastle’s next two fixtures are at home, where they are very strong – against Brighton and … Leicester. Updated at 10.03pm BST 9.57pm BST The ramifications at the bottom Leicester stay 19th, with 30 points from 36 games – one point behind Leeds (31), who are one point behind Everton (32), who are two behind Forest (34). They have all played 36 games, so Leicester and Leeds have 180 minutes to save their skins. 9.54pm BST FULL TIME! Leicester 0-3 Liverpool That’s it, with no respite for Leicester. They let in five goals last Monday and now it’s eight in eight days. Liverpool, who were far too good, complete their seventh win on the trot. Liverpool’s goalscorers Trent Alexander-Arnold (left) and Curtis Jones celebrate after the final whistle. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters As does Roberto Firmino. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters Updated at 10.03pm BST 9.53pm BST 90+2 min The player of the match is Curtis Jones. The cameras find him on the bench, roaring with laughter, as well he may. 9.51pm BST 90+1 min There will be three added minutes. There could be 30 and poor old Leicester still wouldn’t have a sniff. 9.50pm BST 89 min Smith sends on Harry Souttar for Jonny Evans, whose return went from happy to miserable in four minutes. 9.49pm BST 88 min Now Salah goes off, to be replaced by Harvey Elliott. In the Liverpool box, Vardy manages an overhead kick. “Re yr comment on the good night for Leeds Everton and Forest,” says Russell Richardson. “it’s a great night for West Ham, who cannot now be relegated (unless Leeds overturn an 11-goal difference in just 2 games).” Good spot! I was rather assuming they were safe already. Liverpool are making all sorts of people happy tonight. You never work alone. 9.45pm BST 86 min Leicester’s remaining supporters come to life as Konate is booked for a foul on Maddison. The free kick, taken by Maddison himself, curls harmlessly through to Allison. Updated at 9.46pm BST 9.44pm BST 83 min The latest player to leave the fray is Curtis Jones. His only rival for man of the match is going to be Mo Salah, who has his first PL hat-trick of assists. Jones’s place is taken by Fabio Carvalho. 9.41pm BST 81 min Liverpool are knocking it around now, allowing me to catch up with some correspondence. “Think this is a good time,” says Espen Bommen, “to point out that no matter how many goals Curtis Jones scores today, or in his career, nothing will ever come close to the one he scored when we knocked Everton out of the FA Cup with our U-12s.” Ha. 9.38pm BST 78 min Leicester get into the Liverpool box but, as usual, nothing comes of it. Liverpool cruise up the other end, Salah is clean through – and he misses! Liverpool&apos;s Mohamed Salah rues his miss. Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 9.49pm BST 9.36pm BST 76 min And Mo Salah hasn’t got a goal yet. He sniffs one now, but Faes produces a textbook tackle. Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah is denied by a fine tackle by Leicester City&apos;s Wout Faes. Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty Images Updated at 9.56pm BST 9.35pm BST 75 min As some Leicester fans trickle out, Klopp makes some substitutions. On come James Milner, for Henderson, and Diogo Jota, for Diaz. Luke Thomas is on for Leicester too, in place of Pereira. It’s time for an early exit for some Foxes fans. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters Updated at 9.50pm BST 9.33pm BST 73 min So Liverpool are heading for 65 points, one behind Newcastle and Man United, who both have a game in hand. At the other end, this is looking like a good night for Leeds, Everton and Forest. 9.31pm BST 71 min It was one of those rolled free kicks. Alexander-Arnold ran on to it as if he already knew it was going in the far corner. At this point Daniel Iversen might prefer it if I got his name wrong. Trent Alexander-Arnold fires home Liverpool’s third. Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty Images Alexander-Arnold (centre) and Fabinho (right) celebrate. Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images Whilst Jamie Vardy (left) and Jonny Evans look dejected after going further behind. Photograph: James Williamson/AMA/Getty Images Updated at 9.47pm BST 9.30pm BST GOAL! Leicester 0-3 Liverpool (Alexander-Arnold 70) A screamer! And a nail in Leicester’s coffin. 9.29pm BST 68 min Henderson wins a free kick just outside the area, off Evans, who is most indignant. “Danny Ward’s not playing tonight,” says Bert Fill. “n fact he’s not even on the bench! Daniel Iversen’s the (un)lucky man picked to play in Leicester’s goal.” Ah sorry. As the dad of a Dan myself, I should have done better. 9.26pm BST 66 min A chant is ringing round the ground and it seems to be all about Roberto Firmino, who is in the stand with Darwin Nunez. It brings a smile to Firmino’s face, not that that takes much doing. Liverpool fans are enjoying themselves in the stands. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters Updated at 9.31pm BST 9.24pm BST 64 min Leicester manage a moment of possession, but Maddison, just when he’s looking foxy near the box, foxes himself and gives the ball away. 9.22pm BST 62 min The cameras find Gareth Southgate and his Scotland counterpart, Steve Clarke, who may be wondering if Curtis Jones has a Scottish granny. 9.20pm BST 61 min Yes, it’s Daka and Tete coming on. Smith sacrifices Barnes and Ndidi. 9.19pm BST 60 min Alexander-Arnold plays a gorgeous long ball, first time, on the half-turn, to Salah, but his lay-off to Henderson just brings a less successful crossfield pass. Updated at 9.19pm BST 9.18pm BST 58 min Dean Smith is lining up some subs – Daka and maybe Tete. 9.16pm BST 57 min Diaz goes in high on Maddison and could well join Pereira in the book, but Craig Pawson doesn’t see it that way. 9.14pm BST 55 min Another glimmer for Vardy, swiftly extinguished by Konate. Liverpool’s Ibrahima Konate puts a stopy to Jamie Vardy’s advance as darkness envelopes the King Power. Photograph: Tim Goode/PA Updated at 9.24pm BST 9.14pm BST 54 min Liverpool turn the corner into a counter and Pereira takes a yellow for the team. Salah has a chance but balloons it. Leicester’s fans dig deep and muster a bit of scorn. 9.11pm BST 52 min Leicester have a shot! Harvey Barnes curls a good one from the D, palmed round the post by Alisson. 9.09pm BST 48 min Slight technical hitch here – sorry. Alexander-Arnold floats a long ball forward and Danny Ward nearly gets into trouble, coming for the header and missing. Updated at 9.09pm BST 8.57pm BST The man of the moment. Curtis Jones’ first half by numbers vs. Leicester: 88% pass accuracy 47 touches 36 passes completed 2/2 ground duels won 2 goals 1/1 tackles won 1/1 dribbles completed 1/1 long balls completed 1 key pass Scored an exceptional second goal. 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/nIifXwUGGS — Statman Dave (@StatmanDave) May 15, 2023 8.56pm BST “If Gakpo leaves that chance,” says Tom Barneby, “Jones was right behind him and would have had a shout at quickest hat-trick ever.” 8.56pm BST “Tim, greetings from California.” Mary Waltz, we’ve been expecting you. “A diehard Everton fan rooting for Liverpool. That is the pathetic state we have been reduced to.” Ha. “Even though I am a closeted fan of Klopp it is still hard to root for the Red. Most of my California Premier League friends are fans of the traditional top 6 squads and I am constantly eating crow as a bottom feeding Everton fan. Nevertheless, go Liverpool, do your best and help save us from relegation.” 8.53pm BST HALF-TIME! Leicester 0-2 Liverpool What began as a mini-game of two halves turned into a tale of two goals, both scored by Curtis Jones. He scores with his left, he scores with his right. He had only amassed four PL goals before this, but apparently it’s not his first brace – he managed one at Lincoln in the League Cup. Lethal in the East Midlands. Jones’s efforts have left Leicester on the brink. They actually started well, with James Maddison showing his class and creativity. But now they need a miracle, and Dean Smith has not been a miracle-worker so far. 8.49pm BST 45+2 min We’re having four added minutes. Leicester get the ball over the halfway line, twice, but only by lofting it, so Liverpool take possession again. It’s not been pleasant viewing for the Leicester City fans. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters Updated at 9.07pm BST 8.46pm BST 45 min The free kick is cleared but Liverpool come again with Henderson powering down the right. His movement is about 10pc pace, 90pc determination. Leicester see off the danger but they look defeated. Vardy, who started strongly, has had four touches. Updated at 8.47pm BST 8.44pm BST 44 min Leicester can’t get hold of the ball. Now Gakpo wins a free kick as Soumare commits a silly foul 25 yards out. 8.43pm BST 41 min Robertson pops up in the box, spins and shoots wide but he’s offside. That save a couple of minutes ago, by the way, was from Gakpo. 8.40pm BST 40 min A third of Curtis Jones’s goals in his PL career have come tonight. Updated at 8.42pm BST 8.39pm BST 39 min Leicester threaten to concede a third! Mayhem in their box and a good save from (I think) Salah. 8.38pm BST This one stands too! The Wout Faes of this match is Curtis Jones. 8.37pm BST GOAL! Leicester 0-2 Liverpool (Jones 36) Jones keeping up with himself! With a more spectacular finish from the edge of the box. But again the crosshairs are coming out… Curtis Jones lets fly … Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters The ball flies past Leicester City keeper Daniel Iversen and Jones has doubled Liverpool’s lead. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters Jones celebrates scoring for the second time of the night. Photograph: Tim Goode/PA Updated at 9.41pm BST 8.35pm BST 35 min The move had begun with Alisson going long to Diaz, the player who may have been an inch offside. 8.35pm BST The goal stands! Ahhh, that was tight. So maybe fair enough – nothing clear and obvious. 8.34pm BST Hang on, the crosshairs are coming out… 8.33pm BST GOAL! Leicester 0-1 Liverpool (Jones 33) It’s been coming! A neat finish from a chipped cross by Salah. Curtis Jones fires home to give the visitors the lead. Photograph: Ryan Browne/Shutterstock Here’s a view of Jones’ finish from behind the goal. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images Jones (centre) celebrates with Jordan Henderson (left) and Luis Diaz. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters Wout Faes and his Leicester City teammates look dejected after going behind. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters Updated at 9.11pm BST 8.31pm BST 31 min Curtis Jones puts in a surging run, then falls over and squeezes the ball to Fabinho, who blasts it into Row Z. 8.30pm BST 29 min Diaz is slipped through by a clever chip from Robertson. He has a shot at the near post, which is (a) wide and (b) the wrong choice. Klopp says this with his body language, making big eyes with his hands. 8.28pm BST 26 min Evans almost plays himself into trouble in the six-yard box, then does well to wiggle his way out. Defending – it’s like riding a bike. Harvey Barnes dribbles towards the centre circle but then gets caught in a red-shirted sandwich and needs some treatment. 8.25pm BST 25 min Leicester are suddenly playing like a team who are in the relegation zone, forming a low block, shrinking back into a 4-5-1. In an effort to launch them up field, Danny Ward goes long, but soon Alexander-Arnold and Henderson are pulling the strings again. 8.22pm BST 22 min Over the past ten minutes, Liverpool have had three-quarters of the possession. It’s been a miniature game of two halves. The Leicester fans urge on their team. Photograph: Daniel Chesterton/Offside/Getty Images Updated at 8.32pm BST 8.20pm BST 19 min Another Liverpool corner comes to nothing. The commentator points out that it’s two years today since the second-finest hour in Leicester’s recent history, their FA Cup win over Chelsea. “Klopp is whining as much as Arteta,” says Jeff Sax. “A bad sign for Liverpool.” 8.17pm BST 16 min Press and counter-press and then Liverpool are away, with Henderson and Salah playing a smart diagonal one-two. Alexander-Arnold puts in a dink, wins a corner and takes it himself, but it all peters out with a Leicester free kick. Updated at 8.17pm BST 8.15pm BST 14 min Liverpool come top the party with a spell of possession. It culminates in a cross from the right that Luis Diaz gets a touch to, but not a shot of any power. 8.13pm BST 12 min Another through ball, gorgeously struck by Maddison, sends Barnes away. He slips it to Vardy, whose shot is smothered by the onrushing Alisson. Leicester&apos;s Jamie Vardy (left) is denied by Liverpool&apos;s goalkeeper Alisson. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA Updated at 8.29pm BST 8.11pm BST 10 min Leicester still going for it: Alisson has to sweep up twice as the through balls keep coming. So far, the real Leicester are standing up. 8.09pm BST 7 min Up pops one of those panels saying Action Areas: 18pc in Liverpool’s attacking third, 43pc in Liverpool’s. Leicester are winning most of the second balls. Liverpool&apos;s Trent Alexander-Arnold in action with Leicester City&apos;s Youri Tielemans. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters Updated at 8.16pm BST 8.07pm BST 7 min Corner to Leicester – well defended again. 8.06pm BST 6 min Cody Gakpo gets into two good positions in quick succession. The first sortie is stopped by a fine tackle, the second by the offside flag. 8.05pm BST 5 min Leicester, who have been sparky, win a free kick on the right this time, much to Jordan Henderson’s distaste. It’s cleared and the whistle has gone anyway. 8.03pm BST 3 min The ball gets into the Liverpool box, curling in from a free kick on the left. Nobody gets a touch, but the man who comes closest is Evans. Updated at 8.04pm BST 8.02pm BST 2 min Mo Salah may have had a Red Bull. He’s already played a through ball and then, when it headed back towards him, nicked it off the nearest midfielder. 8.00pm BST 1 min Liverpool kick off and the King Power is rocking. 7.58pm BST Jonny Evans leads Leicester out. It’s great to see him back – a case of desperate times, sensible measures. The Leicester and Liverpool players line-up before kick off. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA Updated at 8.09pm BST 7.50pm BST “Nunez,” says Jeff Sax. “Pity he is not playing with his stubbed toe, it may improve his completion percentages.” Oof! It is a shame he couldn’t make it: he’s so watchable. 7.48pm BST Anyone remember what happened the last time these sides met? I suspect Wout Faes does. He scored twice in eight minutes and still ended up losing 2-1. Updated at 7.57pm BST 7.45pm BST Roger Kirkby is back for more. “Prose is my middle name,” he says. “Just googled ‘squeaky stair time’ and it’s original – should I trademark it?” Yes! And have a word with Dave O’Gorman. 7.37pm BST “Nunez has a toe injury but is in the stands, so I hear,” says Patrick Crumlish. “Stubbed it against the table getting up from playing Xbox?” Ha. The first few words of this have been confirmed by Liverpool. 7.19pm BST “This game,” says Roger Kirkby, “has everything for the neutral. Liverpool win, it’s exciting at the top. Leicester win, it’s exciting at the bottom. A draw is squeaky stair time for both teams – the bogeyman is coming for ya.” That’s the first time I’ve ever seen the word “stair” when I was expecting “bum”. 7.17pm BST Those changes in full As well as Evans, who replaces Caglar Soyuncu, Dean Smith brings back Ricardo Pereira and Wilfred Ndidi. Victor Kristiansen and Dennis Praet drop to the bench. Jurgen Klopp makes two changes, recalling Jordan Henderson and Luis Diaz in place of Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez. Jota is on the bench, Nunez nowhere to be seen, so maybe he’s injured. 7.10pm BST The teams Leicester (4-3-3): Iversen; Ricardo Pereira, Faes, Evans, Castagne; Tielemans, Ndidi, Soumare; Maddison, Vardy, Barnes. Subs: Smithies, Souttar, Kristiansen, Amartey, Mendy, Praet, Thomas, Tete, Daka. Liverpool (4-3-3): Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Jones; Salah, Gakpo, Diaz. Subs: Kelleher, Gomez, Matip, Tsimikas, Carvalho, Arthur, Milner, Elliott, Jota. Referee: Craig Pawson. Updated at 7.25pm BST 7.06pm BST Heeeeere&apos;s Jonny! Yes, Jonny Evans is back in the centre of Leicester’s defence after being injured for seven months. His absence may have sabotaged their season: is his return just in time to save it? 7.03pm BST Preamble Hello everyone and welcome to the edge of your seat. On planet maths, both these clubs can afford to lose. On planet earth, neither can: Liverpool almost certainly have to win to stay in contention for the top four, and Leicester surely have to get a point to stay in the Premier League. Even that would only drag Leicester up to 18th, so they have to go for the win that would lift them above Everton and out of the bottom three. They are far too good to be 19th. With all those players who are still talked about as transfer targets, from James Maddison to Youri Tielemans, they have truly been Leics than the sum of their parts. Five weeks ago you might have said much the same about Liverpool. On 11 April they were lying eighth with 44 points from 29 games – but the last of those 44 proved to be a turning point. From 2-0 down at home to Arsenal, Liverpool rallied to 2-2 and since then they haven’t looked back. Only two teams have won their last six games in the Prem: Man City and Liverpool, those old friends. On form they will sweep Leicester aside, with Trent Alexander-Arnold running the show from his new home as an inverted right-back. But funny things happen at the end of the season and Leicester have shown the odd flicker of their former selves, with Jamie Vardy suddenly remembering where the goal is. Over the past six games, they may have managed only five points, but that’s one more than Chelsea or Spurs. It’s so tight at the bottom, Southampton apart, that one win can make all the difference. Forest got theirs last Monday: can their neighbours follow suit? We will find out from 8pm onwards. Back soon with the teams.</body>

    <body>Days after announcing a new CEO at Twitter, Elon Musk has turned his eye to Tesla, ordering managers to clear all hires at the electric car maker through him. Musk communicated the decision in a memo to Tesla staff on Monday, according to documents obtained by The Information. Related: ‘The Velvet Hammer’: who is Twitter’s new CEO and can she fix its problems? Musk asked Tesla managers to send him a weekly list of all proposed hires, including contractors, and to “think carefully” about anything being proposed, according to the report. Musk has given out similar directives in the past, the publication said, with staff reporting that the practice has at times been tantamount to a hiring freeze. Also on Monday, a federal appeals court rejected the billionaire’s plea to modify or end a 2018 settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that required some of his tweets to get advance approval from a Tesla lawyer. Musk had appealed to end the requirement, charging that having to pre-clear his tweets was a “government-imposed muzzle” that violated his free speech rights. Musk had agreed to the reviews in 2018 as part of a consent decree to end a federal case accusing him of defrauding investors with a tweet that he had “funding secured” to take his electric car company private at $420 a share. The funding never materialised and the company was never taken private. Shareholders and the SEC charged that Musk’s tweet drove up share prices and ultimately contributed to losses taken by some shareholders. In addition to agreeing to have some tweets screened, Musk and Tesla each also paid $20m in civil fines and Musk gave up his role as chairman as a result of the SEC case. Musk’s request to end that arrangement was initially denied by a Manhattan federal court judge who ruled in 2022 that the requirement did not need to be lifted just because Musk no longer wanted to adhere to it now that Tesla had “become, in his estimation, all but invincible”. On Monday, a three-judge panel of the second US circuit court of appeals affirmed that ruling, noting that Musk’s tweets have continued to raise business controversies, even despite the reviews. The ruling said the SEC had opened two subsequent inquiries into Musk tweets that “plausibly violated” the settlement’s terms. It also said Musk agreed to the settlement allowing screening of his tweets and had no right to void it now “because he has now changed his mind”. “Had Musk wished to preserve his right to tweet without even limited internal oversight concerning certain Tesla-related topics, he had the right to litigate … or to negotiate a different agreement – but he chose not to do so,” the panel wrote in the ruling. “Nor does the public interest require modification of the consent decree. If anything, it cuts in the other direction, given the importance of the public’s interest in the enforcement of federal securities laws … ” In February, a San Francisco jury found Musk not liable for investor losses over his “funding secured” tweet. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, told Reuters: “We will seek further review and continue to bring attention to the important issue of the government constraint on speech.” Musk, who bought Twitter last year for $44bn, last week confirmed Linda Yaccarino will take over as chief executive of the social media company. Yaccarino previously served as NBCUniversal’s head of global advertising. Musk tweeted on Friday that Yaccarino will focus on business operations while he will concentrate on product design and new technology. Reuters contributed to this report</body>

    <head>Succession recap: season four, episode eight – nothing is more sadistic than the words ‘Is that even true?’</head>
    <body>Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Succession season four. Don’t read on unless you’ve watched episode eight. A pressure-cooker episode, largely set in ATN HQ on its first post-Logan election night, saw the quad squad at war. Here are the exit polls for the eighth episode, titled America Decides … Busted back down to Greg level We began with ATN boss Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) juggling a chaotic newsroom with demands from his in-laws to deliver blockbuster ratings. He admitted to being “a little bit tense” from last night’s marital strife. Comfy shoes, adult diapers and double shot coffees were required, as was a bump of cocaine from cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun). Definitely no “bodega sushi”, though. Not for Tightrope Tom-Wom’s refined palate. Greg was not-so-fresh from his night on the tiles with GoJo mogul Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård), who’d made him visit “unseemly” venues, “dance with a confused old man” and “drink things that aren’t normally drinks”. He had, however, learned about Shiv’s secret alliance with the striking Viking. Knowledge is power, said Tom, but tonight he wanted the leggy princeling “Gregging for me” again. Latest polling predicted a tight race, with Democrat candidate Daniel Jiménez (Elliot Villar) edging it … but a night is a long time in politics. It’s even longer on a rolling news channel with malfunctioning touchscreens and micro-managing CEOs. Smileys v eggplants Flirting with the neo-Nazis … Roman (Kieran Culkin). Photograph: HBO Upstairs in the VIP suite, the Roy siblings clashed over consequences of the result – for themselves, for the firm and, far less importantly, for the country. Shiv (Sarah Snook) was texted an optimistic “four smileys” by Jiménez’s running mate, Gil Eavis. Roman (Kieran Culkin) received “eggplant, eggplant, flag” from alt-right rival Jeryd Mencken (Justin Kirk). This would become a running theme: liberal Shiv scurrying off to check in with the Dems, Romulus flirting with the neo-Nazis. He wanted ATN to Trumpishly claim voter fraud. She wanted it to report on civil unrest and voter intimidation. He took impish delight in winding up his sis by dismissing such concerns as “false flags”. If Jiménez won, his administration would probably wave through Waystar’s acquisition by GoJo, leaving the brothers with the board and shareholders nixing the deal as their last hope of retaining ownership. “Good for democracy and great for us,” Shiv told co-conspirator Matsson. When Kendall (Jeremy Strong) wished Jiménez luck and nudged him to “rein in tech” once in power, he got short shrift. Roman had more joy with kindred spirit Mencken. They agreed on “what assholes would call a narrative”. If he lost, Mencken wanted it “characterised as a huge victory”, laying groundwork for the next election. If he won, he’d refer the sale to regulators in exchange for ATN’s explicit backing. So it came to pass. Shiv’s bombshell fizzles Amid the mayhem, Shiv collared Tom for a corridor tête-à-tête. Roys rarely apologise, but she said sorry for “some of the things I said last night” and gave Tom “the opportunity to retract” too. Except he didn’t. Emotionally detached Tom sneered that she was merely worried he’d blab about her Matsson alliance, cruelly adding: “You hated your dad and kind of killed him.” As a last resort, reeling Shiv shared the news she has been sitting on for four episodes: “Also, actually, I’m pregnant. By you.” That’s one question answered. Tom blankly asked if it was “even true” or a negotiating tactic. Poleaxed by his cold, sadistic reaction, Shiv stormed off. She took out her frustrations on punchbag Greg, wrongfooting the babbling beanpole by asking if he found her attractive, before threatening him to keep her double-dealing on the downlow. But as we know, morally flexible Greg’s hardly rock solid. We didn’t start the fire When a Milwaukee voting count centre was firebombed and evacuated, ATN’s touchpaper was similarly lit. Roman waved it off as “antifa” or “an electrical fire”. Shiv and old flame Nate Sofrelli (Ashley Zukerman), part of Team Jiménez, wanted it pinned on pro-Mencken extremists. Caught in the middle, Tom desperately tried to keep the Roys off the newsroom floor. No more bodega sushi! … Darwin (Adam Godley) gets a bad case of wasabi in the eye. Photograph: Home Box Office But Roman had had enough of experts. He steamrollered resident polling guru Darwin (British actor Adam Godley) into calling Wisconsin for Mencken, despite ballots being lost in the blaze. To add injury to insult, “human abacus” Darwin got wasabi in his eyes, which hapless Greg tried to wash out with lemonade. The slapstick came as a respite from the relentless tension. While Jiménez urged the media to “respect the process” and wait until all votes could be counted, Romulus ordered ATN’s Nazi-sympathising anchor Mark Ravenhead (Zack Robidas) to go full Tucker Carlson, ranting on-air about “woke conspiracies” against “traditional values”. As Shiv watched aghast and Kendall seemed depressively inert, ATN lurched even further to the right. When Arizona went red too, Roman pushed hard to call the election for Mencken. Kendall urged caution but Roman argued that putting their man in the West Wing was what their father would have done. It would kill the deal and was all upside, bar the small matter of the country burning. Dwelling on his daughter’s recent brush with a racist Ravenhead acolyte, Kendall consulted his sis. Except Shiv secretly had skin in the game. Sitting in the Potus position Roused from his stupor, Kendall levelled with Shiv. He admitted he was tempted to seize sole control of the company and felt threatened by Roman’s relationship with Mencken. However, stopping Matsson remained his priority. Shiv warned against giving Mencken the legitimacy to declare himself president, not least because if the courts reversed the Wisconsin result, they’d be discredited as a news organisation. She reassured Kendall he was “a good guy”, appealing to his sense of decency. He asked Shiv to see one last time if the Democrats could block the GoJo takeover too. Cue a killer twist. Wanting to preserve the deal in exchange for a powerful position in the newly merged company, Shiv only pretended to phone Nate. Under pressure to make a decision, Kendall tried Nate himself. Horrified Shiv was powerless to stop him. In a squirm-inducing scene that seemed to unfold in slow motion, Kendall realised she’d lied and got confirmation from Greg that she was aligned with Matsson. Partly out of expediency and partly to spite her, he agreed to call it for Mencken. Cue a chillingly fascistic victory speech, with “Hocus Potus” saying he’d been anointed by “an authority of known integrity”. Ahem. Everyone except Roman was shellshocked. PA Jess (Juliana Canfield) looked fearful. Kendall wanted to reassure his kids. Tom was scapegoated by left-leaning Pierce Global News (“ATN head blasted for premature projection”). “We just made a good night of TV,” shrugged Roman nihilistically after taking a grateful call from Mencken. “That’s all. Nothing happens.” “Things do happen, Rome,” said Shiv, eyes ablaze. She advised Matsson to go public with GoJo’s subscriber scandal, burying bad news amid the election fallout, and vowed to “do a number” on her brothers. The sibs were on a war footing. Again. The Conheads aren’t coming Whither the dynasty’s own White House wannabe? Egged on by wife Willa (Justine Lupe), spare part sibling Connor (Alan Ruck) complained that ATN were filming him but the footage wasn’t making it to air. Well, duh. His best bet for making his paltry supporter base count was Kentucky. When Mencken won it, Connor asked Roman if a cushy job might still be on offer. In return, he could “concede in Mencken’s direction”. Keen to maintain momentum, Mencken agreed to make Connor ambassador to Slovenia. Now all he needed to do was make a statesmanlike concession speech live on-air. It soon descended into Father Ted-style swipes at those who’d wronged him and defiance about his inherited wealth (“The politics of envy are ugly. I happen to be a billionaire, sorry”). He couldn’t even do defeat properly. The heir apparent With kingmaker Roman set to have a direct line into the Oval Office and an agreement from Mencken to block the takeover, he came out on top. Kendall’s “reverse Viking” plan remains cooking on the back burner. Line of the week Roman wisecracked at warp speed and Kendall’s “goose trying to shit a housebrick” merits a mention. Yet the prize goes to Tom’s advice to Greg: “Information is like a bottle of fine wine. You store it, you hoard it, you save it for a special occasion – and then you smash someone’s fucking face in with it.” Hopefully it’s not biodynamic German red with the bouquet of wet dog. Notes and observations This episode was written by Jesse Armstrong, who steers his ship home by penning the final three instalments. Next week’s is titled Church and State, set at a certain funeral. A low profile for the “greybeards” again, with Frank, Karl and Hugo reduced to heckling from the balcony like Statler and Waldorf. Gerri will presumably return for the funeral, alongside exes Marcia and Lady Caroline. Note how Connor’s campaign slogan, with delicious double meaning, was “Enough already!”. Jiménez’s was the Obama-esque “Let’s do this!”. Will Mencken’s mob storm the Capitol? Will revenge be sweet for Shiv? Rejoin us here next Monday. In the meantime, normalists, stay hydrated and leave your thoughts below.</body>

    <head>Curtis Jones double for Liverpool damages Leicester’s survival hopes</head>
    <body>Jürgen Klopp had said there are five million ways to win a game and in a routine victory that ensures Manchester United can feel Liverpool breathing down their necks, Trent Alexander-Arnold exhibited one of the finer ways in which to score a goal. Alexander-Arnold emphatically sealed victory with a stunning free-kick and he could have hardly picked a better moment given Gareth Southgate and his assistant, Steve Holland, were among those in attendance. Related: Leicester City 0-3 Liverpool: Premier League – live Alexander-Arnold, who again played as an inverted full-back, popping up centrally, arrowed his strike into the top corner, cementing a seventh straight win after a neat double by Curtis Jones. Liverpool railroaded lowly Leicester, scoring twice inside three first-half minutes, to earn a healthy buffer and Alexander-Arnold capped victory after the returning Jonny Evans, the Leicester club captain, was deemed to have fouled Jordan Henderson, his Liverpool counterpart. The only shock was Mohamed Salah firing wide on 79 minutes after being freed as Liverpool went in search of a fourth goal. Liverpool’s late push to qualify for the Champions League continues to gather pace but Leicester’s thoughts lay firmly elsewhere. If Leicester are to avoid relegation, a team that has won one of their previous 15 matches, must win one – if not both – of their remaining games. And even then that may prove insufficient. For a reminder of how the outlook has changed for Leicester, on this day two years ago they were cavorting with the FA Cup after lifting the trophy for the first time in their history at Wembley. Five of the starting lineup from that day, which was played in front of a limited 20,000 crowd owing to the pandemic, also began here, including Evans, who made his first league start since October after a hamstring complaint. Evans initially seemed to provide a welcome calm but two quick Liverpool goals soon shifted even the slightest sense of comfort. Now Leicester are staring at relegation to the Championship, seven years on from their unthinkable 5000-1 title win. The galling thing for interim manager Dean Smith is that until Jones’s first goal, on 33 minutes, Leicester had kept Liverpool at arm’s length. Luis Díaz, one of two Liverpool changes from victory over Brentford last time out, skittled a shot against the side netting a few minutes earlier. Then a long ball downfield by Alisson altered the picture. Wout Faes did not deal with the ball and Díaz was first to the punch. Henderson, Klopp’s other change, found Salah, who sent a cross towards the back post. By the time Boubakary Soumaré spied Jones in his peripheral vision it was too late and Jones arrived to sweep the ball in first time with his left foot. It was a painful goal from a Leicester perspective but the pain was about to get much worse. Cody Gakpo accelerated clear of Wilfred Ndidi and Soumaré on halfway and played in Salah, who fed the roaming Jones with a cute pass. Jones collected the ball on his right foot, swivelled and promptly smacked the ball beyond Daniel Iversen with his next touch. By now – with 36 minutes on the clock – any grains of belief had been shredded. A couple of Leicester supporters headed for the concourses. Liverpool would have added a third seconds later, straight from the restart, but for Iversen’s instinctive stop to deny Gakpo. Smith placed his hands on his head as Gakpo soared through on goal. At that point Smith recognised his team were “frazzled” and needed half-time to “clear their heads”. The slate-grey skies at half-time married with a bleak forecast for Leicester, who visit Newcastle before hosting Brighton on the final day. Last week, after a humiliating defeat at Fulham, Smith cancelled the players’ day off and this week the end-of-season awards night was canned. The Leicester chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, naturally struck an upbeat tone in his programme notes. “I feel sure our fate will be determined by our own actions,” he said, but failure to yield victory means they will be relying on their rivals to do them a favour or two from here. Alisson had to make the first notable save of the second half. Harvey Barnes exchanged passes with Jamie Vardy and then Youri Tielemans before picking the ball up on the edge of the Liverpool 18-yard box. Trent Alexander-Arnold seals Liverpool’s win with a stunning strike. Photograph: Daniel Chesterton/Offside/Getty Images Barnes took aim with his right foot but Alisson flew to his left and pushed a curling shot wide with a strong right hand. Leicester’s lax defending always offered Liverpool encouragement and Díaz was allowed to trickle an inviting ball across the six-yard box. The full-back Ricardo Pereira, who scored to send Leicester into a first European semi-final 13 months ago, was unsurprisingly rusty on his return from injury. Luckily for Leicester, no red shirts were on hand to prod in. But when Evans felled Henderson how Liverpool feasted on the opportunity to add a third goal. Salah back-heeled a free-kick half a yard into the path of Alexander-Arnold, who lashed an unstoppable right-foot strike high into the top corner. Alexander-Arnold wheeled away and embarked on a knee slide in front of the pocket of Liverpool supporters who had been singing Roberto Firmino’s name on loop. It was time to turn up the volume.</body>

    <head>Steeltown Murders review – the hunt for the Saturday Night Strangler could not be more timely TV</head>
    <body>Which will we run out of first? Stories about historical police failures/corruption, or audiences with whom such stories will still resonate now that we have moved so far beyond such horrors that they are almost unfathomable? It’s a trick question, of course! The answer is – neither! With every new day’s headlines, a time when police haplessness (at best) and venality (at worst) will become lost to the past rather than desperately resonant with the present seems a greater impossibility. Steeltown Murders, based on real life events investigated dangerously poorly in the 1970s by various factions of the South Wales police force, feels as relevant as ever, as we wade through the latest reports of derelictions of duty by the Met and their regional brethren. When the march of science makes new DNA evidence available on the 25-year-old unsolved murders of two 16-year-old girls, Geraldine Hughes and Pauline Floyd (Calista Davies and Jade Croot), by a man who became known as the “Saturday Night Strangler”, two of the original detectives are assigned to carry out a re-investigation, along with a newcomer, DC Geraint Bale (Gareth John Bale). The man in charge and still gnawed at by past mistakes from when he was a junior officer on the case, DCI Paul Bethell, is played by Philip Glenister (producing his usual effortless-looking everyman performance – though the Welsh accent is less convincing). His righthand man is Phil “Bach” Rees (Steffan Rhodri) and together they reapply themselves to the problem of solving the case and to connecting it, as Bethell always suspected, to the case of 16-year-old Sandra Newton, similarly raped and murdered on her way home from a nightclub. In an extended flashback, with the younger Bethell played by Scott Arthur and younger Rees by Siôn Alun Davies, who do themselves proud, we see the methods and attitudes that hampered the first investigation. Sandra was having an affair with a married man called John Dilwyn Morgan and the officers fixated on him as the prime suspect at the expense of other possibilities. Bethell’s attempts to shake their attention loose get him relegated to minor duties, and his suggestion that they look at Sandra’s stepfather Dai (Keith Allen) is ignored (although this was a red herring – he was not the killer). Geraldine and Pauline are considered to be “nicer” girls, and more resources are allocated to finding their killer (though the lead detective turns down help from Scotland Yard, seemingly for reasons of national pride). The twin timelines are, for once, necessary and illuminating. We see how scientific progress – the case develops into one that deploys for the first time the use of familial DNA tracing to determine the killer – can still be hindered by stasis or regression elsewhere; for example, the re-investigation, which requires an extensive swabbing programme of men who lived in the right areas as the right times, is hampered by swingeing cuts being experienced by the forces. And, although the chief constable is now a woman, misogyny (gasp!) persists, as does its shaping of how the murders were perceived. It asks questions about how much we can ask of trauma victims – Rees is reluctant to let Bethell question a suspected rape victim of one of their suspects so many years on – and how much closure can be brought to suffering. The drama was written by Ed Whitmore, who was responsible for the utterly bleak, utterly brilliant retelling of another murderous real-life tale a few years ago in Rillington Place, starring a seethingly malevolent Tim Roth as Reg Christie, and a stricken Samantha Morton as his wife. Whitmore does full justice to the painstaking and never glamorous policework that finally found the Saturday Night Strangler, and the difference integrity makes to a job and to a life. More importantly, it does so without ever losing sight of the shock, the intensity of the loss created by a man who, like so many, should have been stopped before he escalated to murder, and the endurance of the grief he caused. It takes its time but never flags or becomes ponderous (thanks to Marc Evans’ directorial talents, as well as the dense script, and it takes its responsibilities to the living and to the dead seriously. Steeltown Murders is on BBC One and iPlayer. • This article was amended on 16 May 2023. A previous version incorrectly stated that this investigation involved Dyfed-Powys police.</body>

    <head>Morning Mail: rental nightmares, new anti-fraud tool for banks, Labor strong in post-budget poll</head>
    <body>Good morning. Our top story breaks down the results of the latest Guardian Essential poll which has the Albanese government maintaining a commanding lead over the Coalition. But poll respondents were not convinced that last week’s budget will ease cost-of-living pressure or create jobs.

    <head>Tottenham’s top three for sporting director features Tim Steidten</head>
    <body>Tottenham’s preferred three candidates for their sporting director role include Tim Steidten, who has held similar jobs at Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen. Steidten is out of work after leaving Leverkusen in March, just under four years after he joined from Bremen to head the scouting department. He was promoted from that role by Leverkusen last July. Brentford’s technical director Lee Dykes is also prominent in Tottenham’s thoughts but it would require substantial compensation to bring him across London. Dykes took up his position last summer after three years leading Brentford’s recruitment department.

Brentford are in advanced talks to sign the Freiburg goalkeeper Mark Flekken, whose contract has a €13m (£11.3m) release clause. He is regarded as the successor to David Raya, who has turned down a new deal and is expected to leave. Brentford want £40m for the Spaniard, who hopes to stay in the Premier League. Tottenham’s search for a sporting director continues. A lack of clarity over who could fill the role prompted Julian Nagelsmann to tell the club he was not able to consider taking the manager’s job.</body>

    <head>Punishing heatwave grips Pacific north-west as wildfires rage in western Canada</head>
    <body>A punishing heatwave will continue to cook the Pacific north-west this week, after millions of people endured a weekend of temperatures that pushed past 90F (32C) and broke early spring records in several cities. Related: Satellite images show California’s ‘ghost lake’ reappearing after sodden winter The hot, dry weather is fuelling dozens of wildfires across western Canada, where thousands have been evacuated and more than a million acres have already burned. Temperatures are dropping but forecasters with the National Weather Service warned on Monday that they would remain “between 20-30 degrees above average in the Pacific Northwest throughout this week”. Heat advisories remain in effect in areas of Oregon and Washington into Monday evening. “It’s already warm outside,” the National Weather Service in Seattle tweeted early on Monday morning, highlighting that the city was on track to set a record high for the fourth day in a row. The morning low had already tied for the warmest in May on record. The weekend weather delivered a spattering of new heat records as temperatures in the typically balmy region climbed higher than those in desert-bound Las Vegas. Eugene, Oregon, reached 94F on Sunday, pushing past a record set in 1939. Portland, Oregon came in at 92F, while Squamish, British Colombia, smashed records with a 96F day. The heat also exacerbated conditions where firefighters across Alberta, Canada, continue to battle 88 active wildfires, 23 of which remain listed as “out of control” by officials on Monday morning. Smoke rises from the Bald Mountain Fire in the Grande Prairie forest area near Alberta, Canada. Photograph: Alberta Wildfire/Reuters “Unseasonably hot weather will persist over coastal BC through this week,” Canadian forecasters wrote in a special weather statement on Monday morning, warning locals that the risks of heat-related illnesses will increase with sustained elevated temperatures. Those who live in these cooler areas are unaccustomed to sharp shifts in temperature, which can make them more threatening to vulnerable populations and many homes in the region are not equipped with cooling systems. The heatwave, while dangerous, will not be the worst the region has weathered. Officials were clear to make distinctions between this week’s warnings and 2021’s deadly heat dome, when more than 800 people died in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia after temperatures spiked in late June and early July that year. Soaring to an all-time high of 116F (46.7C) in Portland, heat records were smashed in cities and towns across the region, as marine ecosystems baked and crops scorched. But climate models show the region will continue to warm in the coming years, posing new dangers to residents and ecosystems alike. Fueled by the climate crisis, dangerous heatwaves that last longer and cover more ground are becoming more likely. Inextricably tied to wildfires, the extreme weather is also expected to spur more devastating blazes in a region that is already primed to burn. “Fire isn’t going away,” John Vaillant, author of the book Fire Weather recently told the Guardian, adding that this will be a century of burning as the world warms. “This is a global shift. It’s an epochal shift and we happen to be alive for it.” Leyland Cecco and the Associated Press contributed reporting</body>

    <head>PFA seeks advice on legal protections for players during pitch invasions</head>
    <body>The Professional Footballers’ Association has sought legal advice over whether players attacked by supporters can use reasonable force to defend themselves, the Guardian can reveal. It comes amid heightened concerns of further incidents during the English Football League playoff second legs and the final fortnight of the Premier League season, after the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, was confronted on Saturday by a Leeds supporter. Related: Chelsea keen on Napoli’s Victor Osimhen for rebuild under Pochettino It is understood there is growing concern among some PFA members over an apparent lack of legal protections for players – and also what would constitute “reasonable force” if a player feels under threat during a crowd invasion. The PFA has promised in an email to its members, seen by the Guardian, to back its players if there is any incident. “As your trade union, we are here to support you and we have taken legal guidance on your rights in the event of mass pitch invasions such as those that occurred last year,” the email states. “Harassment, assaults and attacks by spectators are never justified and they are never the ‘fault’ of the player.” It is understood particular concerns were raised by PFA members after the court case involving Oli McBurnie following the Nottingham Forest v Sheffield United game at the end of last season, where Sheffield United’s Billy Sharp was assaulted. McBurnie was cleared of stamping on a pitch-invading fan. Several other players and staff were attacked or harassed by spectators during large-scale pitch invasions at last year’s playoffs and when Everton avoided relegation from the Premier League, leading players to express a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of stewarding and the management of pitch invasions. Last July the Premier League, EFL and Football Association announced that pitch invaders would be banned from stadiums and reported to police. Much to the PFA’s apparent frustration, incidents have continued this season, including when Bradford’s Andy Cook was confronted by a Stevenage supporter after he scored in February. In January the Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale was kicked at Tottenham by a fan who had made his way on to the perimeter barrier. The playoff second legs begin on Tuesday. The PFA has reminded players of their rights to be informed of security plans and to take action if they believe the environment is unsafe. “We have been very clear with the authorities that too many of these incidents are still happening, with players left to look after themselves and stewards and security often too slow to respond,” its email says.</body>

    <head>Northampton teacher who stabbed her partner denies killing was ‘revenge’</head>
    <body>A primary school teacher who stabbed her partner in the neck and buried his body in their back garden has denied the killing was “revenge” for a suspected affair. Fiona Beal, 49, told a court she could not remember moving Nicholas Billingham’s van, using his phone to view online pornography, ordering a wood burner, or changing her council tax status from double to single occupancy after his death. She also claimed she had no memory of using the 42-year-old’s credit card to renew her TV licence nine days after he is believed to have been killed. The crown alleges Beal got Billingham to wear an eye mask before stabbing him in their bedroom in a planned attack on 1 November 2021. The year 6 teacher, from Northampton, denies the charge of murder, claiming her “broken” mental state means she is guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter. During cross-examination by the prosecutor, Steven Perian KC, at Northampton crown court on Monday, Beal said she did not know what had happened to Billingham’s clothing, belongings and credit cards. “I don’t remember what room I killed him in,” she said. “I remember dragging something heavy into the garden but it’s not a clear memory.” Asked whether she had used Billingham’s phone to view pornography online after his death, Beal told the court: “It would have to be me, yes. “I think at this point I was using [Billingham’s phone and her own] interchangeably. I don’t think it was a conscious decision to use either phone.” Beal also told the jury she was smoking about 10 joints of cannabis on non-school days at the time of the killing. When it was put to her that the killing had “nothing to do with cannabis use”, she replied: “I don’t know.” She then rejected the suggestion she had killed Billingham because she suspected he was having an affair, saying: “No. There had been plenty of affairs over the years.” Perian asked: “This was a revenge killing, wasn’t it?” “No,” Beal replied. The court also heard that, after messaging her son in December 2021, Billingham’s mother had received a reply saying he was “back selling cars and happy” and wishing her a happy new year. Beal, whose evidence is expected to finish later this week, admitted sending the reply and acknowledged that it “wasn’t a kind thing to do”. She said she did not recall using her late partner’s phone to send a message to his cousin in the early hours of 1 January last year. Responding to a suggestion by Perian that a “confession book” found shortly before her arrest was a written record of what she had done, Beal said: “No, I say it’s just a journal.” The trial was adjourned until Thursday.</body>

    <head>Intensive farming is biggest cause of bird decline in Europe, study says</head>
    <body>The use of pesticides and fertilisers in intensive agriculture is the biggest cause of the dwindling number of birds in the UK and the rest of Europe, scientists have said. Compared with a generation ago, 550 million fewer birds fly over the continent, with their decline well documented. But until now the relative importance of various pressures on bird populations was not known. A team of more than 50 researchers, analysing data collected by thousands of citizen scientists in 28 countries over nearly four decades, found that it is intensive agriculture, above all, that is behind the decline in the continent’s bird populations. They found the number of wild birds of all kinds across the continent has fallen by more than a quarter since 1980, but that this decline deepened to more than half among farmland species. Birds that rely on invertebrates for food, including swifts, yellow wagtails and spotted flycatchers, were the hardest hit. “It’s more than a smoking gun,” said Richard Gregory, a senior conservation scientist at the RSPB, and one of the lead authors of the study. “I don’t think a study has looked at all these factors in one go, in such a sophisticated fashion, correcting for one variable alongside another; and it comes out with a very clear message.” The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined how 170 bird species had responded to four widespread manmade pressures, including agricultural intensification, forest cover change, urbanisation and the climate crisis. Farmland species suffered the most precipitous decline, with numbers falling by 56.8% since research began, the study said. Numbers of urban dwelling birds were down 27.8%, and among woodland dwelling birds the fall was 17.7%. But in all contexts, intensive agriculture, which has been on the rise across Europe, was identified as a major factor in decline, with the mass slaughter of invertebrates as pests creating a “trophic cascade” up the food chain. “The losses are quite huge,” Gregory said. “And a lot of them go back to that kind of an insect diet or linkage with insects, which is suggestive of a link to the way we’re farming land.” Urbanisation, also on the increase across Europe, was identified as the next most important factor putting pressure on bird populations. Many cities are steadily losing to development what little plots of green space they had, while modern architecture also played a role, Gregory said. “We know many of the urban birds – the swifts, the house martins, the house sparrows, the starlings – that live in those environments, that their numbers are declining very strongly, driven we think by the problems in relation to the food supplies, but also house construction and how that’s changing, how the modernisation is removing their natural kind of nest sites in those areas,” Gregory said. Northern, cold-preferring species of birds were also found to be under heavy pressure, with numbers down 39.7% as temperatures rise across Europe as a result of the climate crisis. Changing temperatures had winners as well as losers, the study noted, with numbers among southern warm-preferring species down only 17.1%. The researchers wrote: “Overall, while temperature change can lead to an increase in the distribution and abundance of some species, for those (especially cold dwellers) already affected by other anthropogenic pressures, temperature change constitutes a double burden acting directly on their annual cycle.” Related: ‘You sometimes feel like Noah’: the London zoo team bidding to save doomed species Only “the rapid implementation of transformative change in European societies, and especially in agricultural reform” could save the continent’s bird populations, the researchers said. They added: “This paper contributes to the highest political and technical challenge faced by agricultural policy in Europe, struggling to balance high productivity from intensive agricultural practices with environmental protection, and the results are therefore crucial to policymakers, scientists, and the general public concerned with biodiversity and global change issues.” Their call was echoed by Alice Groom, the RSPB’s head of sustainable land use policy in England. She said: “Increasing our reliance on pesticides and fertiliser has allowed us to farm more intensively and increase output, but, as this study clearly shows, at a huge cost to our wildlife and the health of the environment. “The UK and devolved governments should ensure agri-environment schemes reward nature-friendly farming practices such as flower-rich margins and herbal leys that are proven to enable farmers to produce good food whilst supporting progressive reductions in the use of pesticides and fertilisers.”</body>

    <head>‘America is broken’: FBI criticized for mass-shooting survival video</head>
    <body>A newly resurfaced FBI video purportedly training Americans to give themselves their best chance of surviving a deadly mass shooting is drawing scorn across the US and abroad. In the video, released in 2020 by the US’s top law enforcement agency, actors portraying everyday Americans explain to viewers ways in which they could at least survive – or, preferably, even stop – a mass shooting once the bullets start flying. Related: ‘He was certainly a racist’: J Edgar Hoover and a history of white nationalism “If European countries want to deter brain drain to the US they should just play this FBI video to their soon-to-be graduates,” the European tech investor Michael Jackson said on his LinkedIn profile, which has more than 134,000 followers. Jackson, who shared a link to the video, added that the well-documented gun problem in the US – where rates of mass gun violence are much higher than they are in Europe and in many other parts of the world – was hurting its standing with tourists and its companies’ prospects of hiring talented employees from overseas. Another typical reaction to the video was on Twitter from an Oklahoma scholarship foundation leader who wrote: “America is broken. Instead of addressing the cause of the carnage, we’re talking about how to survive a massacre like it’s a damn tornado.” The video begins with a scene of a bustling bar filled with people. A fight breaks out and then the sudden eruption of gunshots sends the crowd into a panic, with people rushing to find an exit or a hiding spot. A waitress spots a neon red exit sign and proceeds to explain to viewers techniques to avoid getting shot. “Running makes you harder to hit and improves your chances of survival,” she says as she runs down a stairway with a group of people. When she makes it downstairs and out the door, she is confronted by police pointing a gun at her. Still out of breath and distressed, the waitress reminds the camera to always keep “empty hands up” and “follow their instructions” when faced with law enforcement. Another woman hiding under a table then says to find another room and barricade the door if it’s not possible to escape. She ushers every person around her into a nearby closet and reminds viewers to turn their phones off. She then says to find anything that could be wielded as if it were a weapon – a fire extinguisher or a flower vase would do – and prepare to attack if the shooter breaks down the door. “Lock and barricade the door,” she instructs viewers as the gunshots can be heard firing in the background. It doesn’t address what to do if the attacker has a high-powered rifle and can fire through the door and walls enclosing the room. Someone is later shown not having a tourniquet but still properly applying pressure to a woman with a bleeding gunshot wound. Toward the end of the video, a man is shown trapped behind the bar with all exits blocked. He tells his audience: “I gotta stay hidden. But I’m no victim. I’m ready for this.” He lays out an elaborate plan that ends with him seizing the shooter’s gun, which occasionally happens but can cost people their lives if attempted unsuccessfully. The video ends with a narrator offering a word of encouragement – “you can survive a mass shooting if you’re prepared” – and directs viewers to the website fbi.gov/survive. The video resurfaced recently as the US is on pace this year to set the record for the highest number of mass killings in recent memory, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. The online reference site’s data recently showed the country in 2023 was likely to see 60 mass killings, which involve four or more victims who are slain. There were 31 mass killings in 2019, 21 in 2020, 28 in 2021 and 36 in 2022. As of Monday morning, there had been at least 224 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are injured or killed. Congress has been unable to meaningfully restrict access to guns despite the accelerated pace of mass shootings in the US this year. Actually stopping a mass shooter as a civilian is exceptionally rare, according to Texas State University’s Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center. Less than 3% of more than 430 active attacks in the US ended with a civilian firing back from 2000 to 2021. A bystander who confronted and disarmed an attacker during a mass shooting that left five people dead and 17 others wounded at a Colorado LGBTQ+ club last year was a US army veteran who had previously gone to war. Richard Fierro had served three tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.</body>

    <head>London Irish at risk of Premiership ban after RFU sets deadline for takeover</head>
    <body>London Irish will be suspended from next season’s Premiership unless the proposed takeover by a US consortium is completed by 30 May or the club provides proof of funding for the entire 2023-24 campaign, the Rugby Football Union has warned. The ultimatum from the RFU comes amid fears the protracted takeover will drag on over the summer and into next season, and heightens the prospect of a third club being thrown out of the Premiership in eight months. Related: Sale dreaming of Premiership glory and northern rugby union revival | Gerard Meagher The RFU cited the need for certainty for players, staff and fans of the club and, although insiders have been hopeful the takeover will be completed, the RFU’s intervention is a deeply worrying sign given the impending deadline. For Irish to avoid being kicked out of the Premiership, the takeover must be completed and approved by the RFU with the buyers undertaking to provide all required working capital to meet the club’s obligations for at least next season. Failing that, the Exiles must demonstrate capacity to fund the club next term. Expulsion would be a colossal blow for the Premiership given the demises of Wasps and Worcester this season. This month the current owner, Mick Crossan, finally stepped in to belatedly pay the players’ April wages after the delay led the squad to consider boycotting their final match of the season, to demand physical proof they were insured to take part in it and to consider submitting breach-of-contract letters. It remains to be seen if Crossan can continue to fund the club next term if the takeover is not completed before the RFU’s deadline, given Irish have debts of around £30m and he has been looking to sell all season. That they are tenants of the Gtech Community Stadium makes them a less attractive proposition for investors, though their state-of-the-art training centre in Sunbury is an impressive asset. Well-placed sources have expressed considerable scepticism that the takeover will go through, not least because financial clouds have been looming over Irish since October when staff members began actively seeking alternative employment. Against that backdrop their fifth-place finish was all the more impressive, but a trying campaign has taken its toll and the relief following their final match was apparent. The RFU is evidently desperate to avoid a repeat of the Worcester situation, so too Premiership Rugby which, along with the union and the Rugby Players’ Association, has been applying pressure on Irish to provide certainty. There is desperation to avoid another club going bust even though a 10-team league has been identified as the optimal solution from 2024 onwards. Worcester’s problems surfaced last summer but they were allowed to begin the 2022-23 season, only to be thrown out in October. Wasps soon followed, plunging the Premiership into crisis. An RFU statement read: “If the club fails to meet these conditions it will be suspended from participating in the Premiership [and other competitions] in season 2023-24 to avoid a scenario where the club enters insolvency mid-season, with the corresponding and substantial impact that has on players, staff, and fans, as well as on the remainder of the league.” The RFU went on to say that the deadline was set “to give enough time for the buyers to provide the information needed and for the transaction to complete” but the clock is ticking, given that leaves the buyers only 10 working days. All the more so because the RFU is also under pressure to complete its due diligence after the chief executive, Bill Sweeney, was accused of being “asleep on the job”. Sweeney and Premiership Rugby’s Simon Massie-Taylor were blamed for “failure on an epic scale” at a parliamentary inquiry into the demises of Worcester and Wasps.</body>

    <head>Tories preach baby-making and the facts of life – why does it always come back to sex with these oddballs?</head>
    <body>We’re spoiled. On Saturday we were gifted the Take Control conference of the Conservative Democratic Organisation. A collection of 200 or so weirdos, led by Nadine Dorries and Andrea Jenkyns, whose lives have been devastated by the absence of Boris Johnson. A keening for a flake of his life. A seance, even. Needless to say, Johnson himself couldn’t be bothered to attend in person. Instead sending down a few signed bottles – not ones he had bought, obviously – to be auctioned in his memory. On Monday, for three days only, we are now being treated to the National Conservatism conference. The Nat Cons. A meeting of minds for those who think that Viktor Orbán and Giorgia Meloni might have a point. A coming together of ideologies for the ideologically challenged. The sort of audience where Jordan Peterson would get a hero’s welcome. Not that he bothers with venues as small as the Emmanuel Centre in London these days. So we had to make do with the Tory backbencher Miriam Cates instead as the warmup act. Her message to the faithful was that we needed more babies. Urgently. There were some obvious flaws with this. First, her audience was 75% male. Maybe the women had taken themselves off to side rooms to enthusiastically reproduce. Then there was the question of what kind of babies the UK needed. As Cates was quick to blame immigration for the low birthrate, it’s safe to assume she didn’t think that foreign babies were wanted onboard. Some babies were more equal than others. Cates went on to moan about the current divorce rate. Married people weren’t taking their vows nearly as seriously enough. Far better for a woman to die of exhaustion having eight children she didn’t want than to make her own choices. It wasn’t clear exactly where the homes for all these large families were to be found. Everything was cultural Marxism. She might want to rethink that. Perhaps they could all be put in the houses that the immigrants were now living in. And the immigrants could all go somewhere else. She was all heart. It went without saying she didn’t think the nanny state should be involved in helping women to raise this surfeit of babies. “Conservatism is always common sense,” concluded Cates. Having talked complete bollocks for 20 minutes. More of the same was to follow with Yoram Hazony, a man who passes himself off as an intellectual of the right. He thought that with every passing month you couldn’t but help become more conservative, providing men had been made to do national service. To stop them becoming woke neo-Marxists, apparently. As for women, their greatest contribution to society was to have more babies. Jacob Rees-Mogg at least was off the hook, having already had six children. Even if he has delegated their upbringing to a nanny. His version of conservatism was that he knew best. Then, he always does. Rees-Mogg has yet to discover an issue on which he is wrong. But his insight for the day was that Saint Thomas Aquinas had been a Brexiter at heart. Which might come as news to Tom. We raced through a highly selective account of the last 1,000 years of English history, all of which had been a precursor to that glorious day in June 2016 when the UK voted to leave the EU. We weren’t like the French under Napoleon. We had never had any claims to expansionism. Er … the British empire? Moving on. The housing crisis was caused by planners working from home. Bonkers. Everyone seemed a bit lost and Rees-Mogg was upset there wasn’t more applause. Then came his critique of the present. He didn’t want to criticise the prime minister because that would be disloyal and might lead to discontent in the Tory party. And hence to a Marxist government. Anything left of far-right is Marxist to Jakey. But he hated the government for raising taxes. He hated the retained EU law. He hated the broken promises. Apart from his own. He hated any immigration. He hated that the attempt to gerrymander the vote had failed. And he had been part of the government that had introduced voter ID. Shameless. He’s not even a tribute act any more. The Nat Cons are the only people dumb enough to give him an audience. After a break for lunch, the conference resumed with a keynote speech from Suella Braverman. There were two brief interruptions for Extinction Rebellion protests, which Braverman declared to be auditions for the shadow cabinet. Never a truer word and all that. This wasn’t so much a speech as a leadership bid for a party in opposition. Braverman is the woman to take the Tories from 270 seats down to 160. But at least they will be the right sort of Conservatives. Braverman began with the obligatory 10-minute backstory. Her parents had been hard-working immigrants. Exactly the sort of people she is now committed to keeping out of the country. They would have been astonished that their daughter had become attorney general and home secretary. Not nearly as astonished as the rest of us. Then we came to her beliefs. Such as they were. Braverman is not known for her intellectual hinterland. Those who said Brexit would be an economic catastrophe had been proved wrong. Er … that must be why we have the worst performing economy in the G7. “We Conservatives must never say anything we know to be false,” she said, openly lying through her teeth. It was all just a weird combination of the mad and the bland. Does she really believe that only Conservatives love their country? If so, she’s dimmer than we thought. She went on to criticise Sunak’s immigration plans. Immigration must be cut, whatever the economic costs. We could train up Brits to do the jobs they had shown no sign of wanting to do. Maybe she would like to take the lead. “It’s not racist to want to control borders,” she said. True. But that wasn’t going to stop some of the Nat Cons. And yes, she was happy to have banned any protests at the coronation. “Conservatism is not an ideology,” she concluded. It was the universal disposition of humanity. That’s if you believe that humanity’s destiny is to get lost in conspiracy theories and Little England memes. “The facts of life are conservative.” What is it with these oddballs? Everything always seems to come back to sex.</body>

    <head>Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 446 of the invasion</head>
    <body>Ukraine’s president visited the UK on Monday for talks with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak. In a tweet, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “The UK is a leader when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face to face and in delegations.” Sunak said the UK would be “sustaining our support” for Ukraine as he prepared to meet Zelenskiy. In a statement, the prime minister said: “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke. They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year. We must not let them down.” Britain would send hundreds of new long-range attack drones with a range of over 120 miles to Ukraine, the government said. “Today the prime minister will confirm the further UK provision of hundreds of air defence missiles and further unmanned aerial systems including hundreds of new long-range attack drones with a range of over 200km,” it said in a statement. Russia’s defence ministry claimed for the first time today that it had downed a long-range Storm Shadow missile supplied to Ukraine by Britain. Russia took an “extremely negative” view of Britain’s decision to supply Ukraine with more military hardware such as long-range attack drones, but did not believe it would change the course of the conflict, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday. The US is seeing more indications that Russia and Iran are expanding an unprecedented defence partnership that will help Moscow prolong its war in Ukraine as well as pose a threat to Iran’s neighbours. Iran reportedly provided Russia with one-way attack drones, including more than 400 since August, the US national security adviser, John Kirby, said at a news briefing. The World Health Organization’s European office decided to close a specialised WHO office in Moscow and move its functions to Denmark. Calls from members to shut the office came last year over the Russian invasion. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, inadvertently confirmed on Monday that four military aircraft had been shot down over Russia last week near the borders of Ukraine and Belarus, saying the capital city, Minsk, had responded by putting its armed forces on high alert. Photographs also emerged of Lukashenko on Monday visiting an air force installation. He had not been seen since 9 May, which caused speculation about his health. Data published on the Federal Treasury’s online budget portal shows Russia spent 2tn roubles (£21bn) on defence in January and February alone. This is a 282% jump on the same period a year ago, data on the budget portal showed, illustrating the spiralling costs for Moscow of its conflict in Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry said it scrambled a fighter jet on Monday to prevent French and German patrol aircraft from entering its airspace over the Baltic Sea after it detected them flying towards Russia. Russia said the flights were being conducted by a German P-3C patrol aircraft and a French Atlantic-2 maritime patrol jet. The UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said that efforts would continue to extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain, a pact Moscow has threatened to quit on 18 May over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports, Reuters reports. Zelenskiy issued a new appeal to Nato on Monday to make a “positive political decision” on Kyiv’s membership at its July summit. Zelenskiy made his remarks in a video address to the Copenhagen Democracy Summit. He said that Finland joining Nato showed the strength of security guarantees, and thanked Denmark and other allies for their resolve in assisting Ukraine against Russia. The defence of Bakhmut continued and recent days had shown that Ukraine could move forward and counter the Russian forces there, the commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Monday. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the self-acknowledged founder of the Russian mercenary Wagner group, tried to laugh off a report published in the Washington Post that claimed he had offered to reveal Russian military positions to Ukrainian intelligence if Kyiv pulled its troops back from Bakhmut. The EU is ready to enforce sanctions against foreign companies helping Russia evade trade restrictions, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated on Monday. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he expects the alliance to agree a “multi-year programme” to assist Ukraine in its desire to join, and that there was no “meaning in discussing when and how Ukraine can become a member of the alliance” unless it prevailed in the war “as a sovereign independent nation in Europe”. France at the weekend announced dozens more light tanks and armoured vehicles for Ukraine’s army, together with training for the soldiers using them, following talks between the Ukrainian and French presidents in Paris. Zelenskiy and Emmanuel Macron also called for fresh sanctions against Russia. The leaders’ joint statement also said Paris would focus its efforts on “supporting Ukraine’s air defence capacities”. The two leaders’ comments came after Zelenskiy flew into France late on Sunday during a whistle-stop tour of Europe and joined Macron for a dinner at the Élysée Palace. Zelenskiy tweeted earlier as he arrived in the country at an airbase in Villacoublay, south-west of Paris: “With each visit, Ukraine’s defense and offensive capabilities are expanding.” Zelenskiy thanked Germany for its support and what he called the largest military aid package since the beginning of Russia’s invasion as he met with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin on Sunday. The trip came after the German government announced a new military package worth €2.7bn as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia. During Zelenskiy’s visit to Germany, he was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne prize on behalf of the Ukrainian people in honour of services to Europe. The Ukrainian president received the award, which honours services to European unification, in the western city of Aachen with Scholz after their talks in Berlin. The German Football Association (DFB) vice-president, Hermann Winkler, on Monday apologised for a social media post mocking the visit to Berlin. Russia said two of its military commanders were killed in eastern Ukraine, as Ukraine’s forces renewed efforts to break through Russian defences in embattled Bakhmut. The Russian defence ministry said on Sunday that commander Vyacheslav Makarov, of the 4th motorised rifle brigade, and deputy commander Yevgeny Brovko, from a separate unit, were killed trying to repel Ukrainian attacks. Russia has “already lost geopolitically” its war in Ukraine and is transforming into a vassal state of China, Macron has said. “De facto, it has entered a form of subservience with regards to China and has lost its access to the Baltic, which was critical, because it prompted the decision by Sweden and Finland to join Nato,” the French president said in an interview with the Opinion newspaper published on Sunday. Russian forces were much diminished since the start of the war, the UK Ministry of Defence said, with troops consisting of mostly poorly trained mobilised reservists and increasingly reliant on antiquated equipment. Many of its units were severely under strength, it said.</body>

    <head>The Guardian view on Rishi Sunak’s woes: he’s clearing up a mess he made</head>
    <body>The length of time a party has been in power can equally make or break a premiership: it is far harder to make a mark coming to office at the end of a long period of dominance. Rishi Sunak is learning that lesson. Since last October he has been righting the listing Conservative ship. However, the losses his party suffered at the hands of opponents in May’s local elections have emboldened four distinct groups of critical voices within his party: former prime ministers; thwarted ex-ministers; the Tory right and ambitious frontbenchers jockeying to lead the party after Mr Sunak has gone. The prime minister looks as if he may be about to become as exercised by splits within his own party as by the challenge posed by the official opposition. The prime minister could dismiss as symbolic Theresa May’s sit-in protest at the base of the throne in the House of Lords last week over the government’s new asylum bill. He might brush off former home secretary Priti Patel’s claim that Boris Johnson would win the next election as sour grapes. But Downing Street will be more concerned that the Tory right is still smarting over the implosion of the Truss regime. Its collapse interrupted political careers that cannot be resumed unless Mr Sunak’s grip on power is loosened. A majority in parliament ought to mean Mr Sunak can take major decisions without taking the cabinet with him – relying instead on his own small inner circle in No 10. Yet it is the party in the country, one stuffed with councillors sullen from defeat, which looks like becoming a challenge to his authority. Party members look at the polls and want to see their passions being stirred for the fight ahead. The danger is that Mr Sunak seems to prefer book‑keeping to boosterism. His team have coalesced around the prime minister’s minimal programme, but with little enthusiasm. What seems to exercise ambitious cabinet ministers is not the thought of running the state but pleasing the Conservative party’s core voters. That is why the home secretary, Suella Braverman, says migration ought to be going down whatever the cost to the country or why the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, says that the tax burden is too high. Instead of coming clean with the electorate that 13 years of Tory government has produced the opposite of what was promised, cabinet ministers are making their excuses. Rishi Sunak is in power to clear up a mess that he helped create. Unfortunately for him realism does not play well in a party still gripped by Brexit fantasies. When the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, faced up to reality and told MPs she couldn’t abolish more than 4,000 EU laws – covering workers’ rights, environmental protection and food standards – by the end of the year as promised, the government’s actions were compared to the treachery of the medieval Borgias by her predecessor, Jacob Rees-Mogg. With time running out, the Conservative party looks like it has nowhere else to turn. Most voters are confronted daily by rising housing and food costs, falling real wages and the parlous condition of public services – particularly the NHS. They would like to hear less about “radical left” fairy tales from those who think Tory politics part of a rightwing entertainment business. Mr Sunak’s problem is that he personifies the policies that left the country in such dire straits, rather than a departure from them.</body>

    <head>The Guardian view on Turkey’s election results: a step towards autocracy?</head>
    <body>In the lead-up to Turkey’s presidential election on Sunday, there seemed to be good grounds to believe that voters were about to turn their back on Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s authoritarian brand of nationalism. His assumption of quasi-monarchical presidential powers in 2018 had succeeded in uniting a perennially divided opposition against him. Polls suggested a close race, but placed the president’s main rival for power, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, significantly ahead. Requiring a vote above 50% to win outright and avoid a runoff, Mr Kılıçdaroğlu’s declared aspiration was to “finish it in the first round”. That optimism has turned out to be sadly misplaced. As it transpired, it was Mr Erdoğan who almost won at the first time of asking, winning over 49% of votes to Mr Kılıçdaroğlu’s 45%. The coalition led by the president’s Justice and Development party (AKP) is also set to win a surprise majority in the Grand National Assembly. That outcome will stymie opposition attempts to restore parliamentary democracy to Turkey, irrespective of the result of the presidential runoff in a fortnight’s time. Mr Kılıçdaroğlu’s race is not yet run. But a combination of incumbency advantage, and the momentum provided by the AKP’s win in parliament, means that Mr Erdoğan is now likely to extend his increasingly autocratic rule into a third decade. This despite an inflation rate running close to 50% as a result of his refusal to raise interest rates, and widespread disillusionment at the government’s sluggish response to the devastating earthquakes three months ago. For Europe and the US, which had hoped an opposition victory would see Turkey turn more towards the west, five more years of Mr Erdoğan would be a highly unwelcome development – particularly ahead of a decisive period in Ukraine. For those likely to suffer further erosion of their civil rights in Mr Erdoğan’s increasingly illiberal democracy, Sunday’s setback is a bitter disappointment and an ominous portent. Turkey’s Kurdish minority population, dissidents, journalists, women’s rights campaigners and LGBTQ+ people have all been subject to political repression in recent years, as the president has shored up his popularity through culture wars and a focus on terrorism and security. If Mr Erdoğan survives this, the most concerted and unified democratic challenge to his power to date, the temptation to move Turkey further down the road towards full-blown autocracy will be considerable. Mr Kılıçdaroğlu’s deflated alliance has two weeks to shift the dial in a presidential race that has confounded its expectations. In the context of a hostile media overwhelmingly biased in favour of Mr Erdoğan, that will be a very tall order. If the opposition is to succeed, it will need to make inroads among less well-off nationalist voters outside the cities, who appear to have responded to pre-election measures to mitigate the crisis caused by soaring inflation. Last week, Mr Erdoğan announced a 45% pay hike for public sector workers, the latest in a series of moves including a reduction in electricity prices, and the offer of a month’s free natural gas to households. Notwithstanding the economic pain caused by out-of-control inflation, Mr Erdoğan persuaded the religious conservative working class that he remains the best leader to protect their interests. Unless Mr Kılıçdaroğlu can convince enough of them otherwise, the medium-term prospects for Turkish democracy look bleak.</body>

    <head>Briton tells Cyprus court wife begged him to end her cancer pain</head>
    <body>A euthanasia case that has gripped Cyprus for more than a year has entered its final phase as a British pensioner accused of murdering his cancer-stricken wife told how she “begged” him to end the excruciating pain that made her life unbearable. David Hunter had waited a long time to have his day in court and in electrifying evidence before a three-member tribunal in Paphos on Monday, the 76-year-old described the circumstances that he said led him in the run-up to Christmas 2021 to fatally smother his wife, Janice, his teenage sweetheart and the woman he had loved for more than half a century. He said the decision had been harrowing, he had hoped there would be good news that would stop her pleading with him to take her life, but once the deed was done, Janice was finally at peace. “For six weeks, every day, she begged me,” the former miner told the district court in Paphos, a resort town in the island’s south-west that is popular with British expats. Janice and David Hunter on their wedding day. Photograph: Family handout/PA “I would never have helped her end her life if she hadn’t begged me,” he said, his voice cracking as he recalled the moment he took her head in his hands and blocked her mouth and nose, pressing hard until, drained of oxygen, her face turned grey. “I didn’t want to. I had lived with her for 57 years. She wasn’t just my wife. She was my best friend,” he said. The Briton, who stands accused of premeditated murder in a place where euthanasia is vehemently opposed by the Orthodox church, told the court of his struggle to persuade the 74-year-old “to give it time” in the hope she would stop pleading with him to end a life destroyed by the devastating effects of leukaemia. “I had no interest in killing her,” said the grandfather, who has spent almost 18 months sharing a cell with 12 other men in an overcrowded prison in Nicosia, the capital. “I hoped that something would happen, something good.” But in the six weeks prior to her death, Hunter said, his wife became progressively more desperate. For more than three years, he said, the side-effects of injections and then blood transfusions had kept her confined to the couple’s rented maisonette in Tremithousa, a village in the hills above Paphos. She was forced by incessant diarrhoea to wear nappies, an indignity of which she was especially ashamed, he said. With the pandemic exacerbating problems with access to doctors and medicines, days were often punctuated by visits to the hospital where Janice had also undergone laser surgery to remove cancer on her face and had interventions on her knees, foot and collarbone. In the days before her death, the couple slept on leather easy chairs in their sitting room because Janice was too weak to move or walk. “She was sick of all the treatment, she was sick of life … she was full of pain,” said Hunter as he sobbed and wiped tears from his face. “I don’t remember a lot of the last day. I went to make a cup of coffee and she started crying. The next thing I knew I put my hands on her … when it was finished, she was a grey colour. She didn’t look like my wife, and it was the first time I cried in many years.” Hunter, who tried to kill himself soon after, has never denied his role in his wife’s death. When police rushed to the villa, alerted by his brother William, who himself had been informed about the incident by David, the Briton was quick to confess, telling a police officer he had “killed Janice to save her”. But the lack of a written note or any other evidence has been pivotal in the court deciding that Hunter may have acted on his own accord, with judges rejecting a defence plea to reduce the charge from premeditated murder to manslaughter. Hunter acknowledged he should have made clear he had “helped” Janice end her life, in what in other EU member states would be considered assisted suicide. Bristling at the suggestion that his wife had put up resistance, he said her head remained still throughout the 15 minutes it took to end her life – the time needed to ensure she did not suffer brain death and fall into a vegetative state. During a dramatic day of proceedings, tensions rose as the state prosecutor Andreas Hadjikyrou contended that Hunter had taken the decision to end his wife’s life in a way that was unduly painful and cruel. “I put it to you that you had decided to kill your wife, that there was no consent between you, that you had decided how to do it but had not decided when to do it,” said the prosecutor, telling the court that it was vital no precedent was set. As the fiery exchange unfolded, the mild-mannered Briton angrily responded: “The last thing I wanted was to take her life. That is his idea not mine. She was lying there in pain and there was nothing I could do about it.” The couple, originally from Ashington in Northumberland, had retired to Cyprus, leaving their only child, Lesley, in the UK. After 41 years working in the Northumberland mines, David Hunter had hoped it would be the start of a dream life abroad. The case has become a cause célèbre in Cyprus, with euthanasia campaigners hoping it will help change “outdated” views over the right to die. Speaking outside the courthouse, the British barrister Michael Polak, who heads Justice Abroad, a legal aid group that helps UK citizens overseas, said Hunter had looked forward to “having the opportunity to tell his side of the story”. “This has been a very long trial and David was pleased to tell people what had happened and why,” he said. “It is always hard for a person of his age to give testimony but he made clear there was no motivation, that he was continuously asked to end her life, which he did not want to do, and that he was in a long and loving relationship with his wife.” The trial continues, with defence witnesses taking the stand next week before closing submissions are made and a verdict reached.

    <head>Lucy Letby said hospital staffing was ‘completely unsafe’, murder trial told</head>
    <body>Lucy Letby believed staffing levels on a hospital’s neonatal unit were completely unsafe during what was an “increasingly busy” period, her murder trial has heard. A lot of staff on the unit at the Countess of Chester hospital were drained “physically and emotionally”, Letby said on Monday, her third day of giving evidence at Manchester crown court. Letby, 33, denies murdering seven babies and attempting to kill 10 others between June 2015 and June 2016. Her barrister Ben Myers KC asked Letby about a message she sent to colleagues on 24 September in which she said the unit was “completely unsafe”. Myers asked: “What was that referring to?” Letby replied: “The staffing that was on the unit. We had got 18 babies, which is over capacity. We had capacity for 16. There was a lot going on.” Myers then asked: “Had the unit been as busy as this in all the years you worked there?” Letby said: “No. It was increasingly busy at this period. A lot of staff were drained physically and emotionally. The unit was very busy, lots of people were doing additional shifts and changing shifts at the last minute and it did start to have an effect on everybody.” Myers asked Letby questions about Child G, an extremely premature-born girl, who she is alleged to have attempted to murder on three separate occasions. At one point Letby said she caught sight of Child G on her own, blue in colour and not breathing. Myers asked: “What did you do when you found her in that position?” Letby said: “At this point [Child G] was on the procedure trolley, which is a flat bed with no sides, and I put her into the cot and immediately started Neopuffing [breathing support].” Myers said: “Should she have been left on the procedure trolley?” Letby said: “No, that’s not the style of practice at all. I was very concerned about it. “Three issues really: we would never leave a baby unattended on a procedure trolley, unattended behind a screen or without a monitor on. And those three things had happened.” Earlier Letby described how she photographed a thank you card from the parents of two of her alleged victims, the newborn twin boys known as Child E and Child F. Jurors have heard that the parents brought in a hamper and a thank you card to the unit about three months after the deaths. Letby said there was nothing unusual in her taking a photograph. “It was something I wanted to remember. I quite often take photographs of cards I have sent and received,” she added. The trial continues.</body>

    <head>Chelsea keen on Napoli’s Victor Osimhen for rebuild under Pochettino</head>
    <body>Chelsea are lining up an ambitious move for Napoli’s Victor Osimhen, with Mauricio Pochettino keen to bring in a striker when he takes over as head coach this summer. Pochettino is flying to London this week to sign a three-year deal and will have funds to strengthen his squad. Chelsea want a goalkeeper, additions in central midfield and a potent No 9. They have toiled in the final third this season and have not had a clinical striker since selling Diego Costa in 2017. Chelsea, who are fighting a losing battle to keep Mason Mount, have had Osimhen on their radar for a while. The Nigeria striker has been crucial to Napoli romping to the Serie A title this season, scoring 23 goals in 29 league games. Osimhen has done well against Chelsea in the past, scoring against them in the Champions League for Lille in 2019.

In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications. Turn on sport notifications. However it will not be easy to get the 24-year-old out of Napoli, who are likely to demand a huge fee. Napoli will want to make a strong title defence and hope to challenge in the Champions League after reaching the quarter-finals this season. Chelsea need to sell themselves to potential targets given that they will not be playing in Europe. They will face competition from Bayern Munich for Osimhen. Manchester United are interested but their top priority remains Tottenham’s Harry Kane. There could be concerns over whether Osimhen will adapt to English football. Chelsea will also need to work out what to do with Romelu Lukaku when the striker returns from his loan at Internazionale. It is unclear whether Lukaku, who will be handed a chance by Pochettino, will be loaned back to Inter. Chelsea will also need to move Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang. Chelsea have several attacking midfielders and wide players but lack a focal point. Others on their shortlist include Inter’s Lautaro Martínez and Brentford’s Ivan Toney. However Toney could be hit with a lengthy ban by the Football Association after accepting multiple charges of breaching its betting rules. In the search for a goalkeeper Chelsea regard Aston Villa’s Emi Martínez, Brentford’s David Raya and Inter’s André Onana as possible replacements for Édouard Mendy and Kepa Arrizabalaga. The Brighton midfielders Alexis Mac Allister and Moisés Caicedo were targeted by Chelsea in January. Arsenal and United are leading the race to sign West Ham’s Declan Rice. Chelsea’s incomings are likely to be relatively restrained, with a bigger focus on players leaving. The club have a bloated squad after spending wildly in the previous two transfer windows and are under pressure to raise funds because of concerns over financial fair play rules. There is a growing expectation that Mount, one of the best players to emerge from Chelsea’s academy, will depart because of uncertainty over his contract. The midfielder’s deal expires next year and there is still no sign he will agree an extension. Liverpool are favourites to sign Mount, who is also wanted by United. There has been speculation that Pochettino could convince the England international to stay but Chelsea are not optimistic of keeping the 24-year-old. Mateo Kovacic, whose deal expires next year, is in a similar position to Mount. The Croatia midfielder is wanted by Manchester City, Manchester United and Bayern.</body>

    <head>Piers Morgan knew his journalists were using voicemails for stories, court told</head>
    <body>Piers Morgan knew his journalists were using private voicemails as the basis of their stories, the royal biographer Omid Scobie has told Prince Harry’s phone-hacking trial. Scobie, who co-wrote a sympathetic book about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, told the high court he was doing work experience at the Daily Mirror in 2002 when he overheard Morgan discussing the source of a story about Kylie Minogue with a reporter. He said in a witness statement: “Mr Morgan was asking how confident they were in the reporting and was told that the information had come from voicemails. I recall being surprised to hear this at the time, which is why it stuck in my mind.” Scobie told the high court that Morgan “seemed reassured” after being informed that the story about Minogue’s private life came from voicemails. The journalist said Morgan was “extremely hands-on” and would want to know how his reporters had obtained information. “That’s any editor’s question: what’s the sourcing? Who is the source?” he said. Prince Harry and the other alleged victims claim Morgan and other Mirror executives authorised illegal behaviour to obtain exclusive stories, such as accessing celebrities’ voicemails, paying private investigators and “blagging” personal financial records. Morgan, now the lead presenter on Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTV, has always insisted there is no evidence he knowingly commissioned stories based on illegal voicemail interception while editing the Daily Mirror between 1995 and 2004. Mirror Group Newspapers is disputing much of the evidence in this trial and argues that Harry and the other claimants have waited too long to bring their cases. Andrew Green KC, the Mirror’s barrister, suggested Scobie had invented the incident involving Morgan and it was a “false memory”. The lawyer accused Scobie of having a “vested interest” in helping Harry because the journalist’s career had benefited from his closeness to the royal couple. The court heard that the Sussexes had “expressly authorised” their former spokesperson Jason Knauf to brief Scobie when he wrote his book Finding Freedom. Scobie said all his contact with the royal couple was through their spokesperson. “There was no communication between myself and the Sussexes … Jason sat down and went through a number of points while we were factchecking the book.” He told the court that he simply wanted to be “fair” to the couple in his writing, unlike other royal correspondents. He said: “I’m constantly called the couple’s friend, mouthpiece, cheerleader. What I’m doing here today is making my life more difficult.” The journalist said he had never socialised with Harry, and he expected to be heavily criticised by tabloid newspapers for giving evidence in this trial. Scobie said he was tired of being described by the Daily Mail and other outlets as a “pal” of the couple. Prince Harry is one of four alleged phone-hacking victims whose claims are being tested in a continuing civil trial at the high court. The prince and the other alleged victims claim they were illegally targeted by journalists working for Mirror Group Newspapers – the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, and People tabloids – with the knowledge of senior executives. Phone hacking involved calling an individual’s phone number and attempting to guess the pin code that provided remote access to voicemails. Thousands of victims were hacked by journalists working for Mirror Group Newspapers and Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers, leading to decades of legal proceedings that have cost hundreds of millions of pounds. In addition to this case, Prince Harry is bringing separate phone-hacking claims against the publisher of the Sun and the publisher of the Daily Mail. In his evidence, Scobie said he believed Morgan’s discussion of voicemails about Kylie Minogue related to an article by the Daily Mirror showbiz journalist James Scott that was published a few days later under the headline “Can’t get you out of my bed”. The article quoted “friends” of Minogue talking about the state of her relationship and had specific details of recent discussions between the singer and her estranged boyfriend. Scobie claims he has since seen evidence that a private investigator involved in phone hacking sent an invoice to the Mirror headlined “K Minogue” charging £170 for “extensive inquiries carried out on your behalf”. The royal reporter said he was not shocked to hear Morgan discussing the use of voicemails because he had already encountered phone hacking while doing work experience at the People, the Mirror’s sister newspaper. He told the court: “I recall being given by a journalist a list of mobile numbers followed by a detailed verbal description of how to listen to voicemails, as if it were a routine news-gathering technique. I was taken aback by what seemed completely immoral and I never carried out the task.” Andrew Green KC, the Mirror’s barrister, said it was improbable that Scobie would have been asked to illegally hack phones while on work experience. Scobie replied: “You would be surprised at what happened during internships.” The court previously heard evidence from the former Sunday Mirror journalist Dan Evans, who told the court that illegal activity was “bog-standard” at the tabloid newspaper and that he was taught how to hack phones by its former editor Tina Weaver. “The paper did dodgy stuff on basically every story and that is how we operated,” he said.</body>

    <head>UK will train Ukraine pilots, Sunak tells Zelenskiy; Russia and Iran appear to be expanding cooperation, US says – as it happened</head>
    <body>6.55pm BST Evening summary It is almost 9pm in Kyiv. Here is a round-up of some of the day’s main stories: Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited Chequers in Buckinghamshire for talks with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak on Monday. Sunak said Britain would provide Ukraine with hundreds of air defence missiles and further unmanned aerial systems, including new long-range attack drones with a range of more than 200km, to be delivered over the coming months. Zelenskiy’s visit comes off the back of trips to Berlin and Paris, and with the UK last week having pledged to send longer ranger cruise missiles to support Ukraine’s efforts to oust Russian forces from its territory. The United States is seeing more indications that Russia and Iran are expanding an unprecedented defence partnership that will help Moscow prolong its war in Ukraine as well as pose a threat to Iran’s neighbours. Iran reportedly provided Russia with one-way attack drones, including more than 400 since august, US national security adviser John Kirby said at a news briefing. The World Health Organization’s European office decided to close a specialised WHO office in Moscow and move its functions to Denmark. Calls from members to shut the office came last year over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, inadvertently confirmed on Monday that four military aircraft had been shot down over Russia last week near the borders of Ukraine and Belarus, saying the capital city Minsk had responded by putting its armed forces on high alert. Photos also emerged of Lukashenko today visiting an air force installation, who had not been seen since 9 May, which caused speculation about his health. Data published on the Federal Treasury’s online budget portal Russia spent 2tn roubles (£21bn) on defence in January and February alone. This is a 282% jump on the same period a year ago, data on the budget portal showed, illustrating the spiralling costs for Moscow of its conflict in Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry said it scrambled a fighter jet today to prevent French and German patrol aircraft from entering its airspace over the Baltic Sea after it detected them flying towards Russia. Russia said the flights were being conducted by a German P-3C patrol aircraft and a French Atlantic-2 maritime patrol jet. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed for the first time today that it had downed a long-range Storm Shadow missile supplied to Ukraine by Britain, which announced last week that it was providing them. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Monday that Russia viewed Britain’s decision to supply the missiles “extremely negatively”. UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said today that efforts will continue to extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain, a pact Moscow has threatened to quit on 18 May over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports, Reuters reports. Ahead of the trip Zelenskiy’s trip to the UK on Monday, he tweeted: “The UK is a leader when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face-to-face and in delegations.” Sunak said in a statement: “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke. They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year. We must not let them down.” Zelenskiy issued a new appeal to Nato on Monday to make a “positive political decision” on Kyiv’s membership at its July summit. Zelenskiy made his remarks in a video address to the Copenhagen democracy summit. He said that Finland joining Nato showed the strength of security guarantees, and thanked Denmark and other allies for their resolve in assisting Ukraine against Russia. The defence of Bakhmut continues and recent days have shown that Ukraine can move forward and counter the Russian forces there, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Monday. Updated at 7.38pm BST 6.24pm BST Photos and videos emerged showing Alexander Lukashenko visiting an air force installation in Belarus today, AP reports. The 68-year-old was last seen on 9 May and there had been speculation about his health. He is a close ally of Russian president, Vladimir Putin, allowing the Kremlin to use his country as a staging ground for its war in neighboring Ukraine, although he has stopped short of committing his troops to the conflict Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, speaks to officers as he visits the Central Command Post of the air force and air defence forces in Belarus, Monday 15 May 2023.

As part of the cooperation, Iran is providing Russia with one-way attack drones, including more than 400 since August, US national security adviser John Kirby said at a news briefing. Updated at 7.29pm BST 5.41pm BST The World Health Organization’s European office decided to close a specialised WHO office in Moscow and move its functions to Denmark, AFP reports. The move, which was decided during a virtual session held today, follows calls from members last year to shut the office over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The session was also convened after a group of 30 member states requested a special session in a letter in April, which noted that the “immediate and long-term health impacts in Ukraine and beyond” caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “continue to be a matter of utmost concern”. A majority of the 53 European region member states agreed to the decision, which means the closure of the health body’s “Office for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases,” in Moscow, with its functions to be relocated to the regional office in Denmark “no later than” 1 January 2024. The matter does however not concern the WHO’s country office for Russia. Updated at 5.54pm BST 5.35pm BST Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, inadvertently confirmed on Monday that four military aircraft had been shot down over Russia last week near the borders of Ukraine and Belarus, saying the capital city Minsk had responded by putting its armed forces on high alert, Reuters reports. The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported on Saturday that a Russian raiding party comprising an Su-34 fighter-bomber, an Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had been shot down in an ambush near Klintsy in Russia’s Bryansk region. It said they had been due to attack targets in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine, directly over the border. The Russian state news agency Tass said on Saturday that a Russian Su-34 warplane had crashed, but did not specify a cause, and cited emergency services as saying an engine fire had brought down a helicopter. It did not mention the Su-35 or a second helicopter, although several heavily followed Russian pro-war military bloggers also said the four aircraft had been shot down. The Pul Pervovo Telegram channel, a Belarusian state outlet that reports on Lukashenko’s activities, said on Monday that he had visited an air force command base, and quoted him as saying: Three days after the events near us – I mean in the Bryansk region, when four aircraft were shot down. We are forced to respond. Since then, we, our troops, have been on high alert. Lukashenko’s reported visit to the base was his first public appearance in almost a week, after speculation over the health of the 68-year-old leader. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the Kommersant report. There was also no official response to the incident from Ukraine. Updated at 7.29pm BST 5.05pm BST Russia spent 2tn roubles (£21bn) on defence in January and February alone, a 282% jump on the same period a year ago, data on the budget portal showed, illustrating the spiralling costs for Moscow of its conflict in Ukraine, Reuters reports. The data, published on the Federal Treasury’s online budget portal, gives specific insight into military expenditure. According to the data, defence spending amounted to 1.18tn roubles in January and 822.4bn roubles in February. Data published last week showed that Russia’s budget deficit stood at 3.4tn roubles for January to April, compared with a 1.2tn-rouble surplus in 2022, as Moscow has spent heavily and energy revenues have dropped. The data shows Russia spent just over 40% of its planned annual allocation for the defence sector in January-February. Last year, Russia spent 5.51tn roubles, or 17.1% of its total expenditure on defence, up from 3.57tn roubles, or 14.4%, in 2021. In January-February 2023, national defence spending was 36.2% of the total budget expenditure, nearly double the amount spent on social policy and almost four times more than spending on the “national economy”. Updated at 5.09pm BST 4.34pm BST Russia claims it scrambled jet to stop French and German patrol flights entering airspace Russia’s defence ministry said it scrambled a fighter jet today to prevent French and German patrol aircraft from entering its airspace over the Baltic Sea after it detected them flying towards Russia, Reuters reports. Russia said the flights were being conducted by a German P-3C patrol aircraft and a French Atlantic-2 maritime patrol jet. After the Russian jet was scrambled and the French and German ones turned away from Russia, the Su-27 returned to base, the defence ministry said. In a statement, the defence ministry said: Two air targets were detected approaching Russia’s state border. In order to identify the targets and prevent the Russian state border being violated, an Su-27 fighter from the Baltic Fleet air force was scrambled. 4.12pm BST Russia’s defence ministry said today it had scrambled fighter jets to prevent French and German patrol aircraft from entering its airspace over the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports.

We will continue to call on all to meet their responsibilities as the world watches us very closely.

Updated at 2.49pm BST 2.39pm BST There are conflicting and unverified reports that the Russian-installed minister of the interior for the occupying authorities in Luhansk has been injured in an explosion. Tass is reporting that law enforcement agencies of the region have told it that Igor Kornet was among five people reported injured when a grenade exploded in a hairdressing salon in central Luhansk. The Telegram channel used by Leonid Pasechnik, the Russian-imposed leader in occupied Luhansk, has reported “seven people were injured. All the wounded were hospitalised in medical institutions of the republic. Four men are in serious condition, including a 17-year-old, as well as acting minister of internal affairs Igor Kornet. Doctors are fighting for the lives of the victims.”. None of the claims have been independently verified. The RIA Novosti agency has carried some video footage of what appears to be the aftermath of an explosion, and the Guardian has seen still images which purport to show wounded people at the location, but it remains unclear what happened. More details soon … Updated at 2.41pm BST 2.08pm BST Here is the video clip of Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Rishi Sunak together earlier. 2.01pm BST The German Football Association (DFB) vice- president, Hermann Winkler, on Monday apologised for a social media post mocking the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to Berlin at the weekend. Reuters reports Winkler had complained about road closures and other security restrictions, saying “at least the Soviet Memorial in Treptower Park is still standing for now”. He said the city had shut down for the visit “of a former Ukrainian actor.” Winkler, who has since deleted his post, apologised and said he also had a discussion with the DFB leadership on the matter. Germany will host the Euro 2024 competition.

Photograph: Reuters 1.16pm BST Russia claims it shot down a British Storm Shadow missile in Ukraine Russia’s defence ministry has claimed for the first time today that it had downed a long-range Storm Shadow missile supplied to Ukraine by Britain, which announced last week that it was providing them, Reuters reports. The ministry said in its daily briefing on the Ukraine conflict that it had shot down the cruise missile, as well as shorter-range US-built Himars-launcher and HARM missiles. The claims have not been independently verified. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Monday that Russia viewed Britain’s decision to supply the missiles “extremely negatively”. Ukraine says it has already used the longer range missiles to strike at targets deeper within Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. Updated at 1.44pm BST 1.10pm BST Britain says it will send long-range drones and train pilots as Zelenskiy visits Sunak in UK Here is a recap of events earlier today, when Ukraine’s president made an unannounced visit to the UK: Britain promised the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, long-range attack drones when he visited the country today as part of a European tour aimed at securing new weapons for a counteroffensive against Russia. Zelenskiy met prime minister Rishi Sunak at the British leader’s Chequers country residence, where the pair also discussed Ukraine’s request for western fighter jets. Britain said it would begin basic training of Ukrainian pilots this summer “hand in hand with UK efforts to work with other countries on providing F-16 jets”. Sunak said Britain would provide Ukraine with hundreds of air defence missiles and further unmanned aerial systems, including new long-range attack drones with a range of more than 200km, to be delivered over the coming months. It remains unclear exactly what type of drones the announcement referred to. Sunak’s spokesperson confirmed again that Britain had no plans to send fighter jets directly to Ukraine. The Ukrainians made the decision to train their pilots on F-16s and you will know the RAF don’t use those,” he said. In response, the Kremlin said Russia takes an “extremely negative” view of Britain’s decision to supply Ukraine with more military hardware but does not believe London’s help will change the course of the conflict. Sunak said: The conflict is at a pivotal moment. The UK will remain steadfast in supporting Ukraine and its people to defend itself … it is important for the Kremlin to also know that we are not going away. We are here for the long term. Updated at 2.10pm BST 12.57pm BST Prigozhin tries to laugh off reports he was in contact with Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, reports: Yevgeny Prigozhin, the self-acknowledged founder of the Russian paramilitary army Wagner, has tried to laugh off a report published in the Washington Post that claimed he had offered to reveal Russian military positions to Ukrainian intelligence if Kyiv pulled its troops back from the battlefield city of Bakhmut. Yet the rate and tone of his denials as of Monday afternoon could indicate that the Russian warlord is getting nervous about being regarded as a traitor. The explosive report was based on information from the Discord leaks and was corroborated by intelligence sources, the Washington Post said. [See 6.10 BST] “They could have put more effort into it and [falsified] some telephone screenshots,” Prigozhin said on Monday of the reporting, which suggested he had held direct meetings with officers from Ukraine’s military intelligence (HUR) in Africa. In another statement, he claimed he hadn’t been in Africa since before the beginning of the conflict and blamed his enemies for “pouring shit on me”, suggesting it could be “people from Rublyovka”, an expensive area just outside Moscow, meaning his enemies could be in the Russian establishment. For Prigozhin, it would be an obvious act of treason to suggest revealing Russian military positions. The bloodthirsty businessman with ties to Vladimir Putin has grown more erratic in recent weeks, as he has engaged in a growing conflict with the Russian military and defence minister Sergei Shoigu, whom he has accused of depriving his men of artillery shells. But directly collaborating with the enemy would be a big escalation on Prigozhin’s part and one that he would know would leave him vulnerable to his enemies inside Russia and abroad. He also has a long track record in Russia of trolling and toying with his enemies, helping found bot farms, fake newspapers and the now-notorious paramilitary group that he is said to bankroll. Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the R.Politik analysis firm, wrote that she “did not believe” that Prigozhin was an open traitor. She, like other analysts, suggested that even if contacts with Ukrainian military intelligence were confirmed, that would not directly imply that he was betraying the Kremlin. First, Prigozhin’s “‘Betrayal’ could be a special task – to lead a counteroffensive into a trap”, she wrote on Monday. “2. Betrayal would be very beneficial to Prigozhin’s enemies inside and outside Russia.” Updated at 1.19pm BST 12.50pm BST Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels The EU is ready to enforce sanctions against foreign companies helping Russia evade trade restrictions, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has reiterated. The EU’s 27 member states are discussing plans to blacklist several Chinese companies for their role in supplying Russia with goods banned under western sanctions. The proposal is part of a wider set of measures to clamp down on countries in the Caucasus, Central Asia and Middle East believed to be helping Russia dodge western sanctions. Some EU member states, led by Germany, the EU’s export powerhouse, fear that targeting China and other non-EU countries could drive them closer into an alliance with Russia. Asked about this at a press conference, Von der Leyen did not respond directly, or name specific countries, but doubled down on the commission’s approach. She said: [The EU proposal was] basically a warning that we’re serious about our sanctions, that we could ban these goods from going to a third country, if there is clear evidence that this is a circumvention of time of sanctions and [there are] deliveries to Russia”. Von der Leyen, with EU council president Charles Michel, will represent the EU at an upcoming Council of Europe summit in Reykjavik and a G7 gathering in Hiroshima. Ahead of these events, she said countries had a duty to show “the same level of stamina, perseverance” that she had witnessed from Ukrainians on a visit to Kyiv last week. Leaders should rally behind two main principles, Von der Leyen said: One is that we will keep supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes and the second principle is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. As long as it takes must translate basically into stable financial support, of course also beyond 2023, and accelerated military support focused on the now and here. And nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine means very strong support for President Zelenskiy’s peace formula. Updated at 1.24pm BST 12.34pm BST Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Monday lauded “important and powerful” military aid from Britain, France and Germany, and said he was pleased with agreements reached during a tour of Europe, Reuters reports. Zelenskiy said: The priority [during our talks] was our counteroffensive actions, I am very pleased with the achievements and agreements. Updated at 12.36pm BST 12.24pm BST Stoltenberg: no point discussing how Ukraine can join Nato if it does not prevail in war first Nato’s secretary general has said he expects the alliance to agree a “multi-year programme” to assist Ukraine in its desire to join the organisation, and that there was no “meaning in discussing when and how Ukraine can become a member of the alliance” unless it prevails in the war “as a sovereign independent nation in Europe”. At the Copenhagen democracy summit, Jens Stoltenberg was being interviewed by one of his predecessor at the helm of Nato, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. He said Nato allies will, when they meet in July, the heads of state and government, they will send a very clear message of support to Ukraine, and this will be manifested in many different ways. When it comes to membership. I expect that Nato allies will say that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance. This has been stated several times. Ukraine has the right to choose his own path. It is not for Moscow to decide what Ukraine can do, it is for Ukraine. And it is for Nato allies to decide on the issue of membership … and of course those the Nato’s door remains open. I also expect that we will agree a multi-year programme for Ukraine where we will work on how to help Ukraine transition from Soviet-era standards, doctrines and equipment to Nato standard doctrines and equipment, and to become fully interoperable with Nato. And of course, to do that also helps them to move towards Nato membership. I also strongly believe that all allies will state that of course, the most urgent task now, is to ensure that Ukraine prevails. That President Putin do not does not win this war. Because it is only if Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation in Europe, that there is any meaning in discussing when and how Ukraine can become a member of the alliance. 12.20pm BST Britain has no plans to send fighter jets to Ukraine after the Ukrainian military indicated it would prefer to use F-16 fighter jets, the UK’s prime minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said on Monday, Reuters reports. Asked if Britain would send fighter jets to Ukraine, the spokesperson said: There are no plans to do that. The Ukrainians made the decision to train their pilots on F-16s and you will know the RAF don’t use those. 12.12pm BST On Twitter, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, Andriy Yermak, said he is with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the UK, working on “strengthening defence support”. In a tweet, he said: Today in 🇬🇧 together with the president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Our team is working on strengthening defence support and Euro-Atlantic integration. And we understand that we don’t have time for certain issues to “ride” – they must “fly”. Сьогодні у 🇬🇧 разом з Президентом @ZelenskyyUa. Наша команда працює над зміцненням оборонної підтримки та євроатлантичною інтеграцією.

Speaking after his talk with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at Chequers, Sunak said: We are going to be a key part of the coalition of countries that provides that support to Volodymyr and Ukraine. It is not a straightforward thing as Volodymyr and I have been discussing to build up that fighter combat aircraft capability. It’s not just the provision of planes, it is also the training of pilots and all the logistics that go alongside that, and the UK can play a big part in that. One thing we will be doing starting actually relatively soon is training of Ukrainian pilots and that’s something we’ve discussed today and we’re ready to implement those plans in relatively short order. Updated at 12.08pm BST 11.58am BST Russia takes an “extremely negative” view of Britain’s decision to supply Ukraine with more military hardware such as long-range attack drones, but does not believe it will change the course of the conflict, Reuters reports. Asked about Britain’s military aid, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: We take an extremely negative view of this. Britain is trying to be one of the leading countries which keeps pumping weapons into Ukraine. It cannot have any significant or major impact on the course of the special military operation But it all leads to more destruction, to further military action and so on. So for Ukraine, it makes things much more complex. “Special military operation” is Russia’s preferred term for its invasion of Ukraine. Updated at 2.14pm BST 11.55am BST Earlier, Rishi Sunak noted that today’s meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the prime minister’s country estate of Chequers was taking place in the buildup to a Council of Europe leaders’ meeting in Iceland and a G7 summit in Japan later this week. “The frontlines of Putin’s war of aggression may be in Ukraine but the fault lines stretch all over the world,” Sunak said. Zelenskiy told broadcasters after the meeting that the supply of jets was crucial to Ukraine. “Today we spoke about the jets. Very important topic for us because we can’t control the sky,” he said, adding that Ukraine and the UK were “real partners,” with Sunak being informed of details of developments on the battlefield.

Photograph: Reuters 11.50am BST UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said he discussed “long-term” security arrangements from allied countries for Ukraine to protect itself against “future Russian aggression” in his meeting with the country’s leader, PA reports. Speaking to broadcasters after his talk with Volodymyr Zelenskiy at Chequers, the prime minister said: Another topic of conversation we’ve had today is about the security arrangements we should put in place among allied countries for Ukraine for the long term to ensure it can defend itself and provide effective deterrence against future Russian aggression. Updated at 12.07pm BST 11.42am BST Zelenskiy discussed &apos;coalition of jets&apos; with Sunak on UK visit Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that he discussed “a coalition of jets” in discussions with the British prime minister at Chequers today. “I see that in the closest time, you will hear some, I think, very important decisions but we have to work a little bit more on it,” he said after a meeting with Sunak. Earlier the UK government said “This summer we will commence an elementary flying phase for cohorts of Ukrainian pilots to learn basic training. This will adapt the programme used by UK pilots to provide Ukrainians with piloting skills they can apply a different kind of aircraft. This training goes hand in hand with UK efforts to work with other countries on providing F16 jets – Ukraine’s fighter jets of choice.” However, so far London has been reluctant to directly supply modern jet fighters, arguing that it is logistically difficult to put them into operation in Ukraine. The UK has issued another picture of Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Rishi Sunak together at Chequers earlier today.

Updated at 11.45am BST 11.24am BST Ukraine cannot rule out that a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain will end on 18 May, when it is due to expire, and no additional talks are planned this week, a foreign ministry official said on Monday, Reuters reports. Olha Trofimtseva, a foreign ministry ambassador at large, told a briefing that Ukraine was receiving conflicting signals about the future of the deal, the extension of which was discussed at talks in Turkey last week. She said: The situation overall (after talks) has not changed much, and we receive quite conflicting information about the grain deal and the possibility of its continuation. Moscow has threatened to quit the agreement on 18 May unless a list of demands is met to remove obstacles to Russia’s own grain and fertiliser exports. These include lifting western sanctions on the Russian Agricultural bank. Trofimtseva added: Such a termination, [Russia’s] exit from the grain initiative is possible, but for everyone and primarily for the Russian side that will mean an escalation of the situation and they will complicate their future negotiation position for themselves.” She said Ukraine had exported 2.5m tonnes of agricultural goods in April despite a slowdown in the use of the grain corridor, caused by halts in the inspection regime which Ukraine has blamed on Moscow. 11.13am BST Sunak compares Zelenskiy&apos;s wartime leadership to Churchill during Chequers welcome Rishi Sunak has compared Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s wartime leadership to that of Winston Churchill. Welcoming the Ukrainian leader to Chequers, Sunak said: “You are actually the first foreign leader I have had the privilege of welcoming here as prime minister, and there’s a lot of great history here. “In fact this room that we are standing in, Winston Churchill made many of his famous speeches in the second world war from this room. And the same way today, your leadership, your country’s bravery and fortitude are an inspiration to us all. I look forward to us discussing what more we can do to support you and your country.” PA report Zelenskiy thanked the UK for the support shown to Ukraine since the invasion. As he met Sunak at Chequers, Zelenskiy said: “Your support is already a lot for us, you did a lot – you, your government and his majesty the king and of course your people, your society. We are thankful from all our hearts, from Ukrainians, from our soldiers, we are thankful.” Zelenskiy said his discussions with Sunak would cover “very important issues, urgent support for Ukraine”. The crisis was a matter of “security not only for Ukraine, it is important for all of Europe” he added. Here is some video of the arrival. Updated at 11.23am BST 11.11am BST The Kremlin said on Monday that it categorically disagreed with French President Emmanuel Macron, who said that Russia had “entered a form of subservience with regards to China” since being shunned by the west over the conflict in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia’s ties with China were those of a strategic partner and had nothing to do with dependence. Updated at 11.22am BST 11.01am BST Summary of the day so far … Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived at Chequers in Buckinghamshire for talks with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak. The prime minister published an image of the pair of them embracing. Zelenskiy’s visit comes off the back of trips to Berlin and Paris, and with the UK last week having pledged to send longer ranger cruise missiles to support Ukraine’s efforts to oust Russian forces from its territory. Ahead of the trip Zelenskiy tweeted: “The UK is a leader when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face-to-face and in delegations.” Sunak said in a statement:“This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke. They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year. We must not let them down.” Zelenskiy issued a new appeal to Nato on Monday to make a “positive political decision” on Kyiv’s membership at its July summit. Zelenskiy made his remarks in a video address to the Copenhagen democracy summit. He said that Finland joining Nato showed the strength of security guarantees, and thanked Denmark and other allies for their resolve in assisting Ukraine against Russia. The defence of Bakhmut continues and recent days have shown that Ukraine can move forward and counter the Russian forces there, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Monday. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, is reporting that four people have been killed in a Russian strike on a hospital in Avdiivka, in Donetsk oblast. Leonid Pasechnik, the Russian-installed head of Ukraine’s occupied Luhansk region, has posted to Telegram to say that there are no casualties reported from the earlier reported Ukrainian shelling of Luhansk. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has said no additional negotiations on the Black Sea grain initiative are planned for this week. Russia’s air defences continue to be compromised after a core airbase in the western part of the country was struck by several uncrewed aerial vehicles on 3 May, the latest UK intelligence briefing has said. Russia’s Seshcha airbase, located 150km north of the Ukrainian border, has played a major role in enabling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is also used to launch uncrewed aerial vehicles towards Kyiv. South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Monday the country’s non-aligned position did not favour Russia over other states and reiterated its call for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. A top Chinese envoy will begin a tour of Ukraine, Russia and other European cities on Monday in a trip Beijing says is aimed at discussing a “political settlement” to the Ukraine crisis. Li Hui, China’s special representative for Eurasian affairs and former ambassador to Russia, will also visit Poland, France, Germany on the multi-day trip. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force, allegedly offered to reveal the position of Russian troops to the Ukranian government, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing leaked US intelligence documents.

Over the weekend Berlin announced Germany’s largest pledge in military aid since the start of the war. In a statement, the German defence ministry said the package would include 30 Leopard and 20 Marder tanks from industrial reserves, as well as armoured personnel carriers, reconnaissance drones and ammunition. At the Charlmagne ceremony in the western German city of Aachen, Zelenskiy thanked chancellor Olaf Scholz for his “fantastic solidarity”, saying “everything in this security package will significantly strengthen our defence”. The Charlemagne Prize, named after the Frankish founder of what became the Holy Roman empire, is the oldest prize to be awarded for services to European unification.

I’m not at all surprised that Zelenskiy will be coming here asking for more.” Andriy Yermak from Zelenskiy’s office said that Ukraine’s potential future membership of Nato would be on the agenda.

PA report that speaking on Times Radio on Monday, the former chief of the general staff said the Russian military “might crumble” in an anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive later this year. He said: “The major counter-offensive which we are all expecting and which the Ukrainians are preparing for has not begun yet but probably is not that far away. If Ukraine is going to succeed in its stated objective of freeing its territory from Russian occupation this is the year they’ve got to do it. “There is a danger that western support will wane. There is also a danger that Putin will see that time is on his side, so it is really important that the Ukrainians do mount this offensive effectively at the right time. “If there are decisive blows struck against the Russians there is a chance that Russian military morale might crack and the Russian army might crumble in the way that we saw around Kharkiv last September.” 9.45am BST Suspilne, Ukraine&apos;s state broadcaster, is reporting that explosions have been heard in Yevpatoriya, on the west coast of Crimea, which Russia unilaterally annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

It says: In their talks, the prime minister will reiterate the importance the UK places on providing a total package of support to Ukraine to put them in the strongest possible position to secure a lasting peace for their country. This means the military equipment we provide must be bolstered by training, by economic support, by biting sanctions against Putin’s regime and by long-term security assurances to ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty can never be breached in this way again. To that end, in the last year the UK has trained 15,000 Ukrainian troops to battlefield readiness. In February the prime minister announced the UK would develop a new training programme for Ukrainian pilots to support their efforts to build a new Ukrainian air force with Nato-standard, F16 jets. This summer we will commence an elementary flying phase for cohorts of Ukrainian pilots to learn basic training.

His comments in a weekly presidential newsletter came on the heels of US allegations last week that weapons were loaded on to a Russian ship from a naval base in Cape Town late last year, which sparked a diplomatic row. South African officials swiftly rejected claims made by the US ambassador to South Africa. “We do not accept that our non-aligned position favours Russia above other countries. Nor do we accept that it should imperil our relations with other countries,” Reuters reports Ramaphosa said. South Africa would continue to honour international agreements and treaties it is a signatory to and its approach to US allegations of arms shipment would abide by them, he added. US ambassador Reuben Brigety was summoned on Friday to meet South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor and he apologised “unreservedly” to the government and the people of South Africa, a foreign ministry statement said. “I was grateful for the opportunity to speak with Foreign Minister Pandor … and correct any misimpressions left by my public remarks,” Brigety said in a tweet that did not confirm whether he had apologised.

We, of course, had a great time on Saturday [referring to hosting the Eurovision song contest on behalf of Ukraine], but the serious stuff is not to forget the plight of those in Ukraine. Many women older Ukrainians and children are in London. And it’s really important we’ve opened our doors to Ukrainians The men are fighting bravely against Putin’s forces, and it’s really important that not just our prime minister, but President Macron and European allies provide continued support to the brave people of Ukraine. 7.44am BST Sunak: &apos;UK is sustaining our support to Ukraine&apos; Rishi Sunak has said the UK will be “sustaining our support” for Ukraine as he prepares to meet the country’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for talks in London on Monday. PA quotes the prime minister as saying: “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke. “They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year. “We must not let them down. “The frontlines of Putin’s war of aggression may be in Ukraine but the fault lines stretch all over the world. It is in all our interest to ensure Ukraine succeeds and Putin’s barbarism is not rewarded. “That is why the UK is sustaining our support to Ukraine – from tanks to training, ammunition to armoured vehicles. And this message of solidarity will ring loud in all my meetings with fellow world leaders in the days ahead.” The statement does not mention aircraft, which has been a repeated request from Ukraine which wants more modern air power to defend its cities. Updated at 7.46am BST 7.24am BST A Liverpool man has spoken to the PA news agency, saying there were “so many extremely moving moments” during a trip made by a group of fellow aid workers to his home town for the Eurovision song contest. Tim Johnson, a 37-year-old IT consultant, brought a group of volunteers: six Ukrainians and six Poles; who have worked with Ukrainians affected by war, to the UK to take part in Eurovision events. Two of the group travelled from Ukraine via Warsaw, while the others joined Johnson from Poland, to watch two rehearsals for the Eurovision song contest and watch the grand final in Liverpool’s fan village. One of the volunteers received a message during the show that her Ukrainian home of Ternopil had been attacked shortly before the Ukrainian band, Tvorchi, was to perform. Johnson said the news of the missile strike on Ternopil – which is also the home town of the Ukrainian act – was a “moment of sheer fear and panic”. “I had to get her very quickly out of a maintenance gate and try to make a call to check if everyone was alright and luckily her family were, but it’s just another example of what they’re going through.” Some of the visiting aid workers by the Beatles statue in Liverpool. Photograph: Tim Johnson/PA In the run-up to the final, the group draped Ukrainian flags on the statue of the Beatles on Liverpool’s waterfront. Johnson said the large flag attracted the attention of passersby, saying: “Literally hundreds of people gathered around taking photos and nobody said a word but you could just feel the huge outpouring of support there.” He continued: “It was one of those lump-in-the-throat moments. It’s hard not to be moved by so many people gathering around like that and the silent support.” Updated at 7.41am BST 7.17am BST On Telegram, Andriy Yermak from Zelenskiy’s office has added a little more detail about the Ukrainian president’s trip to London, saying: Today there are important meetings in London. We are working on strengthening the defense of Ukraine and supporting our progress with Nato. Zelenskiy will be attending the next major Nato summit in person, with Ukraine pushing for more concrete steps and a timetable for joining the alliance. Updated at 7.18am BST 7.11am BST Volodymyr Zelenskiy to meet Rishi Sunak in London on Monday Ukraine’s president has announced that he will arrive in London on Monday for talks with UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak. In a tweet, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: Today – London. The UK is a leader when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face-to-face and in delegations. Today – London.

Updated at 7.14am BST 7.06am BST The defence of Bakhmut continues and recent days have shown that Ukraine can move forward and counter the Russian forces there, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Monday. “The advance of our troops along the Bakhmut direction – that is the first successful offensive operation in the city’s defence,” Reuters quotes Syrskyi as saying on Ukraine’s media military centre Telegram channek. “The last few days have shown that we can move forward and destroy the enemy even in such extremely difficult conditions. The operation to defend Bakhmut continues. All necessary decisions for the defence have been made.” It has been impossible for journalists to independently verify the battlefield situation in fiercely contested Bakhmut for months, with both sides engaged in the war issuing claims and counter-claims about progress. Updated at 7.08am BST 6.58am BST Russia’s air defences compromised, says UK MoD Russia’s air defences continue to be compromised after a core airbase in the western part of the country was struck by several uncrewed aerial vehicles on 3 May, the latest UK intelligence briefing has said. Russia’s Seshcha Airbase, located 150km north of the Ukrainian border, has played a major role in enabling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is also used to launch uncrewed aerial vehicles towards Kyiv. The briefing said: The VTA [Russia’s Military Transport Aviation] is a well-resourced element of the Russian Air Force, essential for transport across the vast country. Russian leaders will be concerned that Russia’s air defences continue to be compromised, holding at risk key strategic assets such as VTA bases.

Li Hui, China’s special representative for Eurasian affairs and former ambassador to Russia, will also visit Poland, France, Germany on the multi-day trip, the foreign ministry announced Friday without providing a detailed schedule. He is the most senior Chinese official to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded in February last year, and his trip could coincide with the beginnings of a long anticipated counteroffensive by Ukraine to recapture territory seized by Russia. 6.36am BST Increasingly regular series of Russian drone and missile strikes are likely part of a new campaign focussed on Kyiv aimed at degrading Ukrainian abilities to conduct counteroffensive operations, according to US a thinktank. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in its daily update on Monday said Russian forces conducted another series of drone and missile strikes over Saturday and Sunday night. It comes after the forces have conducted at least 10 series of strikes throughout Ukraine since 19 April. It reported the new air campaign has been more regular than previous Russian campaigns against critical infrastructure, however the forces are using fewer high precision missiles. 6.23am BST Here are the latest images coming across the wires from Ukraine: Children watch the performance of the group 4.5.0. at the festival in honor of Mother’s Day at the City Garden in Odessa, Ukraine.

Wagner’s soldiers have been at the forefront of a bloody Russian offensive to take the city of Bakhmut. In exchange for Ukraine withdrawing its soldiers from the area, Prigozhin in January offered to tell its intelligence service the positions of Russian forces, the Post reported. The paper said Ukraine rejected the offer. Prigozhin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has publicly threatened to withdraw his mercenaries from the area around Bakhmut, where they are at the vanguard of the Russian offensive, unless they receive much-needed ammunition. He said Tuesday in an audio message that he and his men would be regarded as traitors if they abandoned the area. The Post reported Prigozhin’s offer came through his contacts with Ukraine’s intelligence service. 6.00am BST France to send dozens of armoured vehicles, light tanks to Ukraine France will send to Ukraine in the coming weeks dozens of armoured vehicles and light tanks, including the AMX-10RCs fighting vehicles, according to a joint statement issued after President Emmanuel Macron’s talks with Ukraine’s president, Reuters reports. After a working dinner that lasted more than three hours between Macron and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the French presidency indicated that Paris was also concentrating its efforts on supporting Kyiv’s air defence capabilities against Russian strikes. This evening, with President Zelensky, we took stock of Ukraine&apos;s operational needs to face Russia&apos;s aggression. France will continue to provide political, financial, humanitarian and military support to the Ukrainians as long as it takes.… — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 14, 2023 After securing a bumper $3 billion new military package from Germany over the weekend, Zelenskiy said in Berlin on Sunday that Kyiv and its allies could make a Russian defeat “irreversible” as early as this year. A source at the French presidency told reporters that additional, more modern defence systems would be made available to Ukraine. 5.48am BST Key event G7 leaders to target Russian energy, trade in new sanctions steps Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations plan to tighten sanctions on Russia at their summit in Japan this week, with steps aimed at energy and exports aiding Moscow’s war effort, said officials with direct knowledge of the discussions, Reuters reports. New measures announced by the leaders during the May 19-21 meetings will target sanctions evasion involving third countries, and seek to undermine Russia’s future energy production and curb trade that supports Russia’s military, the people said. Separately, U.S. officials also expect G7 members will agree to adjust their approach to sanctions so that, at least for certain categories of goods, all exports are automatically banned unless they are on a list of approved items. That change could make it harder for Moscow to find gaps in the sanctions regime. The exact areas where these new rules would apply are still being discussed. Updated at 6.17am BST 5.38am BST Opening summary Hello and welcome back to our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine, now in its 446th day. I’m Jordyn Beazley and here’s a look at the latest. Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries plan to tighten sanctions on Russia at their summit in Japan this week, with steps aimed at energy and exports aiding Moscow’s war effort, officials with direct knowledge of the discussions told the Reuters news agency. Meanwhile, France has announced dozens more light tanks and armoured vehicles for Ukraine’s army, together with training for the soldiers using them, after talks between the Ukrainian and French presidents in Paris. Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Emmanuel Macron also called for fresh sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The leaders’ joint statement also said Paris would focus its efforts “in supporting Ukraine’s air defence capacities”. French president Emmanuel Macron, left, meets with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Paris. Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters More on both stories soon. In other developments: The two leaders’ comments came after Zelenskiy flew into France late on Sunday on a whistle-stop tour of Europe and joined Macron for a dinner at the Élysée Palace. Zelenskiy had tweeted earlier as he arrived in France at an airbase in Villacoublay, south-west of Paris: “With each visit, Ukraine’s defense and offensive capabilities are expanding.” Zelenskiy thanked Germany for its support and what he called the largest military aid package since the beginning of Russia’s invasion as he met with president Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin on Sunday. The trip came after the German government announced a new military package worth €2.7bn as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia. During Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Germany, he was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne prize on behalf of the Ukrainian people in honour of services to Europe. The Ukrainian president received the award, which honours services to European unification, in the western city of Aachen with Olaf Scholz after their talks in Berlin. Russia has said two of its military commanders were killed in eastern Ukraine, as Kyiv’s forces renewed efforts to break through Russian defences in the embattled city of Bakhmut. The Russian defence ministry said on Sunday that commander Vyacheslav Makarov of the 4th motorised rifle brigade and deputy commander Yevgeny Brovko from a separate unit were killed trying to repel Ukrainian attacks. Russia has “already lost geopolitically” its war in Ukraine and is transforming into a vassal state of China, Emmanuel Macron has said. “De facto, it has entered a form of subservience with regards to China and has lost its access to the Baltic, which was critical, because it prompted the decision by Sweden and Finland to join Nato,” the French president said in an interview with Opinion newspaper published on Sunday. Russian forces are much diminished since the start of the war, the UK Ministry of Defence has said, with troops consisting of mostly poorly trained mobilised reservists and increasingly reliant on antiquated equipment. Many of its units were severely under strength, it said. Updated at 5.41am BST</body>

    <head>Campaigners welcome Kate Winslet plea about online safety and children</head>
    <body>Online safety campaigners have welcomed Kate Winslet’s call on “people in power” to criminalise harmful digital content during her Bafta acceptance speech, as the UK parliament debates legislation to rein in social media platforms. The actor won the television award on Sunday for her portrayal of a mother whose teenage daughter suffers from mental health problems as a result of viewing damaging online content. Accepting the award for best leading actress for Channel 4 drama I am Ruth, in which she acted alongside her real-life daughter, Mia Threapleton, Winslet said: “We want our children back.” She added: “For young people who have become addicted to social media and its darker sides, this does not need to be your life. To people in power, and to people who can make change, please, criminalise harmful content.” The Molly Rose Foundation, established by the family of teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing material related to self-harm and suicide on social media, said it was time the government “listened to the chorus of concerned parents” and delivered strong legislation on shielding young people from damaging digital content. Molly Russell. Photograph: PA Referring to Prince William’s call for better protection of children online following an inquest into Russell’s death last year, a spokesperson for the foundation said: “It makes no difference if you are the winner of a best actress Bafta or the heir to the throne: families across the UK are concerned about keeping children safe in our unregulated digital world. “It’s not only the readily found harmful content that causes concern, but also the tech platforms’ algorithms that push digital dangers to vulnerable young people every day.” The spokesperson added that the government must deliver an online safety bill that addressed the scale of the problem. The bill imposes a duty of care on tech firms to shield children from harmful content, but members of the House of Lords are currently trying to strengthen the legislation. A cross-party group of peers, led by the former culture secretary Nicky Morgan, will put forward a range of measures when the bill is debated in the upper chamber on Tuesday. Under the proposals, social media bosses could face jail terms of up to two years for persistent breaches. Beeban Kidron, a leading online safety campaigner, said: “Kate Winslet is giving voice to what millions of parents and children are expressing.” Lady Kidron added that the government was “pushing back” on some amendments in the upper chamber. Peers are seeking changes including stronger rules on age-checking measures and setting out children’s rights on the face of the bill.“I would like a commitment from No 10 to strengthening the bill for children, and for parliament as a whole to put its weight behind the needs of children to thrive online.” The NSPCC said Winslet’s remarks would “resonate with parents up and down the country”. “Regulation will start to bring the tech sector in line with other industries and ensure they have to assess and mitigate the risks of their products so they are safe for young users, but the pushback from some companies will be considerable,” said Rani Govender, senior child safety online policy officer at the NSPCC, which is calling for the bill to introduce an independent child online safety advocate. A government spokesperson said the “world-leading” online safety bill would protect children on a range of platforms including social media networks, video-sharing sites and search engines, and that companies that breached the act would face fines of up to 10% of global turnover. “Protecting children from being exposed to harmful content and behaviour such as bullying is an absolute priority for the government,” said the spokesperson.

    <head>Sunderland: brothers jailed over £2m Ehic scam</head>
    <body>Two brothers have been jailed for defrauding £2m from “unsuspecting, ordinary, busy” people who were tricked into thinking they needed to pay for European health insurance cards (Ehics). Damien Sartip Zadeh, 32, was jailed for nine and a half years and his brother Dale, 35, got eight years after being found guilty of fraudulent trading and laundering the proceeds between February 2013 and October 2019. Their parents, Mahmud and Diane Sartip Zadeh, 62 and 60, were found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years. The elaborate scam involved a computer program pushing their misleading websites to the top of internet search results so that people were tricked into needlessly paying for an Ehic. National Trading Standards, which led the investigation, said websites set up by the brothers were “a front for a clever cut-and-paste job”, with customers’ details simply copied over into the free NHS website form. NTS said Damien Sartip Zadeh was also convicted of engaging in aggressive commercial practices by threatening people who complained. The judge Penny Belcher said that when consumers realised they had been scammed and tried to get refunds, “thoroughly aggressive and nasty threats” were used. Michael Bichard, the chair of NTS, said: “This was a case of serious and organised fraud where large sums were taken from unsuspecting, ordinary, busy people and the sites were a scam from start to finish.” The sentences were handed out to the Sunderland family at Leeds crown court on Monday. NTS investigators test-bought Ehics through a fraudulent site that had the URL ehic-cards.org.uk, with fictional “check and send” and fast-track functions. The site had a similar colour and background to NHS and government websites and was aimed at misleading consumers into thinking they were using official channels. Guy Parker, the chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority, welcomed the sentencing and said the scams could have affected anyone “from the vulnerable to the tech savvy”. He said: “It sends a clear signal to bogus operators behind misleading websites that fraudulent practices will be met with the force of the law. The scale of and the aggressive practices behind this scam are a reminder to everyone about the need to be vigilant when making online purchases.” The brothers have also been disqualified from being company directors for 10 years. Their father was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and was disqualified from being a director for five years. Ehics were issued free of charge by the government allowing people to access medically necessary state-provided healthcare when visiting an EU country or Switzerland. They have since been replaced by the global health insurance card (GHIC).</body>

    <head>EU approves Microsoft’s takeover of Activision Blizzard</head>
    <body>The EU has approved Microsoft’s $69bn (£55bn) acquisition of the Call of Duty creator Activision Blizzard, in a move that drew immediate pushback from its UK counterpart, which has already blocked the gaming mega-deal. The EU accepted Microsoft’s concessions on cloud gaming, the same problem that led the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to block the transaction last month. The proposed deal aims to bring together Microsoft, the maker of the Xbox console, with the video game developer whose hit titles also include World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Candy Crush Saga and Overwatch. Related: Ignore Microsoft’s whines about the Activision Blizzard takeover. The CMA did its job | Nils Pratley The approval by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, will revive Microsoft’s hopes for the deal as it prepares to appeal against the CMA’s decision. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US has also come out against the takeover and is suing to block it. The commission’s preliminary investigation had found that the deal could harm competition in cloud gaming, which allows users to stream video games stored on remote servers on to their devices, and in the supply of rival PC operating systems. It was concerned that if gamers could stream Call of Duty only via a Windows-exclusive streaming service then they may be less likely to switch to other operating systems such as Mac OS or Linux. However, the commission said on Monday it had accepted Microsoft’s proposed remedies. The compromise involves Microsoft offering free licences over a 10-year period allowing European consumers who purchase Activision PC and console games to stream them on other cloud gaming services. The EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said the decision would bring Activision’s games to “many more devices and consumers than before thanks to cloud game streaming”. She added: “The commitments offered by Microsoft will enable for the first time the streaming of such games in any cloud game streaming services, enhancing competition and opportunities for growth.” The CMA said it stood by its decision to block the deal. “Microsoft’s proposals, accepted by the European Commission today, would allow Microsoft to set the terms and conditions for this market for the next 10 years,” said Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive. The EU decision will help Microsoft if the US tech firm succeeds in overturning the CMA in the UK’s competition appeal tribunal, said Anne Witt, a professor of antitrust law at the EDHEC business school in France. Otherwise, the UK’s objection could still force the abandonment of the transaction, Witt added. “It makes a difference if they manage to get the decision overturned in the UK competition appeal tribunal. But if Microsoft loses in the UK, it’s still game over, unless Microsoft decides to withdraw from the UK market,” she said. The FTC is seeking to block the Activision acquisition, although some legal experts argue that, based on historical precedent, the regulator might struggle to prevail against Microsoft. Both the UK and European Commission agreed on the substance of the concerns; each regulator confirmed that there was little danger of the large and competitive market for console games being warped by the acquisition, but much greater risk in the nascent industry of cloud gaming being dominated by Microsoft. The two regulators differed, however, in whether or not Microsoft’s proposed remedies would be sufficient to reduce that risk. Where the commission said they were, the UK’s CMA instead argued that it was impossible to provide a useful remedy, since the market was in such flux that Microsoft could not know what promises it had to make to preserve competition. What is more, the CMA added last month, the very act of Microsoft making such promises could itself warp the market, by forcing the development of future competitors to align with the commitments that Microsoft had made. Activision indicated that the UK’s objection could scupper the deal in a notice to shareholders in March in which it said the transaction could be terminated if “any action has been taken by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction, that … prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation of the merger and has become final and non-appealable.” Activision’s chief executive, Bobby Kotick, who lambasted the CMA’s decision last month as evidence that the UK was “closed for business”, said the EU had “conducted an extremely thorough, deliberate process to gain a comprehensive understanding of gaming”. The Microsoft president, Brad Smith, said: “The European Commission has required Microsoft to license popular Activision Blizzard games automatically to competing cloud gaming services. This will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose.”</body>

    <head>‘If you go down, I’m going down too’: the music stars protesting US anti-drag laws</head>
    <body>“The energy was honestly like nothing I’ve ever experienced,” recalls the drag performer Britney Banks of her recent surprise appearance at a Lizzo concert at Knoxville, Tennessee’s Thompson-Boling arena. “The roof could have come off.” Related: I’m a drag queen in Tennessee. The state’s anti-drag law is silly, nasty, and wrong | Bella DuBalle Banks is referring to the moment she and a group of fellow performers were invited onstage by Lizzo for a performance of the star’s 2022 song Everybody’s Gay in direct defiance of the restrictive anti-LGBTQ+ laws and sentiment bubbling up in the state. “We came from backstage and walked out on two separate sides,” says Banks. “We were only out there for a minute and a half, but it was the craziest feeling I’ve ever felt.” As the audience cheered, Lizzo spoke candidly into the microphone about the meaning of the moment. “In light of recent tragic and current events, I was told, ‘Cancel your shows in Tennessee,’” the Grammy-winner said. “But why would I not come to the people who need to hear this message the most? Why would I not create a safe space in Tennessee where we can celebrate drag entertainers?” Lizzo is part of a larger trend emerging in Tennessee of major music stars using their platform to raise awareness for the drag and LGBTQ+ community at large in light of a flurry of legislation in the southern US which directly attacks trans people and drag performers, including legislation signed by the Republican governor of Tennessee, Bill Lee, which restricts “adult cabarets”. While that specific law has since been temporarily blocked, artists ranging from Hayley Kiyoko to Orville Peck and Kelsea Ballerini have used their tour stops to dedicate a portion of their performance to advocate against the anti-drag and trans sentiment emerging in the deep south of the US. Kiyoko invited two drag queens from the Nashville watering hole Play Dance Bar to join her on stage the next night during her performance in the city at Marathon Music Works as part of her ongoing Panorama tour. “I was advised by local law enforcement that having a drag performance at my all-ages show could result in legal action,” she later wrote on social media, noting that an “undercover cop” delivered the warnings. “I never want to put anyone in a position to be at risk or in danger in any way. But also where is the line of being silenced?” Drag performers LiberTea and Ivy St James made the decision to forge on, subsequently appearing on stage alongside Kiyoko without incident. “They showed no fear and said they wanted to continue with the show and come out onstage, so they did,” the singer later said. “Lizzo and other artists reach audiences that many advocates can’t otherwise reach,” says Chris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project and the Tennessee Equality Project Foundation. “Their actions simultaneously tell huge numbers of people what is happening and show a path forward for fighting against authoritarian laws. When I saw the news of her creative approach to fighting our discriminatory laws, it was a moment of relief and happiness because it said that we’re not alone in Tennessee.” Trixie Mattel and Orville Peck. Photograph: Stewart Cook/Shutterstock Ballerini used her national platform at the CMT awards to invite drag performers, including Manila Luzon and Olivia Lux, on stage during her performance at the ceremony last month in Austin, Texas. “If you go down, I’m going down too,” the singer wrote on social media about the performance, alluding to her 2022 song of the same name. Meanwhile, Orville Peck has made it a recurring theme in his show to invite drag performers on stage during a series of performances in the south. “[Drag] is a cornerstone of not just gay culture but gay civil rights,” he later told Variety. “It is literally why I have the ability to be an openly gay man in country music. Was I scared? Yes, but I did it anyway because sometimes you just have to do something no matter what.” The Nashville-based drag performer Alexia Noelle Paris joined Peck on a run of six dates after being in touch on social media. “The crowd received my presence positively, and the energy felt different than just having me join on stage as a background performer,” said Noelle of the experience. “He truly gave me the spotlight to shine. It was nice to hear how much people enjoyed my performance or how I was their first drag experience. It also was great to show them that drag is not dangerous or something to fear, but simply an art.” According to the president and CEO of Glaad, Sarah Kate Ellis, three dozen separate pieces of anti-drag legislation have emerged in 16 states in the past year alone. “Drag artists have been under unprecedented, baseless attacks from a small group of extremists,” she says. “What people see in the media and from entertainers has a huge impact on how they treat each other and the decisions they make every day in schools, living rooms, offices, courtrooms and all over our culture.” Kelsea Ballerini, center, performs accompanied by, from left, drag queens Manila Luzon, Jan Sport, Olivia Lux and Kennedy Davenport.

After Banks appeared at Nashville’s Love Rising benefit show, which was organized in reaction to the law and drew 10,000 people to Bridgestone arena, Lizzo’s team subsequently reached out to figure out how the star could make a statement. “We had a week and half to book all the queens and later we rehearsed with her choreographer,” says Banks, who is currently in Los Angeles prepping a fundraising show for Inclusion Tennessee at Micky’s in West Hollywood, a direct result of her appearance in Knoxville. “It’s been a whirlwind but a really cool experience.” According to Kate Ellis, the representation from coast to coast has powerful implications. “These artists, and performers, send a strong message to youth everywhere: no matter who you are, you are beautiful and you belong,” she says.</body>

    <head>Former Met PC ‘missed chance’ to investigate Wayne Couzens</head>
    <body>A Metropolitan police officer allegedly “did not bother” to properly investigate Wayne Couzens over two incidents of flashing hours before he kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard. Former PC Samantha Lee is accused of conducting an “extremely poor” investigation after Couzens exposed himself to female staff at a drive-through McDonald’s in Kent on 14 and 27 February 2021, a police disciplinary hearing was told. Lee reportedly failed to secure the relevant CCTV footage when she attended the restaurant on 3 March, hours before Couzens abducted Everard, 33, in Clapham, south-west London. It is alleged that Lee’s behaviour suggests “she was more intent in getting away quickly than in performing her duties properly”, the hearing on Monday heard. Lee, who was based in the South Area Command Unit, is also said to have lied and made “a bogus allegation” when questioned about her actions, claiming she believed that the CCTV at the restaurant deleted automatically. She denies gross misconduct and breaching the force’s standards. While under investigation for the alleged failings, she reportedly quit the force and set up an OnlyFans account called Officer Naughty. Couzens is serving a whole-life term at HMP Frankland for the kidnap, rape and murder of Everard. In March, he was sentenced to 19 months in prison after admitting three counts of indecent exposure. The first offence related to an incident in November 2020 in which Couzens performed a sex act and exposed himself to a female cyclist on a country lane in Kent while on duty. A manager at a McDonald’s in Kent said female staff members were “horrified” after the two drive-through incidents in February 2021. “On both occasions the customer was sitting in his car with his trousers fully down and his penis out on display,” he said in a statement. The manager made a 999 call to police on 28 February, providing the last four digits of Couzens’ Mastercard number and his number plate. He also correctly identified the car as a black Seat Exeo. Opening the case on behalf of the Met police on Monday, Paul Ozin KC told the hearing that after the manager reported the incidents, the matter was triaged and recorded as “less urgent” than other matters the force had to deal with. He said a computer check was done after the report, which confirmed that the black Seat Exeo had been registered to Couzens since January 2018, and gave his home address. “There is no standard check that takes place to see whether a suspect in criminal police cases are police officers,” he added. Lee attended the restaurant three days later, on the afternoon of 3 March. It was her last appointment of the day. “We suggest that the work carried out was a rushed job,” Ozin said. He said the manager claims to have explained to Lee that while the drive-through CCTV deletes automatically, other CCTV footage showed Couzens’ car. He claimed that he showed her the other CCTV. The manager also showed her receipts that recorded the last four digits of Couzens’ card on both occasions, as well as witness statements taken from two members of staff. Ozin told the hearing that Lee’s case was that she spoke to the manager when she attended the restaurant, but he did not show her any CCTV footage of the incident. He said she accepted that she did indeed take possession of receipts and witness statements. In a report made after attending the restaurant, Lee recommended that Couzens be arrested and questioned. Ozin said Lee claimed that she believed the report would be allocated to a different team to follow up on. However, Ozin said she did not put the witness statements and the receipts in a sealed evidence bag, instead keeping them in a pocket in her body armour. He added: “One of the central issues of this case is whether there has been some horrible misunderstanding.” He said Lee’s behaviour “suggests that she was more intent in getting away quickly than in performing her duties properly … It is supportive of the unpalatable conclusion that PC Lee just did not bother to get the CCTV, even though she knew it was important, instead relying on others to do that instead of her. And that she later lied to others when she knew that the stakes had escalated astronomically.” He said when “one looks at the landscape across the board, simply not bothering in relation to the CCTV is entirely plausible in the case of PC Lee”. He added: “The general standard of her investigation was extremely poor, suggesting she treated the allegation as a low-grade allegation that need not be dealt with by her personally and could be dealt with by others. “She had a great incentive to not be candid about her failings. She made things up and seized upon the other things [the manager] had said to make a bogus allegation.” The charge against Lee alleges she “failed to undertake the correct investigative inquiries into an allegation of indecent exposure and subsequently provided a misleading account of her actions when questioned about them”. She is said to have breached the force’s standards on duties and responsibilities as well as honesty and integrity. If she is found to have committed gross misconduct, she could be banned from serving in the force again. The misconduct hearing at Palestra House in Southwark, south London, is expected to last seven days.</body>

    <head>Images of Lukashenko released after rumours over Belarusian leader’s health</head>
    <body>Belarusian authorities have released photographs and video of Alexander Lukashenko, attempting to put an end to a week of speculation about the authoritarian leader’s health. The footage showed Lukashenko visiting an army control point, but the ruler’s heavily bandaged arm and hoarse, exhausted voice appeared to confirm rumours that he has been in poor health. Lukashenko had not been seen in public since last Tuesday, when he attended a military parade in Moscow. Rumours circulated that he had been admitted to hospital on his return to Minsk. The opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled the country after a ruthless crackdown on opponents in 2020, told her supporters on Monday to be “well prepared for every scenario”. Shortly after, a Telegram channel linked to Lukashenko’s administration released a photograph of the Belarusian leader, apparently visiting a military command centre, dressed in military fatigues and with his left arm heavily bandaged. Later, the channel released video footage of Lukashenko, apparently on the same visit, holding a meeting about the security situation in the country. “As I understand, the situation is not critical, but nevertheless worrying,” he said, speaking with difficulty in a meeting with generals. Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994. A former collective farm manager, he has often been referred to as “the last dictator in Europe” and his regime took an even more repressive turn after mass protests in 2020. Tsikhanouskaya ran against Lukashenko in elections that year that were widely seen as rigged. Her husband had been barred from standing in the election and jailed. After the vote, Lukashenko’s security forces eventually crushed the huge protest movements, with widespread arrests, violence, and many opposition-minded Belarusians leaving the country. “There are many rumours about the dictator Lukashenko’s health,” Tsikhanouskaya tweeted to supporters on Monday. “For us, it means only one thing: we should be well prepared for every scenario. To turn Belarus on the path to democracy and to prevent Russia from interfering. We need the international community to be proactive and fast.” Lukashenko and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, have often had a strained relationship, but the Belarusian leader has aided Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, allowing his country’s territory to be used as a base for launching attacks. He is now Moscow’s closest ally in Europe, and the Kremlin will be watching his health closely. Before Monday’s footage emerged, Lukashenko was last seen in public on 9 May, when he was one of the few international leaders to travel to Moscow to view the annual parade marking Victory Day. Lukashenko looked unsteady on his feet in the footage and had a bandage on his right hand. He missed a lunch hosted by Putin. On Sunday, he missed a ceremony in Minsk, amid rumours that he had been admitted to hospital. Flight tracking data showed that a Russian government plane flew in and out of Minsk over the weekend, but it was not clear who was on board, or whether the mission was related to Lukashenko’s health. Related: Alexander Lukashenko has effectively ceded control to Kremlin, say opposition During his reappearance on Monday, Lukashenko also managed to inadvertently confirm the loss of four aircraft by Russia’s military on Saturday, according to quotes attributed to him by his press service. The Belarusian leader referred to “the events near us – I mean in the Bryansk region, when four aircraft were shot down”. The Russian newspaper Kommersant and several Russian military bloggers reported over the weekend that two Russian fighter jets and two helicopters had been shot down in the Bryansk oblast, apparently as they were about to launch a bombing raid across the border with Ukraine. Russian authorities have only confirmed that one jet and one helicopter had been lost, citing a crash and engine fire respectively. Ukrainian authorities have not claimed responsibility for the attack inside Russia, but an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, described it as “instant karma”.</body>

    <head>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville obituary</head>
    <body>The former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Brooke, who has died aged 89, ought to be remembered as the Northern Ireland secretary who inaugurated the province’s delicate peace process, or even as the founding minister for the National Lottery. But he will probably be recalled for briefly singing a song on an Irish TV chat show the night when seven Protestant construction workers were killed by an IRA bomb. The singing of My Darling Clementine in Dublin on Gay Byrne’s Late Late Show shortly after the atrocity, in January 1992, was a mistake for which Brooke apologised and offered his resignation, but he had an understandable excuse. Brooke had had a hard week working in Belfast and had barely heard about the attack in County Tyrone. However, he was chiefly disconcerted by being asked unexpectedly about the traumatic death of his first wife, with his new wife sitting in the studio audience – and was then cajoled by Byrne into singing the only song he knew. “My defences were down … it was patently an error,” he said later. It was a measure of Brooke’s popularity in the Commons that when he apologised unreservedly in the chamber the following week he received cross-party support, with only Ian Paisley’s hardline Democratic Unionists demanding his resignation. The prime minister, John Major, supported Brooke at the time, but dropped him a few months later after unexpectedly winning the April 1992 general election. He was brought back into the cabinet as culture secretary that September following the resignation of David Mellor. Brooke was well liked in the house because he was an old-style Tory, not one of the highly partisan Thatcherite ministers who surrounded him in government. He was emollient, cultivated and charming, with a passion for cricket – and a penchant for using it as a metaphor. Before entering parliament he had been a successful management consultant. Brooke was born in London into a political family: his father, Henry, was a hardline home secretary in the last days of the Macmillan and Home administrations, who was responsible in the Profumo affair for the prosecution of Stephen Ward. His mother, Barbara (nee Matthews), was a London councillor and had been a vice-chair of the Conservative party for 10 years. Both parents were given life peerages and sat together in the Lords, as Lord Brooke of Cumnor and Lady Brooke of Ystradfellte. The oldest of four children, Peter followed in his father’s footsteps by being educated at Marlborough and Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied classics and became president of the Oxford Union debating society and president of the university Christian Association. After graduating in 1957 he studied for an MBA at Harvard and Lausanne, and joined a management consultancy, working for periods in the 1970s in Brussels, Switzerland and New York. If it was always likely that he would eventually enter politics, he did not do so without difficulty. He applied for nomination in 27 constituencies and stood unsuccessfully in the Labour seat of Bedwellty against Neil Kinnock in the October 1974 election, where he came in nearly 23,000 votes behind and lost his deposit. It was not until 1977, when he was 42, that he was nominated for the safe Tory seat of the City of London and Westminster. He won the byelection there that followed the resignation of Christopher Tugendhat, who was becoming a European commissioner. Brooke held the seat until his retirement from the Commons in 2001. He became a junior government whip following the 1979 election and served time as a junior minister in the Department of Education (1983-85) and then the Treasury (1985-87), where he was put in charge of Customs and Excise. It was a surprise when Margaret Thatcher made him party chair after the 1987 election. Despite the Tories’ victory, the campaign had been marked by bitter rows over its conduct between Norman Tebbit and Lord (David) Young of Graffham, and staff morale was low. The promotion of an obscure junior minister – Brooke was also made paymaster-general, a post his father had once held – rather than a more senior party figure seemed a strange one in the circumstances, but Brooke’s easy manner and business acumen helped to steady the organisation. As a pro-European he was unhappy with the increasingly Eurosceptic party’s campaign against “A Diet of Brussels” on its posters during the 1989 European elections, though he was not influential enough to change it.

Of his infamous appearance on the Gay Byrne show in Dublin he said: ‘My defences were down … it was patently an error.’ Photograph: David Fowler/Alamy Soon moved after the elections he became Northern Ireland secretary – a promotion also greeted with scepticism on both sides of the Irish Sea. Unionists discounted the fact that Brooke came from an old Anglo-Irish family – he claimed to be three-eighths Irish – and grew alarmed when he soon suggested in an interview that Sinn Féin might be included in future negotiations if the Provisional IRA declared a ceasefire. He would later, out of office, speak in a BBC interview of Gerry Adams being a brave man to have entered negotiations. In deep secrecy, in 1990 “deniable” talks got under way between an MI5 agent and Republican paramilitaries. Much more publicly but slowly, Brooke headed moves to bring constitutional parties and the Irish Republic’s government towards negotiations: “talks about talks”, the so-called Brooke initiative. The Economist magazine remarked: “Mr Brooke has done more in a few months than many of his predecessors managed in several years and nobody expected it of him.” The IRA’s campaign nevertheless continued, as did that of the Loyalists who, with the connivance of the police, shot the Republican lawyer Pat Finucane in front of his family in 1989. After the Late Late show debacle, it was always likely that Brooke would be moved, though Major’s excuse that a younger man needed promotion was undermined by the fact that he was succeeded at the Northern Ireland Office by Patrick Mayhew, who was four years older. Brooke was disappointed but within six months he was back as culture secretary following Mellor’s affair with the model Antonia de Sancha. Since what started life as the Department of National Heritage had been created for Mellor, Brooke’s appointment to replace him was again a surprise, though in fact he had wide cultural interests, in pictures and books, was a regular theatregoer, spoke several languages and was a keen visitor of ancient churches. The department – in which he had to deal with numerous arts organisations seeking government funding – had its pitfalls. There was the fire at Windsor Castle, culminating the Queen’s “annus horribilis” in December 1992, after which he and the prime minister promised government funding for the repairs before being forced to backtrack in the face of public opposition. Another lapse of judgment occurred with the announcement that the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war would be celebrated by a family fun day in Green Park (though this was the wheeze of a junior minister) from which Brooke also had to retreat following criticism from veterans. However, he was successful in protecting the BBC licence fee from perennial demands that it should be replaced by a subscription service. In 1994, Brooke was again replaced and returned to the backbenches. He rather hoped to become the Commons speaker but this was thwarted by the election of Betty Boothroyd. He accepted her appointment with good grace and remained in the Commons for another seven years before stepping down and becoming a life peer. He also served in the Lords as chair of the Association of Conservative Peers. Brooke’s list of outside interests accumulated: he became a trustee of the Wordsworth Trust, supervising Dove Cottage, of the Churches Conservation Trust and of the Cusichaca project which seeks to preserve the Inca remains in Peru – his first wife had grown up there – and of various other arts projects, some in Wiltshire, where he had his home. In 1992 he was appointed Companion of Honour. Brooke married Joan Smith in 1964, and they had four sons, one of whom died in infancy. She died suddenly in 1985 after a routine hospital operation went wrong. In 1991, he married Lindsay Allinson, who was a Conservative Party election agent. She survives him, along with his sons, Jonathan, Daniel and Sebastian; sisters Honor and Margaret; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. • Peter Leonard Brooke, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, born 3 March 1934; died 13 May 2023</body>

    <head>School caterers in England and Wales ‘facing a precipice’ as costs rise</head>
    <body>Some schools are substituting lentils and beans for meat while others are cutting pupils’ portion sizes because of rising costs, food shortages and problematic supply chains, according to caterers, who say they are “facing a precipice”. In a survey by LACA – the School Food People, which represents caterers in England and Wales, 77% of respondents said they had changed their menus because of supply issues, while 26% had cut back on choice. Caterers reported being “increasingly concerned” about the future of the school meals service, particularly in rural areas, where rising transport costs have created additional problems. They also warned of shortages of basic items including eggs, tomatoes, fish, chicken and cucumbers. LACA’s 900 members include single-site providers, local authorities and large commercial caterers who provide services across more than 11,500 schools and feed 1.1 million pupils a day. Almost all of the 87 respondents (98%) said they were facing food shortages and seeing substitutions in their supply chains. Three out of 10 (29%) had substituted meat with cheaper alternatives such as lentils and pulses, and 8% had reduced portion sizes because of increased costs. Almost two in five (38%) had reduced menu options because of costs, while one in 10 had reduced the nutritional value of their meals. Almost a fifth (19%) of respondents were concerned that meeting school food standards in full was becoming increasingly challenging, up from one in eight (12.5%) reported to LACA in November. In addition, 17% had considered moving from hot food to a cold service to help reduce energy costs, up from 4% in November. “We are trying so hard to met the standards. It is incredibly difficult and it pains me to say that we cannot currently meet all of the standards every day,” one caterer told LACA. Another said: “No profit at all on school meals now – it’s not sustainable.” Caterers said they had seen a 20% increase in the cost of food since November, “on top of the additional rises reported last year of over 50%”, LACA reported. To save costs, 13% had switched from British meat to meat from abroad, and a further 28% were considering doing so. The findings are from the latest in LACA’s quarterly cost of living surveys, which began last March and have documented the challenges facing the school food industry. It found that the price of a school meal had increased on average by 6.1% since March 2020, and further increases were expected from September. LACA’s chair, Brad Pearce, said: “This survey highlights why funding for school meals must urgently increase if caterers are to continue delivering a hot, healthy and nutritious provision to children. “The current allocated funding of £2.41 for universal infant free school meals and £2.47 for benefit-based free school meals is falling short. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that if costs had kept up with inflation, the price of a school meal would be £2.87. Action by government is needed now.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “To recognise the pressures facing schools, in April 2022 we announced an £18m increase in funding for universal infant free school meals to support with costs around food, transport and staff wages.”</body>

    <head>Replacing sugar with sweeteners does not affect weight control in long term, WHO says</head>
    <body>Replacing sugar with sweeteners does not help people manage their weight in the long term, the World Health Organization has said. Long-term use of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) could raise the risk of various health problems including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, they added. Substances such as aspartame, stevia and saccharin, are commonly added to products by the food and drink industry, not least because of a drive to cut the sugar content of such items. However a systematic review of the evidence by the WHO suggests the approach may not be such a sweet deal. “Replacing free sugars with NSS does not help with weight control in the long term. People need to consider other ways to reduce free sugars intake, such as consuming food with naturally occurring sugars, like fruit, or unsweetened food and beverages,” said Dr Francesco Branca, WHO director for nutrition and food safety. “NSS are not essential dietary factors and have no nutritional value. People should reduce the sweetness of the diet altogether, starting early in life, to improve their health.” Dr Ian Johnson, nutrition researcher and emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute, said the recommendation should not be interpreted as an indication that sugar intake has no relevance to weight control. “A better alternative to the use of artificial sweeteners is to reduce consumption of manufactured products containing free sugars, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, to use raw or lightly processed fruit as a source of sweetness, and perhaps, in the longer term, to try to reduce one’s overall taste for sweetness,” he said. The new guideline follows a 2019 review by Cochrane – an international non-profit research group – that concluded there was no evidence for health benefits from NSSs while potential harms could not be excluded. However the experts involved in that review stressed the evidence analysed was not very robust – a concern also flagged for the WHO work. Related: The price of ‘sugar free’: are sweeteners as harmless as we thought? The WHO recommendation that NSS not be used as a means of achieving weight control or chronic disease prevention only applies to people without pre-existing diabetes, and is conditional because of a lack of certainty around the evidence between NSS and disease outcomes. Among the review’s limitations, Prof Nita Forouhi, MRC epidemiology unit, University of Cambridge, noted the short duration of most of the randomised control trials and low certainty of the evidence, most of the trials did not explicitly compare the replacement of sugar consumption with NSS, and NSS were considered as a class of compounds collectively without distinguishing between individual types. Forouhi said the conditional nature of the recommendation meant context and country specific policy decisions might be needed. “The role of non-sugar sweeteners as a way to reduce calories in the short-term is, however, supported by evidence – so using sweeteners can be part of interventions to manage weight in the short term,” she said. A spokesperson for the International Sweeteners Association said: “Low/no calorie sweeteners are one of the most thoroughly researched ingredients in the world and continue to be a helpful tool to manage obesity, diabetes and dental diseases. They offer consumers an alternative to reduce sugar and calorie intake with the sweet taste they know and expect.”</body>

    <head>Turkey election goes to runoff after Erdoğan takes first-round lead</head>
    <body>Turkey’s presidential election is going to a runoff after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan comfortably outperformed his chief rival, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, but just failed to clear the 50% vote threshold needed to avoid a second round. The 69-year-old conservative incumbent confounded pollsters’ predictions and his secular rival to win the first round of the country’s pivotal election, scoring 49.51% against Kılıçdaroğlu’s 44.88%, with a small number of overseas votes left to count. The runoff will take place on 28 May. Polls and observers had predicted an advantage if not an outright victory for Kılıçdaroğlu, 74, but as the final results from Sunday’s election were announced it became clear Erdoğan had defied expectations, seizing a majority – along with his nationalist coalition partners – in parliament and forcing a second-round vote in the presidential race. As the opposition scrambled to process what for them was a long and difficult evening in which they repeatedly claimed to be in the lead, the six-party coalition that had banded together in the hope of defeating Erdoğan appeared ready to fracture as they attempted to regain momentum before the runoff. Kılıçdaroğlu in particular was under pressure to adapt quickly to a nationalist groundswell of support signalling a further rightward shift in Turkey’s politics, which granted the ultranationalist presidential candidate Sinan Oğan 5% of the overall vote and empowered far-right parties in parliament. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu makes a statement to the press. Photograph: Dia/Getty A voting observation mission by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said political participation was high and voters had a choice between true political alternatives, “but the incumbent president and the ruling parties enjoyed an unjustified advantage, including through biased media coverage”. They added: “The campaign itself was competitive and largely free for most contestants but characterised by intense polarisation, and marred by harsh rhetoric, instances of misuse of administrative resources, and the pressure and intimidation faced by one opposition party.” Kılıçdaroğlu tried to appear defiant, releasing a short video that showed him passionately banging on a table and declaring “Here I am! Here I am! You’re here too. I swear to God I will fight till the end. Here I am!” Investors appeared less convinced, with the main Turkish stock exchange index down 2.5% after initially falling more than 6%. The opposition had expected to benefit from voter anger at Turkey’s economic crisis, after Erdoğan’s unorthodox policy of low interest rates sent the lira plunging and inflation soaring to hit 85% last year. A slow government response to earthquakes that killed 50,000 people across Turkey and Syria in February had also been expected to sway voters. But Erdoğan successfully rallied conservative support and is thought likely to extend his rule into a third decade. “The president is likely to ride his strong approval rating, surprise win in parliament, and incumbency advantages to secure re-election,” said Emre Peker, of the Eurasia Group consultancy. The main opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) attempted to save face despite unexpectedly falling behind in both the parliamentary and presidential votes. “The elections held yesterday showed that Erdoğan could not get a vote of confidence from our nation,” said a CHP spokesperson, Faik Öztrak. “For the next 15 days, we will do everything to bring rights, law and justice to this country. The will of our nation is above everything else. We will definitely win in the second round. [Our] alliance will take the lead. We will win. The winner will be democracy, the winner will be Turkey.” Amid questions about why Kılıçdaroğlu and his coalition did not manage to secure a majority in parliament or successfully capitalise on voters’ criticisms of Erdoğan, observers noted a rightward shift in Turkish politics. “During the campaign period there was a lot of speculation about an opposition undercurrent that might push Kılıçdaroğlu above the 50% mark in the first round. We now know that the colour of this undercurrent was conservative and nationalist. Very few opinion polls had captured that,” said Berkay Mandıracı, of the International Crisis Group. Related: Could a diverse alliance end Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s authoritarian rule? Oğan, an ultranationalist who ostensibly ran as a spoiler candidate to promote his fiercely anti-refugee policies despite Kılıçdaroğlu also pledging to deport Syrian and Afghan refugees, was triumphant after the vote. “We said the same thing from day one … Turkish nationalists will be the determinant of this election, the elections will go to the second round,” he told Turkey’s Fox TV. He added: “We are little short of our expectations. Our expectation was at least 11-12% [of the vote.] But if we were not in the election, President Erdoğan would be giving a balcony speech right now.” Oğan’s voters were left weighing up what to do in the second round of voting. Mert, 29, who defined himself as “a nationalist but not racist,” while boxing up cakes in a bakery in Erdoğan’s home district of Kasımpaşa, said he was unconvinced by both Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu. “Erdoğan let in refugees,” he said. “But the biggest problem with Kılıçdaroğlu is that he stands with the HDP [the majority Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic party, whose leader Selahattin Demirtaş backed Kılıçdaroğlu from prison].” Kılıçdaroğlu’s unusual outreach to leftwing Kurdish voters as part of a broad alliance vying to defeat Erdoğan after two decades in office saw him given a warm welcome in majority-Kurdish towns in eastern Turkey, and bolstered his vote in the presidential election. “To secure a victory in the runoff, Kılıçdaroğlu will need to find a way to appeal to ultranationalist voters while at the same time maintaining his support among HDP-supporting Kurds. This is no easy stretch,” said Mandıracı. Oğan told Reuters on Monday that he would only consider backing Kılıçdaroğlu if no concessions were made to the HDP. Critics of Kılıçdaroğlu also quickly came to the fore, loudly suggesting that he should resign as leader before the second round. “He should resign today. He says that Erdoğan lost votes. We are the losers. He should immediately resign from the CHP presidency,” said Mehmet Sevigen, a former CHP official. Members of Kılıçdaroğlu’s six-party opposition coalition largely fell silent the day after the vote as they struggled to regroup, contemplating the challenge of motivating their supporters to turn out a second time amid the heavy setback. “Today a deep sense of defeat and disappointment prevails among opposition voters. Mobilising them again will be a challenge for Kılıçdaroğlu and his alliance partners,” Mandıracı said. “For now at least, the momentum appears to be in Erdoğan’s favour.”</body>

    <head>GMC to investigate ‘stalker’ doctor who shared patient’s records</head>
    <body>The UK medical regulator has launched an investigation into a “stalker” doctor who accessed intimate details of the health history of a woman who had begun dating the doctor’s ex-boyfriend. The General Medical Council (GMC) is investigating whether the doctor – a consultant at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge – breached their professional, ethical and legal duties to protect the woman’s personal information. The victim has given the watchdog a statement detailing the consultant’s repeated violations of her medical records and documentation that shows what she did. The GMC declined to comment because it has not yet decided to open a formal disciplinary case against the consultant, who could face serious sanctions including a ban on working as a doctor. One of the GMC’s investigative officers is examining the victim’s claims and collecting evidence. The GMC did set out the key areas of Good Medical Practice, its manual on doctor’s ethical duties, and its rules on confidentiality that the consultant may have breached. The Guardian revealed on Sunday how the doctor had looked at the victim’s hospital and GP records seven times last August and September, in the early stages of the woman’s relationship with a man the consultant had been involved with for several years. The victim said she felt “anger, fear, shock and horror” when an audit by Addenbrooke’s of who had accessed her records showed that the doctor – who was not involved in her care – had spent time reading them, including several times while on holiday. The consultant shared some of the information on the victim and her family that she had gleaned with the ex-boyfriend and lied about where she had obtained it, insisting it was from friends, members of her choir, and gossip. Cambridge university hospitals NHS trust, which runs Addenbrooke’s, has acknowledged the multiple breaches and apologised to the woman. It said the doctor’s behaviour “was fully investigated in line with the trust’s disciplinary policy and appropriate action taken”. But it declined to say what if any sanctions had been taken, citing the doctor’s right to privacy. The Guardian has decided not to name the doctor or the victim. The consultant used Epic, the Addenbrooke’s hospital records system, to access the woman’s GP records, which contained highly sensitive details about a family tragedy and how it had affected the victim and her children. The victim said: “My referral to the GMC was based on my concern that a doctor had illegitimately accessed my data and used it in a destructive or malicious manner. In doing so, she had broken the law, as well as her ethical, professional and contractual obligations. I was also concerned by her behaviour and that this undermined her fitness to practise as a doctor.” The GMC rules that the consultant may have broken include those specifying that: “Doctors are under both ethical and legal duties to protect patients’ personal information from improper disclosure.” “Good doctors work in partnership with patients and respect their rights to privacy and dignity.” “You must make sure that your conduct justifies your patients’ trust in you and the public’s trust in the profession.” Doctors can access patients’ medical records but need a legitimate reason for doing so. Under NHS data governance procedures, when seeking access, they have to assure their employer that they have a valid clinical interest in doing so, usually because they are part of a team treating the patient. Sam Smith, of the health data experts MedConfidential, said the NHS had no idea how often a doctor accessed a patient’s medical records without due cause, as in this case. Patients rarely complain because they have no way of knowing it has happened unless someone tells them, and the NHS has no way of establishing whether staff who have looked at records did so for the proper reasons.</body>

    <head>Braverman urges Tories to avoid Trumpism, saying ‘events in US in recent years’ should be warning to conservatives – as it happened</head>
    <body>6.03pm BST Early evening summary Suella Braverman has railed against “experts and elites” and what she called the divisive politics of identity, in a highly partisan speech that is likely to be viewed as setting out ideas for a post-election Conservative leadership bid. Braverman was speaking at a conference organised by a rightwing American thinktank which also heard a speech from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory former business secretary, who described the photo ID voting law introduced by the government when he was in cabinet as gerrymandering. (See 11.50am.) Commenting on the conference proceedings, Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: The true face of the modern Tory party has revealed itself today. Rather than focus on the cost of living crisis, the state of the NHS, crime or house building, Tory MPs and cabinet ministers have instead chosen to hold a carnival of conspiracy theory and self-pity. Ukraine has dropped its request for British fighter jets to help in its war against Russia, with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, making it clear during a visit to the UK that he was focusing on American F-16s instead. Keir Starmer has said it “feels wrong” not to allow EU citizens who live and pay tax in the UK not to have the right to vote in general elections. See 11.04am for a full summary of his LBC phone-in. Nicola Sturgeon says the furious backlash to Scottish government plans to pilot jury-less trials for rape cases is the latest example of the polarisation of politics that contributed to her resignation as first minister.

Photograph: Simon Dawson/ No 10 Updated at 6.04pm BST 5.52pm BST In the Commons MPs are debating the second reading of the victims and prisoners bill. Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, called it a wasted opportunity. He said: It’s eight years and eight justice secretaries since the Conservatives first promised legislation to support victims. For all that time, Labour has been telling them to act. Now, finally, we have a bill, but I am afraid it is a wasted opportunity because it fails in so many ways to rebalance the scales of justice and make a real difference for victims. The bill lets down rape survivors. It offers no specialist legal advice or advocacy that will help them to navigate the justice system. 5.32pm BST Peers inflict defeat on government on retained EU law bill Peers have inflicted a defeat on the government over the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. Last week Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, announced a big U-turn on this bill when she shelved the plan for it to include an automatic sunset clause making all retained EU regulations obsolete at the end of the year, unless ministers decide to retain or revise them. Instead she published a list of around 600 EU laws that would definitely lapse at the end of 2023. Under an amendment tabled by the crossbencher, Lord Hope, and passed by 245 votes to 154 – a majority of 91 – this list will have to be referred to a joint committee of MPs and peers so that, if changes to the law are significant, parliament can express a view. Govt defeat on #retainedeulawbill as peers vote 245-154 FOR XB Lord Hope - led amendt (2) requiring the schedule of retained EU law to be revoked is referred to joint committee of @UKHouseofLords &amp; @HouseofCommons for sifting, so @UKParliament can express own view on changes — LabourLordsUK (@LabourLordsUK) May 15, 2023 5.15pm BST Labour should repeal photo ID voting law, says Sadiq Khan London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has said that a Labour government should repeal the law requiring voters to have photo ID. Khan was speaking at an event on housing, which took place after Keir Starmer told LBC this morning that he would review the law before deciding whether or not to keep it. (See 11.04am.) Speaking today in east London, Khan was explicit about his opposition to the measure. He said: We know that some seats from won and lost by a handful of votes. So literally, there are some seats that have been won or lost because of the government’s legislation on photo ID no evidence, I think this is a deliberate Conservative tactic to suppress the vote. We don’t know by the way, how many people didn’t bother going to vote because they didn’t have photo ID. All we have are figures for people turned away at the polling stations. I think yes ... what a new Labour government should be doing is repealing that part of the act. Khan also said there was no evidence of the sort of widespread impersonation of voters which defenders of the measures said they wanted to combat. 5.08pm BST No 10 rejects Rees-Mogg&apos;s claim that photo ID voting law is gerrymandering Downing Street has rejected Jacob Rees-Mogg’s claim that the law requiring voters to have photo ID amounted to gerrymandering. (See 11.50am.) Asked about the claim, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the afternoon lobby briefing: We’ve talked at length about the rationale for the introduction of voter ID and the importance of guarding against the possibility of election fraud. He highlighted the requirement for voters in Northern Ireland to have to show photo ID since 2003 and said similar schemes were in place in “many other European countries”. Asked whether he saying “no” to the question of gerrymandering being a factor in its introduction, the spokesman said: “[That is] also a shorter way of saying so.” 4.58pm BST Braverman urges Tories to avoid Trumpism, saying &apos;events in US in recent years&apos; should be warning to conservatives Although Suella Braverman delivered a rightwing speech to a rightwing audience this afternoon, she did include a coda suggesting that it would be a mistake for the Tories to go too far in a Trumpite direction. She was speaking at a conference run by the Edmund Burke Foundation promoting national conservatism, a brand of conservatism with a much bigger focus on nationalism and traditonal thinking than you find in Britain’s One Nation tradition. It is not explicitly Trumpite, but Trump supporters would be comfortable with much of the national conservatism agenda. In her speech Braverman said national conservatism had “a role to play” in the conservative movement. But she went on: Having observed events in the US in recent years, I do want to sound a note of caution. One way that we Conservatives must distinguish ourselves from the left is by not devouring ourselves through fratricide. Free market conservatism is not the enemy of national conservatism. Conservatism must never abandon markets, the rule of law, or a belief in the power of capitalism to lift people out of poverty. At the same time conservatism should never abandon people or communities to market forces. To the extent that those two forces are in tension, it is incumbent on conservatives to find a prudent balance, not pick a side and start shooting. Similarly, conservatism can never mean isolationism. Freeing ourselves from a blinkered sense that the UK’s destiny is as a predominantly European-facing country - rather than a truly global one with ties to the Commonwealth, America, and elsewhere - has been one of the best political developments in recent decades. Braverman was clearly referring to Donald Trump and his brand of national populism, even though she did not mention him by name. 4.32pm BST Sadiq Khan says he is lobbying Labour to commit to giving London mayor power to impose rent freezes Sadiq Khan is lobbying Labour colleagues to commit to rent freezes if they win power – a demand which has gone unheeded from the current Tory government. London’s mayor heralded a “big bang in an affordable housing revolution” as he announced that a record number of affordable homes are being built in the city. In a speech at a showcase new housing development, Khan said that a “record number” of 25,000 affordable homes had been started last year and that he had surpassed his 2015 promise to begin building 116,000 by 2023. The housing crisis in London was “turbo-charging inequalities in wealth, health and happiness”, he said. As mayor, I don’t want to see London become a playground for the rich - I’m determined to build a London for everyone. However, the issue of rental freezes is emerging as a point of debate within Labour, which has stopped short of backing what Khan and others are pushing for. The Scottish government announced a rent freeze for public and private properties last year after a similar proposal by Scottish Labour, to freeze rents for two years until rent controls are introduced in 2024, was voted down by SNP and Scottish Green MSPs. Speaking after his speech, Khan told reporters: As a Labour member, and Labour mayor I am are lobbying colleagues at the national policy forum and shadow cabinet to bring in policies in the manifesto to look at look at the issue of rent freezes. The reality is, even if we massively increase in supply of new homes in London and massively increase the supply of council homes in London and across the country, there will still be record numbers of people renting in the private sector and for those 2.7 million people in London we need to improve the protection for those renting. Sources close to Khan said he was not asking for rent controls nationally but for powers to have a rent controls commission in London where there are “exceptional issues” with sky high rents. This was in his 2021 mayoral election manifesto. Sadiq Khan. Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images Updated at 4.45pm BST 4.22pm BST How Suella Braverman defines conservatism - extracts from her speech Most of the Suella Braverman speech was about conservatism, and how she defines it. She started with a long passage about how both her parents came to the UK as immigrants (the sort of family, hard work success story that is de rigueur in a speech to a US political convention), and she said they admired Britain’s values, which she said were conservative values. Then she set out to explain what conservatism (mostly she uses the small-c version) means to her. This is why it is hard not to read the speech as putting down a marker for a leadership contest. Other than implying that immigration policy is too lax (see 12.54pm), she was not disloyal to Rishi Sunak, and he would probably agree with most of what she said about conservatism. But the very fact that she was courting the party so assiduously (Tory members will love it) makes it a leadership play. She defined conservatism as being optimistic about the future, abhoring political correctness and radical ideology, believing in and loving your country, understanding the importance of borders and national identity, and being pro-family. Here are some of the key quotes. Braverman, the home secretary, said conservatives should be sceptical of experts and elites. She said: Conservatives prize experience, judgement, and wisdom. I think William F Buckley Jr’s quip, that “I would rather be governed by the first 2,000 people in the telephone directory than by the Harvard University Faculty” captures the essence of it. We are sceptical of self-appointed gurus, experts, and elites who think they know best what is in the public’s interest, even when that public is quite certain that they need something different from what those experts are proposing. She said focusing on conventional measures of diversity was “myopic”, and likely to foster grievance. She said: Measuring diversity only on the basis of skin colour, sex, and sexuality is mind-bogglingly myopic. Identity politics is the politics of grievance and division – it is illiberal and incompatible with social cohesion. It defines people based on their external characteristics rather than on the content of their character or their natural abilities. It then divides people into groups, and places those groups on a hierarchy of grievance, explaining any disparity of outcome through the prism of structural discrimination. She claimed the left was obsessed with eradicating inequality, at the expense of liberty. She said: I understand that the goal of conservatism is to protect fundamental rights, enhance the dignity and potential of human beings, and in so doing forge healthy communities that make possible extraordinary collective achievements. The left on the other hand sees the purpose of politics as to eradicate the existence of inequality, even if that comes at the expense of individual liberty and human flourishing. And she claimed that state intervention to ensure “equality of outcomes” was dangerous. She said: We want to expand opportunity, passionately so, but the idea that any true equality of opportunity is structurally impossible, and so instead the state must intervene to ensure equality of outcomes, is a dangerous one. She said that, although many people on the left loved their country, love of country was a “necessary, possibly the necessary condition, of being a conservative”. She went on: The truth is that large parts of the contemporary left are ashamed of our history and embarrassed by the sentiments and desires expressed by the British public. She claimed the left needed to make people ashamed of Britain’s past. She said: I think the left can only sell its vision for the future by making people feel terrible about our past. White people do not exist in a special state of sin or collective guilt. Nobody should be blamed for things that happened before they were born. The defining feature of this country’s relationship with slavery is not that we practised it, but that we led the way in abolishing it. We should be proud of who we are.

She said: The reason I’ve got I’m going to Taiwan is I have been invited by the Taiwan government. And I believe it is they who know best, they the democratically elected government of Taiwan, know best what is best for their citizens, their future. So I’m very much led by them, and encouraged that they believe my visit will help their cause in promoting freedom and democracy. As our Guardian colleague Kiran Stacey reported last week, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee launched a blistering attack on the former prime minister’s planned trip, calling it “the worst kind of Instagram diplomacy”. Alicia Kearns said she thought Truss’s trip was little more than a vanity project aimed at keeping her profile high after her brief spell as prime minister last year. 3.32pm BST Braverman says immigrants should integrate because &apos;multiculturalism as end in itself&apos; could lead to &apos;disaster&apos; Immigration turned out to be a relatively small portion of Suella Braverman’s speech to the NatCon conference, but in the passage that did cover it she made two main arguments. Here are excerpts. Braverman, the home secretary, said legal migration numbers had to come down. She implied they were unsustainable at their current level. She said: While illegal migration is rightly our priority given the acute challenges we face in the Channel, we must not lose sight of the importance of controlling legal migration too. I voted and campaigned for Brexit – indeed I’m a proud Spartan - because I wanted Britain to control migration. So that we all have a say on what works for our country. High skilled workers support economic growth. And where the labour market has acute or structural shortages, as with the NHS, it is of course right that we should have an immigration system agile enough to plug those shortages. But we need to get overall immigration numbers down. And we mustn’t forget how to do things for ourselves. There is no good reason why can’t train up enough truck drivers, butchers, fruit pickers, builders, and welders … It’s not xenophobic to say that mass and rapid migration is unsustainable in terms of housing supply, public services and community relations. She said the immigrants should integrate, because “multiculturalism as an end in itself” could lead to “disaster”. She said: My parents came here through legal and controlled migration. They spoke the language. They threw themselves into the community, embraced British values. When they arrived they signed up to be part of our shared project because the UK meant something distinct. Integration was part of the quid pro quo … The unexamined drive towards multiculturalism as an end in itself, combined with identity politics, is a recipe for communal disaster. We cannot have immigration without integration. And if we lack the confidence to promote our culture, defend our values, and venerate our past, then we have nothing to integrate people into. We have a nation, and more than that, a national character to conserve. We are not unique in wanting to conserve it. Other leaders in countries such as Italy, Denmark, Poland, Greece, and Austria are increasingly seeing things the same way. Conservatism is order or it is nothing. Most of the speech was about Braverman’s view of Conservatism. I will post on that shortly. Suella Braverman giving her speech to the NatCon conference. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images Updated at 4.08pm BST 3.01pm BST Liz Truss confirms she has &apos;no ambitions&apos; to be PM again Liz Truss has said she has “no ambitions” to be prime minister again and is enjoying the “freedom to achieve and do things” she wasn’t able to do in government – such as her plans to visit Taiwan this week. Speaking two days before she makes a controversial visit to the island, which has been lambasted by one influential Tory MP as “the worst of Instagram diplomacy”, Truss called for a toughening of the west’s approach to China. She said that she stood by her proposals, later scrapped by her Downing Street successor, Rishi Sunak, to officially redesignate China in official parlance and documents as a “threat” to the UK. Speaking at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, she said: I think they’re the largest threat that we face to the free world. I believe that we all need to wake up to the threat China presents, that we need to make sure that Taiwan is able to defend itself. Asked directly if she had any ambitions to return as prime minister in the future, she replied: I have no ambitions to become prime minister again. What I care about is making sure that freedom and democracy prevail across the world, and advocating for an economic Nato which I believe will help achieve that. I care about the British economy becoming successful, and our country growing. Updated at 3.06pm BST 2.43pm BST Peter Walker has more from the Suella Braverman speech. Braverman says her parents&apos; conservative philosophy was &quot;of optimism, pride, national unity, aspiration, and realism&quot;. She adds: &quot;The left’s is a politics of pessimism, guilt, national division, resentment, and utopianism.&quot; — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Braverman: &quot;We are sceptical of self-appointed gurus, experts, and elites who think they know best what is in the public’s interest, even when that public is quite certain that they need something different from what those experts are proposing.&quot; — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 If you haven&apos;t already got the point, this is *very* much the setting out by Braverman of a philosophical stall for a (probably) post-election leadership bid. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Braverman: &quot;The ethnicity of grooming gang perpetrators is the sort of fact that has become unfashionable in some quarters. Much like the fact that 100% of women do not have a penis.&quot; — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Again, not a surprise, but the eventual Braverman Tory leadership bid will come v much from the culture war end of things. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 To succeed electorally, Conservatives from the Braverman culture war wing need to persuade voters that Labour are these history-hating, statue-toppling, woke types described at this NatCon conference. I would suspect that most voters might look at Keir Starmer and think: really? — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Updated at 2.43pm BST 2.34pm BST Extinction Rebellion, the direct action group trying to get governments to respond to the climate crisis, has put out a statement saying its activists disrupted Jacob Rees-Mogg and Suella Braverman at the NatCon conference. It says they wanted to call out “fascist ideologies” backed by Tory participants. In its news release it says: National Conservatism promotes nationalism, scapegoating, ‘traditional family values’, media control, rightwing economics, profiting from the obscene dividends of corporations while waging austerity against the vulnerable and defunding education, health and welfare provision. They ignore the immediate peril of the climate emergency to millions of humans and myriad species. NatCon sees the courts and police as the means of suppressing peaceful protest and criminalising asylum seekers and trade unionists … Following the implementation of the controversial Public Order Act ahead of the king’s coronation, [Extinction Rebellion] is calling out concerns of increasingly fascist ideals being adopted by senior members of the Conservative party. Even the UN has criticised the new law as ‘incompatible with the UK’s international human rights obligations regarding people’s rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association’. Updated at 2.53pm BST 2.22pm BST After Suella Braverman was interrupted by protesters, she dismissed them with a joke, saying: “It’s audition day for the shadow cabinet.” As Lewis Goodall points out, there is a lot more truth in what she said than she probably intended. (See 8.42am.) It was a good line but one with more meaning than she intended. So much of what she’s doing right now, so much of these conferences, are with half an eye on the heart and soul of an opposition Conservative Party. — Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) May 15, 2023 2.18pm BST BBC News and Sky are not covering the Suella Braverman speech live. Apparently the conference organisers were not covering it live. But Peter Walker is covering it on Twitter, which is the next best thing. Braverman&apos;s speech begins with the story of her father&apos;s arrival in the UK. We are told her speech will be personal, and not primarily policy-based. You might even call it &quot;wide ranging&quot; - the traditional code for someone with leadership ambitions on their mind. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Braverman also outlines her mother&apos;s arrival in the UK from Mauritius. While the legal context is obviously different*, there is an undeniable paradox in someone of her policy views explaining the story of her parents as, essentially, a refugee and an economic migrant. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 And this is from Bloomberg’s Kitty Donaldson. This feels very much like an audition speech for Tory leader. We&apos;re nine minutes in and still on her family background. — Kitty Donaldson (@kitty_donaldson) May 15, 2023 2.11pm BST Suella Braverman interrupted by two protesters as she begins speech to NatCon conference Suella Braverman’s speech to the NacCon conference has been interrupted by two protesters, Peter Walker reports.

(and ignorant about electoral behaviour, photo ID holding, and laws of unintended consequences). https://t.co/NCTzDRASpE — Jane Green (@ProfJaneGreen) May 15, 2023 2.01pm BST Liz Truss, the Tory former PM, is speaking now at the Copenhagan Democracy Summit. There is a live feed here. She says she is going to Taiwan to give a speech later this week because she has been invited by the Taiwanese government. They know best what is good for their country, she says. She says Taiwan is at the frontline between democracy and autocracy. Asked if she expects China to respond to her visit in the way it responded to Nancy Pelosi visiting when she was speaker of the House of Representatives (the Chinese mobilising warships and fighter jets), she said China wants to make it unacceptable for people to engage with Taiwan, or visit it. That should not be allowed, she says. Updated at 3.43pm BST 1.30pm BST At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said Rishi Sunak did not favour allowing EU nationals or 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in general elections, as Labour is considering. (See 11.04am.) The spokesperson said: The right to vote in parliamentary elections and choose the next UK government is restricted to British citizens, citizens of those with the closest historical links to our country. That’s the position of the vast majority of nations across the world. On allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote, the spokesperson said that 18 “is recognised as the age at which one becomes an adult – full citizenship rights, drinking, smoking, voting are only gained at adulthood”. “We have no plans to change the national voting age,” the spokesperson said. In an article in the Financial Times Jim Pickard says Keir Starmer is actually going back on a proposal he made in 2020 for all EU nationals to be allowed to vote in general elections. Labour is now only proposing to extend the franchise to EU nationals who have been resident in the UK for some time, Pickard says. Updated at 1.39pm BST 1.01pm BST This is from Chris Rennard, a Lib Dem peer and former chief executive of the party, on Jacob Rees-Mogg saying the photo ID law amounted to gerrymandering. (See 11.50am.) A confession from @Jacob_Rees_Mogg that the photo ID scheme to vote in elections was deliberate “gerrymandering” by the Conservatives, what we in @LibDemLords @LibDems said all along.

He said Braverman would be speaking on behalf of the government when she delivered her speech this afternoon. Asked if Sunak agreed that more Britons should be trained to drive HGVs, work as butchers or pick fruit, the spokesperson replied: We have said before we want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on overseas labour as part of building a high-wage and high-skilled economy and we’re supporting those industries to do that. The spokesperson also said Sunak did want to reduce the level of net immigration. But he would not say when this would happen, or what Sunak considered to be the “baseline” level of immigration. Asked if Sunak was confident he could cut immigration while growing the economy (because economists, including the OBR, believe immigration is necessary for growth), the spokesperson replied: “Both those things remain government commitments, to grow the economy, to reduce overall [immigration] numbers”. The spokesperson would not say whether the commitment to reduce immigration meant the government would stop adding news jobs to the shortage occupations list (making it easier for foreign workers in those jobs to get visas to work in the UK). He said he would not get into the process for those decisons. And when it was put to him that, if the government wants more Britons to work, for example, picking fruit, it should just tell employers to pay more, the spokesperson replied: We are not in the business of telling private sector companies what are the right salaries to pay their staff. That is for them to decide. Updated at 12.57pm BST 12.23pm BST This is from Gavin Barwell, the Tory peer and chief of staff to Theresa May when she was prime minister, commenting on the Times preview of speeches being given at the NatCon conference today. The Times quotes Jacob Rees-Mogg as describing Jeremy Hunt’s plans to expand free childcare as “fundamentally anti-Conservative”. This is a good example of current intellectual confusion on the right. It starts with Braverman arguing we should get British workers to fill labour shortages then has Rees Mogg attacking help with childcare - a key way of doing that - as unconservativehttps://t.co/SfjLWgHgVT — Gavin Barwell (@GavinBarwell) May 15, 2023 12.09pm BST Zelenskiy says he and Sunak discussed &apos;jets coalition&apos; to help Ukraine Rishi Sunak and Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke to broadcasters after their talks at Chequers. Zelenskiy said they had discussed creating a “jets coalition” to help Ukraine, and he said a decision would be announced soon. He said: Today we spoke about the jets. Very important topic for us because we can’t control the sky … We want to create this jets coalition and I’m very positive with it. We spoke about it and I see that in the closest time you will hear some, I think very important decisions but we have to work a little bit more on it. Sunak confirmed that the pair had discussed how to build up Ukraine’s fighter combat capability, and he said this involved not just providing planes, but training pilots too. The UK was playing a big part in that, he went on. He said: One thing we will be doing starting actually relatively soon is training of Ukrainian pilots and that’s something we’ve discussed today and we’re ready to implement those plans in relatively short order. We will open a new UK flying school giving Ukrainian pilots the training they need to handle different types of aircraft, enabling them to better defend their citizens against Russian aggression. — UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) May 15, 2023 Sunak also said he and Zelenskiy had discussed “the security arrangements we should put in place among allied countries for Ukraine for the long term to ensure it can defend itself and provide effective deterrence against future Russian aggression”.

Rees Mogg veers off script to say it was “nonsense” and “snobbish” that the House of Lords Appointments Committee turned down Paul Dacre for a peerage. This is part of a wider attack on “the quango state”. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Rees Mogg veers into contemporary Tory politics to condemn the repeal so far of EU laws as “pathetically unambitious”, and condemn Rishi Sunak for breaking a promise. But, he adds - it is vital to support Sunak “as the alternative is far worse”. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Rees Mogg seems to argue that one of the reasons for the housing crisis is that too many planners are working from home. It is possible I misunderstood that bit. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 11.50am BST Rees-Mogg criticises photo ID voting law, calling it move to &apos;gerrymander&apos; elections Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory former business secretary, has described the requirement for people to need photo ID to be allowed to vote as “gerrymandering”. The law, which came into force following the Elections Act 2022, will apply throughout the UK at the next general election, and took effect for the first time at the English local elections earlier this month. In his speech to the NatCon conference, Rees-Mogg (who defended the legislation when he was a minister and it was going through parliament) said: Parties that try and gerrymander end up finding their clever scheme comes back to bite them, as dare I say we found by insisting on voter ID for elections. We found the people who didn’t have ID were elderly and they by and large voted Conservative, so we made it hard for our own voters and we upset a system that worked perfectly well. Ministers insist that the legislation was not introduced for party political advantage, and the Electoral Commission originally called for people to have to show ID when they voted. But the system actually chosen by the government – compulsory photo ID, with the list of acceptable photo ID cards appearing to favour pensioners – did fuel opposition suspicions that the move was, at least in part, intended to suppress the anti-Tory vote. At the weekend the Tory peer Lord Cruddas told the Conservative Democratic Organisation that Labour policies, including abolishing voter ID, would make it impossible for the Tories to win an outright majority again. That confirms that, even if photo ID was not intended as a gerrymandering measure by ministers, at least some Tories saw it as achieving that. Lord Peter Cruddas, &quot;If Labour wins they will reduce the voting age, abolish voter ID, and introduce Proportional Representation making it impossible for the Conservative party to win an outright majority in the future.&quot; Conservative Democratic Organisation pic.twitter.com/eUczNQD5sW — Farrukh (@implausibleblog) May 14, 2023 In fact, Labour is not committed to repealing the voter ID law.

Updated at 11.55am BST 11.22am BST Tory MP Miriam Cates claims falling birth rates are threat to western society The Conservative MP Miriam Cates, told the NatCon conference that falling birth rates “the one overarching threat to British conservatism and indeed the whole of western society”. First up on the actual Tory side is Miriam Cates. She begins by arguing there is one “overarching threat to Western civilisation”, even more so than climate change - not enough babies. pic.twitter.com/WXjj2QRtCF — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Arguing that economic and social policy had ceased to value having children, she said: You cannot be socially liberal and economically conservative. If you think that government and society should have nothing to say about the conditions that promote strong families, don’t be surprised if you end up with a high tax, high spend economy, with a nation of broken people dependent on the state. People do what others value and so, as conservatives, we must seek to restore the value of children in British society. For children are not an economic burden. They are not a threat to personal autonomy or a lifestyle choice. Children are a joy and a blessing, they are the symptom and the cause of a society that has hope. She also claimed “cultural Marxism” was “destroying our children’s souls”. She said: [Hope for the future] is sadly diminishing in so many of our young people today, because liberal individualism has proven to be completely powerless to resist the cultural Marxism that is systematically destroying our children’s souls. When culture, schools and universities openly teach that our country is racist, our heroes are villains, humanity is killing the earth, you are what you desire, diversity is theology, boundaries are tyranny and self-restraint is oppression, is it any wonder that mental health conditions, self-harm and suicide, and epidemic levels of anxiety and confusion characterise the emerging generation? My colleague Peter Walker, who was listening, says “cultural Marxism” is a conspiracy theory. Cates says UK children are being indoctrinated with “cultural Marxism”. Your regular reminder that this is a conspiracy theory often associated with the far right and antisemitism, eg https://t.co/c5TOHE0liQ — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 But he says in other respects the speech was intellectually coherent. Beyond the reference to Cultural Marxism, this is quite an interesting political speech in that, agree or not, it is intellectually coherent and knows what it wants to say. For some people - as seen eg in Hungary &amp; Italy - these ideas can be appealing. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Updated at 11.34am BST 11.04am BST Summary of key points from Starmer&apos;s LBC phone-in Here are the main points from Keir Starmer’s LBC phone-in. Starmer confirmed that Labour is considering giving EU nationals, and 16- and 17-year-olds, the vote in general elections. Referring to media coverage of these proposals, he said this not about reversing Brexit. There would be “increasingly hysterical” headlines as the election approached, he said. (See 9.09am.) He stressed that these were just options, and that there was “no settled policy here” yet. But he implied there was a good case for both measures. On EU nationals, he said they could vote in local elections anyway. He went on: The thinking behind it is if someone has been here, say, 10, 20, 30 years, contributing to this economy, part of our community, they ought to be able to vote. Let me bring it alive. I’ve obviously knocked a lot of doors in the last few years and you go to door sometimes in a general election election and you’re met with someone who says: ‘Look, I’m an EU citizen. I’ve been living here for 30 years. I’m married to a Brit. My kids are raised and brought up here. They’re now working in the UK. I’m working in lots of community projects, etc. But I can’t vote.’ That feels wrong, and something ought to be done about it. And on 16- and 17-year-olds, he said people could have babies at this age, or join the army. He went on: It’s not such an outlandish idea, In Wales it already happens, in Scotland it already happens [in local elections, and elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliament] … These are some of the ideas that are going into the mix but they’re not policy. We’re just looking at them. But Starmer said PR was not a priority for him. Asked if that was going into the mix too, he replied: Not really … To be fair, there is a lot of people in my party who think very strongly, there is a fierce debate. Again, in Wales and Scotland you have got versions of PR. But I have been very clear. I think we are going to inherit a real mess if we are privileged enough to come into power. I know that means an incoming Labour government needs to be laser focused on fixing the things that need fixing and PR isn’t one of my priorities. I want to fix the economy, fix the NHS. He said that he would not commit to immediately repealing the Public Order Act because, now it was passed, he wanted to let it “settle in”. Asked if he would repeal it, he replied: I said as the legislation was going through that I didn’t think we needed it because we had the existing powers. Now it’s on the books I think we need to let it settle in. With public order legislation you often need a bit of time and guidance. He also said he wanted to look at the review of the impact of the photo ID voting law before deciding whether to scrap it. (See 9.33am.) Momentum, the leftwing Labour group, says Starmer should commit to repealing the Public Order Act and the photo ID voting law. The Public Order Act and Voter ID Laws are repressive Tory laws designed to stifle democracy. It beggars belief that the next Labour Government would not repeal them. pic.twitter.com/vFWkbz82sl — Momentum 🌹 (@PeoplesMomentum) May 15, 2023 Starmer refused to rule out doing a deal with the Liberal Democrats, saying that he was going for an outright majority but that “we’re going to have to see what the situation is next year”. (See 9.14am.) He described the government’s Rwanda policy for asylum seekers as “morally unacceptable”, as well as impractical. He said that, instead of giving her immigration speech today, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, should be sorting out the backlog in processing asylum claims. He said: Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is today making a speech about what she thinks ought to happen on immigration. She is the home secretary. They’ve been in power for 13 years. This is like [Mikel] Arteta … doing a speech this afternoon on what Arsenal ought to do. This is pathetic. I’d say to the home secretary: stop the speech, cancel that, get back to the office and sort out the processing of these claims. He defended his right to abandon his pledge to abolish tuition fees. When Nick Ferrari put it to him that this meant nobody could believe a word he said, Starmer replied: I don’t think that’s fair. There’s two rival arguments here. One is, if you said it, you stick to it, even when the economy is completely different. And I think you would be challenging me pretty hard to say: ‘Look, Keir, for heaven’s sake, you may have said that, you may think that, but you can’t ignore the fact that now we are in debt in a way we’ve never been since the second world war.’ So one theory of leadership is you just stick stick to your guns even when it’s pretty obvious that you can’t really deliver. I don’t actually agree with that. And I don’t think many people do. Or you say: ‘Look, there are good things I wanted to do. Looking at the situation as it now is, there’s no doubt the damage has been done to the economy by this government. We’re going to have to look again across the board and make some difficult choices.’ I think on balance the British public wants someone who says: ‘Look, I’m going to square with you and say we can’t do some of the things I wanted to do because there isn’t the money after they’ve destroyed the economy.’ He said that he was “not a status quo person” on Scotland and that he wanted to give it more power. Asked by an SNP supporter why she should vote Labour, he replied: I’m not a status quo person. I don’t think that it’s enough to say to you or anybody else in Scotland that we need to just keep things the way they are. And so I want more decision making in Scotland and want more power to Scotland, but I want Scotland to stay within a strong and changed United Kingdom.

Updated at 11.22am BST 9.46am BST My colleague Peter Walker is at the National Conservatism conference in London today. Here are some of his early tweets, which give a flavour of what it’s like. Welcome to the National Conservatism conference - aka NatCon London 2023. Despite speakers including Suella Braverman and Jacob Rees-Mogg, this isn’t a Tory party event. It’s a moveable annual gathering of low tax populist nationalism run by a US think tank. pic.twitter.com/sj93gyHKRw — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Conservative-wise, it’s particularly appealing for those on the culture war side - Miriam Cates is an early speaker today. Not packed yet, but a big queue for delegates to get accreditation. This is definitely a thing for some Tories, and could be influential post-election. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 The man sat directly behind me in 5 mins of furious splaining to his neighbour has so far argued: - the UK has been in decline since 1870. - forget a four-day week, even five days was a mistake. - “Of course, you won’t meet any British people in London these days.” — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 Crowd here is definitely on the young-ish side. To be an armchair psephologist, it’s almost as if with 70% or so of young Britons arguably on the liberal left, if you think differently this sort of Atlanticist, Reagan-tinged free-enterprise-on-steroids can be appealing. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 First speech is by James Orr from the Edmund Burke Foundation, which organises NatCon. He argues conservatism is not fulfilling basic tasks like protecting children from “indoctrination” and preserving heritage. We’re very much on immediate culture war territory here. — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 In electoral terms, it’s not very clear how beneficial a shift to the culture war right would be for the Conservatives. In my preview of NatCon, Prof Tim Bale said there was a danger that in the UK it is something of a political cul de sac. https://t.co/lh4XE1RnG1 — Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) May 15, 2023 9.37am BST Q: Do you support the extension of the Ulez low emissions zone to outer London? Starmer says there is a scheme in place to help the low-paid meet the cost. He says, when he visited a cancer research institute last week, he was shown the impact of air pollution on a lung. If we don’t use schemes like Ulez to tackle air pollution, what else can we do to protect people from air pollution, he asks. And that’s the end of the phone-in. I will post a summary soon. 9.33am BST Starmer says he wants to consider review of how photo ID voting law worked before deciding whether or not to keep it Q: Would you get rid of the photo ID law for voting? Starmer says he wants to see what the review of how it worked says. But the government should have publicised the new rule more effectively, he says. 9.30am BST Starmer says he is &apos;not status quo person&apos; on union, and favours more powers for Scotland Q: I vote for the SNP. Why should I vote Labour in the general election? To get a better Scotland in a better UK, Starmer says. He says he is “not a status quo person”. He wants more decision-making in Scotland and more power to Scotland. Updated at 9.38am BST 9.28am BST Q: What is happening with the Labour investigation into Nick Brown, the former chief whip? Starmer says an investigation is taking place. He says he cannot say any more. The process is independent, and confidential, he says. 9.27am BST Q: What do you respond to the revelation that Boris Johnson thinks Sue Gray is a psycho? Starmer says he and Johnson rarely agree on anything. He knows Gray, has worked with her and admires her, he says. He dismisses Johnson’s theory that Gray was trying to help Labour with the Partygate report as nonsense. 9.25am BST Q: Are you committed to the triple lock for pensioners? Yes, says Starmer. He says Labour would keep it. He recalls meeting a pensioners in Dewsbury who spends the day under a blanket because she is concerned about her heating bills. 9.24am BST Q: Would Labour repeal the Public Order Act? Starmer says Labour was opposed to it as it was going through. But now it has passed, he says it would be best to let it bed down and see how it operates. Q: But what are you going to change? Not the Public Order Act? Not higher corporation tax? You promised clause 4 on steroids. This is clause 4 on sleeping tablets. Starmer does not accept that. He cites his missions, and says they do amount to a “huge, bold reform”. 9.22am BST Q: Would Labour reverse the rise in corporation tax? Starmer says he does not think Labour would be able to afford that. That is why the party did not vote against the increase, he says. 9.21am BST Starmer defends his decision to change his position on tuition fees A caller says he feels let down by Starmer’s U-turn on tuition fees, which at one point he was committed to abolish? Starmer says this is a tough issue. He does wonder whether he would have gone to university if he had had to get a loan. But he says he no longer thinks a Labour government could afford to just get rid of them. Q: How can we believe anything you say? Starmer says the economy is in a different state. Leaders should change their mind when circumstances change. Q: Do you really think you would not have gone to university if you had had to get a loan? Starmer says he does not know. He says his parents were working class, and were scared of accumulating debt. Updated at 10.07am BST 9.17am BST Q: Do you agree with what the archbishop of Canterbury said about the government’s illegal migration bill? Starmer says he agrees with the archbishop that the government’s policy won’t work. Asked if he thought it was immoral too, Starmer said he thought the Rwanda policy was immoral.

Before the election, there would be “increasingly hysterical headlines”, he said. He said Labour was still considering plans to let EU nationals vote in general elections, and to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in election. He said he could see the case for both moves. Updated at 9.39am BST 9.02am BST It is a sign of how feverish things are getting in the Conservative party that Chris Mason, the BBC’s political editor, found himself being asked on the Today programme this morning if Rishi Sunak might be replaced before the general election. Mason said he did not think anyone was pushing for that. But when the rightwinger Sir John Redwood was interviewed on the programme, and asked if he supported Sunak leading the party into the general election, Redwood decline to say yes. He said he was focused on “policy not on people”. Explaining what he wanted to change, Redwood said: The current focus is on policy and I am an optimist. I think this government could do well. It could make changes for the better. I and my colleagues are desperate for it to do so. It needs to make big changes on its attitude towards Brexit, on its attitude towards economic growth and on migration. Updated at 9.16am BST 8.56am BST No 10 says UK to supply Ukraine with hundreds of long-range attack drones as Zelenskiy visits Chequers for talks with Sunak Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, is making a surprise visit to the UK today. He is holding talks with Rishi Sunak at Chequers. To coincide with his arrival, Downing Street has announced a significant increase in military support for Ukraine, including the supply of hundreds of long-range attack drones. In its news release No 10 says: Last week the UK confirmed that we have provided Storm Shadow precision missiles to Ukraine. This is the first long-range cruise missile in Ukraine’s arsenal and will be critical in helping the country defend against the relentless bombardment of their critical national infrastructure. Today the prime minister will confirm the further UK provision of hundreds of air defence missiles and further unmanned aerial systems including hundreds of new long-range attack drones with a range of over 200km. These will all be delivered over the coming months as Ukraine prepares to intensify its resistance to the ongoing Russian invasion. This equipment will support Ukraine over the coming months in their anticipated military surge to counter Russian forces. During their meeting today the prime minister will discuss with President Zelenskyy what support Ukraine needs from the international community, both in terms of immediate military equipment and long-term defences. Martin Belam has more coverage on our Ukraine live blog.

It looks like we will see a good example of that today when Suella Braverman, the home secretary, addresses the National Conservatism (NatCon) conference in London. Of course, she will not be pitching it like that explicitly, but that it how it will be seen by many Conservatives, who are expecting a contest after the next election, and expecting Braverman to be a favourite in that ballot. After the local elections, the psephologists who analysed the results for the BBC and Sky News argued that the vote share suggested Labour is on course to be the largest party after a general election, but probably without an outright majority. Today Labour Together, a Starmerite thinktank, has published research suggesting the results do show the party on course for an outright majority. This conclusion is based on polling suggesting that a significant number of people who voted Lib Dem or Green in the locals would vote Labour in a general election. Here is the Labour Together summary. Labour Together’s analysis found that: -If replicated in a general election, Labour’s lead in the local elections would secure Labour a majority in Parliament. Labour Together asked those who voted at the locals whether they would vote differently at a general election. Accounting for this, a 9-point lead in the projected national vote share, calculated by the BBC, becomes a 13-point lead at a general election [which would be enough for an outright majority]. -The Liberal Democrat surge was largely tactical voting against the Conservatives. In the 54 councils where the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats had the largest number of councillors, the Lib Dems gained 214 seats while Labour gained only 69. But in the 93 councils which were Conservative-Labour contests, Labour won 335 councillors and the Lib Dems increased their tally by only 48. -Many Liberal Democrat voters will return to Labour. 21% of Liberal Democrat voters at the local elections said that they voted for the party that was “best placed to defeat a party I disliked, even though they were not my first choice.” Nearly a quarter (23%) of the Liberal Democrats’ local election vote plans to vote Labour at the next general election. Just 44% intend to vote Lib Dem. -Fewer than half (44%) of Green voters would vote the same way at a general election (the same proportion as the Lib Dems). The Green party drew voters from both the Conservatives and Labour, with 40% of their vote coming from 2019 Labour voters and 23% from 2019 Conservative voters. At a general election, however, the Greens would hold onto less than half of their vote, with Labour the biggest beneficiary. We may get to hear what Keir Starmer thinks about this shortly; he is holding his LBC phone-in shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Keir Starmer holds his regular ‘Call Keir’ LBC phone-in. 10am; Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory former business secretary, speaks at the National Conservatism (NatCon) conference in London. At 2pm Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is speaking. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 1.50pm (UK time): Liz Truss, the former PM, takes part in a live Q&amp;A at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit. 2.30pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons.

    <head>Kaye Donachie: Song for the Last Act review – painted women who refuse to sit still and be pretty</head>
    <body>The longer you look at Kaye Donachie’s portraits, the weirder they get. All of them avoid looking you in the eye. Their gazes slide away; they look to the side, are cast down or are occupied elsewhere. Consumed by the unseen, they can appear distracted or appalled. These are paintings, after all, not beings trapped in a frame. They aren’t even portraits. They have their beginnings in old black and white photographs, but their faces belong to no one. Ghosts flicker through her paintings … Notes Shift, 2023, by Kaye Donachie. Photograph: Barney Hindle/© Kaye Donachie. Courtesy Maureen Paley, London Donachie uses these photographic faces as an armature for her brushstrokes. With their fades, shadows and blushes, their swipes and flickers recall other paintings as much as they animate these imaginary people. Donachie’s painted women are knowing constructs, and I get the feeling they could lose their composure at any moment, turn and smile, laugh, fly apart, disintegrate. She makes use of the play between the paint and the makeup her women wear, the patches of rouge, the shadows under a cheekbone, the interplay of nature and artifice. It is all a complicated game. Lively, animated, disturbed, motivated by something other than our attention, these painted women refuse to sit still and be pretty. The paintings also seem to have built-in flaws and glitches, places where modelling misregisters or goes awry and description falters. This is clearly deliberate. Displayed in the largest room of Pallant House’s original Queen Anne townhouse, they surround us, and you have the feeling that their gazes are communing among themselves rather than with us. The women who inspire Donachie, and whose ghosts flicker through her paintings include Lee Miller, Claude Cahun (for whom role play was integral to her life and art), poets Emily Dickinson and Iris Tree. Her titles, too, often taken from lines and snatches of poems, misdirect us as much as they are clues to some inner temperament or situation or a nod to a particular individual or time. The conjunction between Donachie and Gwen John does the latter no favours, and even though the link between the two exhibitions is happenstance Donachie’s Song for the Last Act is paired with Pallant House’s retrospective of Gwen John (1876-1939), which fills a suite of rooms in the gallery’s modern extension. The conjunction between Donachie and John does the latter no favours, and even though the link between the two exhibitions is happenstance, comparisons are unavoidable. Compositional and tonal variety: Mère Poussepin by Gwen John, 1915-20. Photograph: © Barber Institute John’s show coincides with the publication of her biography by Alicia Foster. John’s life is more interesting than her art. Though she remains something of an enigma and a mass of contradictions, John feels meek, dull and repressed as an artist. For me, her paintings shrink away. Her women sit with a book or a cat. Their shoulders droop, their expressions are glum or downright miserable, the colour close-toned and greyed, the atmosphere claustrophobic. It is as though all light and life has been drained away. I find her work enervating. Even the repetitions in her paintings – the same poses, the same colour and compositions repeated again and again – lack the serial quality and variation you get, say, in Giorgio Morandi. John’s work at Pallant House is interrupted by paintings by her peers: a Pierre Bonnard, a Édouard Vuillard, a small head of a boy by Cézanne, and there’s a hideous, slick and over-ripe painting by Augustus John, Gwen’s brother. Gwen John was never trying to compete with any of the artists who surrounded her. For some years she was the sculptor Rodin’s model and lover (the relationship was fraught), and she also had a number of sexual relationships with women. She read and reread Freud on sexuality, turned to Catholicism and ultimately gave up painting altogether. Among letters and other ephemera, a little crucifix she owned sits in a vitrine, though I don’t know why we need to see this. She also painted a series of portraits of nuns, whose habits at least give us a bit of compositional and tonal variety. Coming to the end of John’s show, we return to Donachie, who has hung one of her own paintings among a selection of works she has chosen from Pallant House’s extensive collection. Artists often make interesting curators: they have their own stake in other people’s art. Édouard Manet’s etching of a Spanish dancer, and an etching of his Olympia, give way to Walter Sickert, surrealist Eileen Agar and British pop artist Pauline Boty among others. These small-scale works are all hung on a long wall that Donachie has papered, floor to ceiling, with vertical panels, as though it were an opened-out folding screen. There are horizons, discs, a repeated curlicue like a detail of a bit of ironwork. The panels evoke Matisse and the works that float on this background depict inner and outer lives, cities, landscapes, desires. In a second room a Cézanne lithograph of his male bathers hangs beside the oddly repressed homoerotic works of Keith Vaughan. Later we come to Duncan Grant’s lounging male bathers, with their lingering looks and sexy poses and a wonderful drawing by feminist artist Jacqueline Morreau depicting a naked woman lying beside a mirror, who returns her own gaze in the glass. You do a double-take: is this one woman or two? Interplay of nature and artifice … Donachie’s To Echo, 2023. Photograph: Barney Hindle/© Kaye Donachie. Courtesy Maureen Paley, London There are some great and unexpected things here, all overseen by a single painting by Donachie that depicts a woman seen in profile, leaning forward, hands clasped under her chin, as though enrapt. The title, Monotonous Remorse, seems at odds with the woman’s expression, as if intended as a misdirection. The phrase comes from a poem by Tree (1897-1968), a poet, actor and artist’s model. Tree was, coincidentally, painted by Augustus John and Grant, modelled for sculptor Jacob Epstein and was photographed by Man Ray. In later life she appeared in Fellini’s 1960 movie La Dolce Vita. You want to know her. Life, with all its multiple and random connections, comes tumbling out. Donachie wants to acknowledge hidden depths and mysteries through her work and its staging, while Gwen John performs her strange disappearing act in the middle of it all. • Kaye Donachie: Song for the Last Act and Gwen John: Art and Life in London and Paris are both at Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, until 8 October.</body>

    <head>Sale dreaming of Premiership glory and northern rugby union revival</head>
    <body>There was one sentence uttered on Sunday that best summed up the challenge Sale Sharks face. It did not come from the director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, or the man of the match George Ford, rather from the taxi driver on the way to the AJ Bell Stadium. He had not heard of it and needed the postcode to get there. “Are you sure you don’t mean the Etihad?” Sale are fighting what can sometimes feel like a losing battle for exposure and for eyeballs against two of the biggest football teams in the world. They must coexist in rugby league territory for good measure and that they can feel ignored in the north of England in what is often a southern-centric sport only adds to the challenge. Related: Maitland scores twice to ease superior Saracens past Northampton into final Judging by the sold-out show they put on for their Premiership playoff win against Leicester, thus booking a first final appearance in 17 years, fans are making a good fist of it, displaying energy and enthusiasm to match Sanderson’s side. Sanderson is northern to the core. He had received other job offers while at Saracens but it was the chance to come home that finally persuaded him to leave. Delivering on the field is his priority but he makes no secret of the fact that reinvigorating northern rugby union is also chief among them. It is why he convinced Ford – the standout performer against Leicester and another with roots in the north‑west – to join last summer. More than that, it can be seen in the identity of Sale’s two try-scorers against Leicester. Tom Roebuck and Arron Reed are 22 and 23 respectively, academy graduates with bright futures. Joe Carpenter, originally from Leeds, showcased the kind of form that won him a place in the Premiership team of the season. Gus Warr and Raffi Quirke are two young scrum‑halves, and Sanderson pointed to Simon McIntyre and Tommy Taylor, less heralded signings who, like Ford, chose to go back to their roots. “Imagine the scenario where players actually played for the shirt, the badge and the area. It’s gone out of the game,” Sanderson said. “Where is the north? I remember the north playing New Zealand when I was a kid! And the north is here – and it’s in Newcastle. But, right now, we’re flying the flag. And, yeah, I’m super proud of that. I can’t talk too much about it because I start to cry and get too emotional. To come home to this team – the team I played for, captained, that my brother played for, that my dad played against – it’s a bit of a dream, isn’t it.” Alex Sanderson greets fans outside the AJ Bell Stadium before Sale’s Premiership semi-final. Photograph: Roger Evans/Action Plus/Shutterstock Sanderson believes the playoff triumph on Sunday can be just the start. They head to Twickenham on Saturday week for their first final since 2006 but should they become regulars in the league’s showpiece event, you wonder if Premiership organisers may consider taking it on the road. A final at Old Trafford would be hugely significant in Sale’s quest to inspire future Reeds and Roebucks. Participation numbers are on the wane in the north-west and the Sharks do not just want to grow the fanbase but the player pool, too. “One of the reasons why for us is making the people of the north proud,” Ford said. “Rugby union up here has got its challenges as we all know. All we can do as a club is perform well, try to win games, fill the place out like [Sunday] and try to entertain these people, give them a winning team that care and compete. We want to inspire the kids as well. The amount of kids you saw out there with smiles on their faces – ultimately that’s what it’s about. When we’ve finished and are long gone from the game they’re the people that will come in and take the game forward. If we can inspire kids to come and play up here, northern lads playing for Sale, that’s what we want.” The former Wasps back Paolo Odogwu is a surprise inclusion in Italy’s World Cup training squad. The 26-year-old, who has represented England at age-grade level, was on the fringes of Eddie Jones’s side two years ago but never won a cap and has been selected for the Azzurri by the head coach Kieran Crowley. In early 2021 Odogwu, who is of English, Italian and Nigerian descent, was arguably the Premiership’s standout performer. Able to play at centre or on the wing, he was called up by Jones for the Six Nations campaign but while he remained in camp throughout he bizarrely never featured in a matchday squad. He had previously represented England at under-18 and under-20 level, coming through the Leicester academy before moving to Sale, then Wasps. Italy had made contact with him before his call-up by Jones but at the time Odogwu sought to pursue an international career with England. The demise of Wasps last year prompted a move to Stade Francais, however, and though he remains eligible for England as part of the exception made by the Rugby Football Union for players whose clubs went bust, he is now on course to represent Italy at the World Cup later this year. The Harlequins second row Dino Lamb, who has also represented England at under-20 level, has also been included by Italy. Odogwu told the Mail on Sunday earlier this year: “I’d love to go to the World Cup. That would be cool. I’ll be 30 by the next World Cup [in 2027] and you never know what’s going to happen. There’s so much grey area with England, new coaches, me playing in France, and I feel they’d rather take someone from the Premiership. If England didn’t want me then I might have the opportunity to play for Italy. There’s a lot to think about because once you’ve made the decision then that’s it. If I get the opportunity this year I would love to go.&quot; The Rugby Football Union can help, too. In 2007 England played Argentina at Old Trafford but that was technically a home match for Los Pumas so the warmup match in Newcastle against Italy four years ago was a first home Test away from Twickenham outside the World Cup since 1997. This summer the post‑pandemic recovery means they have to squeeze every last drop out of the Twickenham cash cow but they would do well to get on the road again. After all the England head coach, Steve Borthwick, is from Cumbria, his right-hand man Kevin Sinfield from Oldham and his captain, Owen Farrell, from Wigan. The northern influence on England is obvious so it is incumbent on the RFU to give something back.</body>

    <head>‘I’ll wear it with pride’: Geraint Thomas in pink jersey as Covid hits Giro d’Italia</head>
    <body>Geraint Thomas will wear the race leader’s jersey on Tuesday in the 10th stage of the Giro d’Italia following the withdrawal, late on Sunday night, of Remco Evenepoel following a positive test for Covid-19. The 23-year-old Belgian had been the outstanding favourite to claim overall victory in Rome on 28 May, but after a weary performance on Sunday in the 35-kilometre time trial, in which he beat Thomas by a single second, he withdrew that evening. The world road race champion relinquished the leader’s pink jersey, or maglia rosa, to Thomas. Related: Leader Remco Evenepoel pulls out of Giro d’Italia with Covid-19 “Leading the race is a massive honour,” Thomas said. “It’s not the way you want to take the lead but it’s what’s happened and that’s the way it is. So yes, I’ll wear it with pride.” Thomas said he was “shocked” when he heard, direct from Evenepoel on Sunday evening, that he was leaving the race. “I speak to him a bit and he messaged me, just before his announcement. At first, I thought: ‘Is he winding me up?’ But it’s a huge disappointment, even for me. I was looking forward to a really good battle. It’s a huge disappointment for everyone.” Covid-19 has already exerted a significant influence on the Giro this year, forcing a hasty reshuffle on the part of Primoz Roglic’s Jumbo-Visma team shortly before the race started. Thomas said his Ineos Grenadiers team would now be further tightening their own health protocols. “I guess we need to be a lot more aware of it and go back to what we used to [do] when we were in our own little bubble and wearing masks, in public spaces,” said Thomas. “As a team we’re going to go back to that kind of strategy.” Despite the presence of the virus in the peloton, there has been no indication as yet from either the race organisers, or the UCI, cycling’s world governing body, that teams will retreat into the strict isolated bubbles that characterised the 2020 season. “If everybody on the race does the same thing then it will stop other riders going home,” Thomas said. “Obviously it’s a massive loss losing any rider to Covid, especially a world champion like Remco.” Thomas and his Ineos Grenadiers team are now in a dominant position tactically. With the second-placed Roglic sandwiched between the 2018 Tour de France champion and, in third place, the 2020 Giro champion Tao Geoghegan Hart, the British outfit can afford to wait for Roglic to make his move. Evenepoel has withdrawn after a positive Covid-19 test. Photograph: Shutterstock “Myself and Tao are both co-leaders [in the team],” Thomas said. “I’ve got the jersey but he’s close behind. Roglic is super close and the top 10 is all still close. We haven’t done a mountain top finish yet, and the race is still in the balance.” One of Thomas’s great strengths in Grand Tour racing is his durability. “I don’t feel too much pressure or expectation,” he said, while admitting he “didn’t expect to be the leader on the first rest day”. Thomas added: “I’m normally at my best level in week three and I hope that will be the case again. My time trial on Sunday was already much better than the first day, so hopefully I will continue to improve.” An understudy to Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome for so many years, before his Tour win five years ago, Thomas is now among the most consistent performers in the peloton. Maybe too, it’s about time he was taken more seriously. “Everyone always doubts me,” he said after narrowly missing out on a stage victory in the time trial on Sunday. Perhaps his dry and sometimes self-deprecating humour works against him, yet even his own team management were forced to admit they had misjudged his form after last year’s Tour, in which he finished third overall to the runner-up Tadej Pogacar and the champion, Jonas Vingegaard. Neither Pogacar or Vingegaard are racing in Italy, which leaves Roglic and teammate Geoghegan Hart as the main obstacles to a second Grand Tour win. “Both me and Tao are in a great position,” Thomas said. “I’m leading the race but as soon as someone stands out as the more likely to win then... I’ll be happy to help Tao, if he’s more likely to win and I’m sure he’d do the same thing.”</body>

    <body>5.47pm BST Microsoft ruling: what the experts say Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, says: “Investors will know that getting the thumbs up from EU regulators is still a very long way from Microsoft getting the global green light to go ahead with its deal to take over games developer Activision. “The UK competitions watchdog has already held up a red card and in the US, regulators are heading to court after filing a lawsuit to block the deal. “But the European Commission says it’s satisfied with the measures Microsoft has put in place. This feels slightly uncomfortable for the UK after comments from Microsoft president Brad Smith that Europe was a better place to start a business. “Why the difference in stance, and will the CMA’s ruling hold up in court which is where this dispute is expected to end up? There’s a huge amount of money on the table and a big question about what the future of gaming will look like.” Alex Haffner, competition partner at law firm Fladgate, says there is clearly a lot to play for: “The European Commission’s decision leaves clear blue water between it and the UK CMA in their assessment of whether competitive concerns as to the future of the cloud gaming market could properly be dealt with through (behavioural) commitments offered by the parties. Whereas the Commission felt these commitments, essentially a form of open licensing allowing gamers to stream Activision games on the platform/device of their choice were “sufficiently comprehensive”, the CMA’s earlier decision described the same form of commitments as too static and unable to account for changes in the market over time. Critics of the CMA’s stance, of which there have been many, will inevitably seize on today’s decision as proving the point made that the UK’s regulatory regime is too rigid and stifles innovation. Microsoft and Activision’s lawyers will also use the decision to provide greater ballast to their appeal of the CMA’s decision which is in the works. What is now at stake, however, is not just any perceived differences in the UK and EU regulatory regimes, but more fundamentally whether the power wielded by big tech needs to be dealt with through structural rather than behavioural means. It is worth remembering also that the US Federal Trade Commission has yet to reach its final decision in connection with the same merger and many have suggested they too are gunning for Big Tech. Professor Suzanne Rab, competition and EU law barrister at Serle Court chambers, predicts that Europe’s decision is unlikely to stop the CMA’s current hawkish enforcement stance in merger control which shows it is prepared to tread its own path. “Whether the UK decision will scupper the whole deal remains to be seen as an appeal is understood to be underway. However, the parties and their advisers will no doubt be taking a long hard look at the global implications of different approaches of the merger authorities to a deal with global and complex impacts.” 4.06pm BST CMA: We stand by our decision on MS-Activision deal A late newsflash: the head of the Competition and Markets Authority says the UK watchdog stands by its decision to block the $69bn Microsoft-Activision deal, even though European regulators have ruled the other way today. Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, says its experts considered, and rejected, MS’s remediation proposal: “The UK, US and European competition authorities are unanimous that this merger would harm competition in cloud gaming. The CMA concluded that cloud gaming needs to continue as a free, competitive market to drive innovation and choice in this rapidly evolving sector. “Microsoft’s proposals, accepted by the European Commission today, would allow Microsoft to set the terms and conditions for this market for the next ten years. They would replace a free, open and competitive market with one subject to ongoing regulation of the games Microsoft sells, the platforms to which it sells them, and the conditions of sale. This is one of the reasons the CMA’s independent panel group rejected Microsoft’s proposals and prevented this deal. “While we recognise and respect that the European Commission is entitled to take a different view, the CMA stands by its decision.” 3.58pm BST Closing post Time to wrap up… here are today’s main stories: Related: Supermarket bosses face grilling on fuel prices from watchdog Related: EU approves Microsoft’s takeover of Activision Blizzard Related: Kemi Badenoch flying to Switzerland to discuss post-Brexit trade deal Related: European economy expected to grow faster than forecast, says EU Related: Royal Mail faces possible fine as regulator looks into late deliveries Related: UK could unlock £70bn a year in renewable energy, report claims Related: Vice files for bankruptcy protection amid cut-price sale to consortium Related: Isle of Man to grow cannabis business to diversify economy Related: Average monthly rent outside London now more than £1,000, says agency Related: Average monthly rent outside London now more than £1,000, says agency Related: George Osborne to lead £2.4bn investment management firm Related: John Lewis owner picks Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to replace agency behind hit Christmas ads Related: Center Parcs UK goes up for sale with near £5bn price tag Related: Currys sales improve as shoppers ‘chase deals’ with credit 3.49pm BST EU approves Microsoft&apos;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard Newsflash: the European Commission has cleared the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, just three weeks after the UK blocked the deal. Following an in-depth investigation, the EC has concluded that Microsoft would not be able to harm rival consoles and rival multi-game subscription services, if it took control of the Call of Duty computer game maker. The Commission argues that Microsoft would have no incentive to refuse to distribute Activision’s games to Sony, the leading distributor of console games worldwide. Instead, they say, Microsoft would have strong incentives to continue distributing Activision’s games via a device as popular as Sony’s PlayStation. However, the EC has concluded that the $68.7bn acquisition would harm competition in the distribution of PC and console games via cloud game streaming services. They say: … if Microsoft made Activision’s games exclusive to its own cloud game streaming service, Game Pass Ultimate, and withheld them from rival cloud game streaming providers, it would reduce competition in the distribution of games via cloud game streaming. In response, Microsoft is offering two commitments, which the EC say are a “significant improvement for cloud game streaming”. They are: A free license to consumers in the EEA that would allow them to stream, via any cloud game streaming services of their choice, all current and future Activision Blizzard PC and console games for which they have a license. A corresponding free license to cloud game streaming service providers to allow EEA-based gamers to stream any Activision Blizzard’s PC and console games. #EUMergerControl Commission 🇪🇺 clears acquisition of Activision Blizzard 🎮by Microsoft, subject to conditions 👇 🔗➡️https://t.co/qG3D0jNfPo pic.twitter.com/Q3P2miYisH — EU Competition (@EU_Competition) May 15, 2023 Announcing the decision, the Commission says: Taking into consideration the feedback of the market, the Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns and would ultimately unlock significant benefits for competition and consumers. The Commission’s decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments. Under supervision of the Commission, an independent trustee will be in charge of monitoring their implementation. Updated at 4.05pm BST 3.40pm BST Wembley wasn’t the only place to see an exciting penalty shootout last weekend. A popular charity football match between PR executives and journalists yesterday, at AFC Wimbledon’s Plough Lane, went to spot kicks, with the hacks triumphing over the flacks. It was the first time the grudge match has taken place since Covid, and it raised more than £10,000 for AFC Wimbledon Foundation, which helps the elderly and children in some of the most economically challenged areas of the UK. The journos took a 2-0 lead, with the second goal created from a (doubless brilliant) cross by my colleague Richard Partington, before the match ended 2-2. This set up a thrilling penalty shoot out which the Hacks won 9-8 (no word of any panenkas, though…..) What a day. I’ve done my leg, but great to get the 2-2 draw after full time (don’t mention the penalties)! Thanks to all who organised it. — stu jackson (@flackhackjack) May 14, 2023 3.39pm BST Guy Hands loses bid to stop UK unwinding £8bn military homes deal The UK government has won the right to take back control over thousands of military homes worth £8bn after a court ruled that the previous privatisation was a “bad deal” for the government, in a major blow to private equity investor Guy Hands. London’s high court ruled on Monday that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has the right to buy back the remaining 38,000 homes, which were bought in 1996 by Annington, a group of companies ultimately controlled by Hands, for £1.7bn. Annington immediately said it planned to appeal the decision. MPs on parliament’s public accounts committee later described the sell-off as “disastrous for taxpayers” because it did not include clauses to give it a share of future price rises for the properties. The government missed out on as much as £4.2bn as the value of the 57,400 homes rose, the MPs said. However, the MoD remained a leaseholder paying rents to Annington. Government lawyers advised that ministers had the right to enfranchisement, the ability to buy the freehold of leased properties. Annington had argued that the government should not have that right, and that the state was exercising its powers improperly. Related: Guy Hands firm challenges MoD over controversial £8bn property estate Mr Justice Holgate found that there was no way to say the government’s “motive was improper” in wanting to take back the properties, as the defence secretary was “entitled to make legitimate use of such bargaining power as he has”. He wrote: “The arrangements were and still remain a bad deal for the MoD, its [service family accommodation] estate and the public purse”. An Annington spokesperson said: “We are surprised and disappointed by the outcome. It risks setting a dangerous precedent for businesses and international investors in the UK and if upheld would mean that the government can disregard long-term contracts if it believes it is in its interests to do so. As we consider this to be a matter of significant public importance, we will appeal this decision.” If the appeal were unsuccessful, the victory in the test case would allow the government to take back control of the whole estate. If it proceeds, it will pay a price decided by a court. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “We welcome the decision of the high court, which finds that the MoD acted lawfully in seeking, successfully, to establish its right to enfranchisement. “No decision has been taken on further enfranchisement cases, but we will consider the high court’s decision and the potential implications for securing better value for money for the taxpayer.” The judgment showed that government officials had in 2021 advised ministers to move quickly to take back the properties to because “a scenario in which MoD waited for Guy Hands to crystallise a very significant profit, walk away, and then MoD decided to exercise its rights against the new owner [...] would be reputationally very damaging for MoD”. Natasha Rees, a senior partner at Forsters, a law firm which represented the government, said: “The high court has found that MoD does benefit from a right to enfranchise. MoD will now consider whether enfranchisement might achieve better value for money for the taxpayer. The case involved complex aspects of the law of enfranchisement, some of which had never been decided before.” 3.17pm BST Manufacturing activity in the New York state region has slumped by the most in more than three years as orders and shipments fell abruptly.

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “We are very pleased to hear that the Competition and Markets Authority has confirmed what we have been saying for a long time about the biggest retailers taking more margin per litre on fuel than they have in the past. Currently, the average price of diesel is more than 20p a litre overpriced simply because they refuse to cut their prices. The wholesale price of diesel is actually 4p lower than petrol, yet across the country it is being sold for 9p a litre more – 154.31p compared to 144.95p for unleaded. “Something badly needs to change to give drivers who depend on their vehicles every day a fair deal at the pumps. We hope even better news will be forthcoming later this summer.” 2.17pm BST Ofcom launches investigation into Royal Mail’s delivery performance From petrol and groceries…. to post. Ofcom, the communication’s regulator, has launched an investigation into Royal Mail’s failure to meet its delivery targets for 2022/23. Ofcom says that Royal Mail is meant to hit several targets, including: delivering 93% of First Class mail within one working day of collection; delivering 98.5% of Second Class mail within three working days of collection; and completing 99.9% of delivery routes on each day that a delivery is required. Royal Mail has missed those performance targets, by some distances, in 2022/23, Ofcom says, as it: delivered 73.7% of First Class mail within one working day; delivered 90.7% of Second Class mail within three working days; and completed 89.35% of delivery routes for each day on which a delivery was required. Back in March, MPs accused Royal Mail of “systemically” failing to deliver parts of its obligations.

Not in groceries but in the sale of petrol and diesel. CMA investigation decides the “indications are that higher pump prices cannot be attributed solely to factors outside the control of the retailers.” pic.twitter.com/xgwA121tYa — Joel Hills (@ITVJoel) May 15, 2023 2.01pm BST Explaining today’s announcement’s, Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, says: The rising cost of living is putting people and businesses under sustained financial pressure. The CMA is determined to do what it can to ensure competition helps contain these pressures as much as possible. Our Road Fuel market study is nearly complete. Although much of the pressure on pump prices is down to global factors including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have found evidence that suggests weakening retail competition is contributing to higher prices for drivers at the pumps. We are also concerned about the sustained higher margins on diesel compared to petrol we have seen this year. We are not satisfied that all the supermarkets have been sufficiently forthcoming with the evidence they have provided in our Road Fuel market study, so we will be calling them in for formal interviews to get to the bottom of what is going on. It is a priority for the CMA to publish a full and final report, including recommendations for action, by the beginning of July. Grocery and food shopping are essential purchases. We recognise that global factors are behind many of the grocery price increases, and we have seen no evidence at this stage of specific competition problems. But, given ongoing concerns about high prices, we are stepping up our work in the grocery sector to help ensure competition is working well and people can exercise choice with confidence. Updated at 2.02pm BST 1.59pm BST Competition watchdog steps up work on grocery sector The UK’s competition authorities are also stepping up its work investigating the grocery sector, amid concerns that supermarkets have been hiking prices unfairly. The CMA says it has started work looking into unit pricing practices online and instore. So far, it has not seen evidence of competition concerns, and points out that global factors – such as the Ukraine war – have also been the main driver of grocery price increases. But, the CMA says, it is “important to be sure that weak competition is not adding to the problems”. So it is now intentifying its work, and focusing on the areas where people are experiencing greatest cost of living pressures. The watchdog will: First, completing work to assess how competition is working overall in the grocery retail market, drawing on publicly available data and other information. Second, in parallel, identifying which product categories, if any, might merit closer examination across the supply chain. The announcement comes a day before prime minister Rishi Sunak hosts a summit at Downing Street to discuss the food crisis, with ministers, farmers and industry leaders.

In a new update on the cost of living crisis, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) warns that some “weakening of competion” in the road fuel retail market has driven up the prices paid by drivers at the pumps. The CMA says that high pump prices cannot be solely blamed on global factors, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The CMA says: Evidence gathered by the CMA indicates that fuel margins have increased across the retail market, but in particular for supermarkets, over the past 4 years. As a result of these increasing margins, average 2022 supermarket pump prices appear to be around 5 pence per litre more expensive than they would have been had their average percentage margins remained at 2019 levels. Although supermarkets still tend to be the cheapest retail suppliers of fuel, evidence from internal documents indicates that at least one supermarket has significantly increased its internal forward-looking margin targets over this period. Other supermarkets have recognised this change in approach and may have adjusted their pricing behaviour accordingly. The CMA is also concerned that competition in the diesel market has weakened this year While some degree of variation in diesel retail margin is to be expected given the high levels of volatility in diesel wholesale prices, the high margins in 2023 appear to have gone on longer than would be expected. The CMA needs to understand whether weaker competition is part of the explanation for this. Last month, the RAC accused forecourt owners of charging more than necessary for diesel: Related: UK forecourt owners accused of charging more for diesel than necessary The CMA also suggests that UK supermarkets have not provided evidence to the watchdog in a timely way, saying: Whilst the level of engagement with the study has varied across supermarkets, we are not satisfied that they have all been sufficiently forthcoming with the evidence they have provided. In particular, important information has only been received late in the day and after several rounds of information gathering. Given the concerns we have about a market of such importance to millions of drivers it is vital we get to the bottom of what is going on. 1.23pm BST Fed&apos;s Bostic: We may need to go up on interest rates In the US, Atlanta Federal Reserve president Raphael Bostic has dampened hopes that interest rates could be cut this year. In an interview with CNBC, Bostic said he doesn’t foresee any rate cuts in 2023, even if there is a recession. Bostic said: “My baseline case is we won’t really be thinking about cutting until well into 2024. “If you look at most measures of inflation, they’re still two times where our target is. And so that’s a long distance still to go.” The coore personal consumption expenditures price index (excluding food and energy), the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation, rose by 4.6% in the year to March, or more than double the Fed’s target of 2% inflation. Bostic cautioned that he does not expect US inflation to fall as fast as market participants believe. If anything “we may have to go up” on interest rates, Bostic suggested, adding: “If there is going to be a bias to action, for me there would be a bias to increase a little further, as opposed to cut.” Updated at 1.27pm BST 1.15pm BST Back in the City, shares in online fashion chain ASOS have hit their lowest level in 13 years, after several analysts downgraded their estimates for the company. ASOS’s shares are down 16% at 424p, the lowest since February 2010. The selloff came after JP Morgan cut its target price for ASOS to 610p, from £10. Last week, ASOS reported a £291m pre-tax loss, and a 10% slump in UK sales in the six months to the end of February, much worse than expected. The £291m pre-tax loss, against a £16m loss a year before, came after writing down more than £100m on unwanted stock as Asos focused on a narrow range of products and tried to update its fashions more quickly. Related: Asos falls £291m into the red as shoppers return to high street 1.06pm BST European factories had a surprisingly weak March, new data today suggests. Eurozone industrial production shrank by 4.1% during March, reversing a 1.5% rise in February, and rather worse than the 2.5% fall expected. ING’s Bert Colijn says most major economies posted “significant declines in production”, with output also pulled down by “a curious decline in Ireland”. Colijn says: The decline in March (following a 1.5% rise in February) brings industrial production back to the lowest reading since October 2021. This is in large part related to a huge drop in the Irish “computer, electronics and optical products” industry, which saw production drop by more than 50% in March. This industry is generally volatile and therefore tends to overstate the trend. Moody’s Analytics senior economist, Kamil Kovar, is hopeful that eurozone fatory output will soon jump, and says the ‘“grim” 4.1% drop in production paints a misleading picture. This series showed a lot of volatility of late, and hence the decline is likely be reversed in next month. Similarly, a more measured decline in car production this month is likely to be reversed in coming months. Overall, we expect large jump in industrial production next month, followed by moderate growth during spring months.” Updated at 1.06pm BST 12.47pm BST Elon Musk meets Emmanuel Macron in Paris Twitter, now X.

Updated at 12.54pm BST 12.36pm BST The pound is nudging back towards its highest level in over a year today. Sterling has gained half a cent against the US dollar this morning, at $1.2505, closer to the 12-month high of $1.2679 set last week. The pound is benefiting from growing hopes that the UK economy will avoid recession, and expectations that UK interest rates will rise at least once more this year. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, says: “The pound should remain well supported in the coming weeks. A cheap valuation and a relatively hawkish Bank of England should remain tailwinds, and sterling does not have the same positioning issues that the euro suffers from in the short-term.” 12.27pm BST We also have promising signs that Europe’s inflationary squeeze is ebbing. The wholesale prices charged by producers across Germany fell by 0.5% on a year-on-year basis in April, the first annual decrease since December 2020. They dropped by 0.4% on a monthly basis too. Statistics body Destatis reports that the year-on-year decrease was mainly due to a 15.7% drop in mineral oil product prices. Scrap and residual materials (-31,5 %), cereals, raw tobacco, seeds and feedstuff (-25.2%), ores, metals and semi-finished metal products (-20.5%) and chemical products (-5.4%) were also cheaper than a year ago. But other prices continued to rise – including the wholesale cost of fruit, vegetables and potatoes, which was 22% higher than a year ago. Building materials and elements (+13.9%) and living animals (+11.4%) also cost notably more than in April 2022. Updated at 12.27pm BST 12.07pm BST In the UK property sector, the average monthly rent on a newly-let property outside London has risen past £1,000 for the first time, data from estate agents Hamptons shows. While many renters in the capital will be used to handing over four figures a month on rent, this is a new milestone (or possibly millstone) for the rest of the country. Bloomberg reports: The average monthly rent on a newly let home outside of London surpassed £1,000 for the first time in April, according to a report from broker Hamptons International. That’s almost 8% higher than the same month last year, piling more pressure on tenants in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. “With rents on the open market rising quickly, tenants will face the choice of staying put or moving to a smaller home in a more affordable area,” said Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons. “While anyone choosing to sit tight tends to face smaller rental increases than those moving home, they are not immune.” Renters outside of London are paying over £1,000 a month for the first time https://t.co/2i6OSHCYgs via @_DamianShepherd pic.twitter.com/TEloUYQfwn — Zoe Schneeweiss (@ZSchneeweiss) May 15, 2023 11.56am BST Full story: European economy expected to grow faster than forecast Europe’s economy is expected to grow faster than previously thought this year and next, despite high inflation and rising interest rates, according to the European Commission. The commission said the EU’s 27 members would grow at an average of 1% in 2023, up from a previous estimate of 0.8%. It nudged its forecast for growth in 2024 to 1.7% from 1.6%.

In London the FTSE 100 has hit its highest level in almost a week, up 37 points or 0.5% at 7792 points. Mining companies and banks are among the risers. France’s CAC has also gained 0.5%, while Germany’s DAX is 0.2% higher. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: European indices have edged up on the open, with the FTSE 100 given a leg up after the dollar has strengthened, making the overseas earnings of multinational listings worth more. The pound has fallen back to $1.24 against the dollar, although it has strengthened very slightly. Investors appear to have run back into the greenback’s safe-haven arms as sentiment has been knocked about global growth prospects. This was not helped by a bleaker assessment of America’s prospects by consumers on Friday, as captured by the University of Michigan survey. Anxieties are colliding about the effect of high interest rates, combined with worries about the banking sector and now a potential US default as the debt ceiling deadline looms. The whipsaw in sentiment may continue this week with the US retail sales snapshot due out tomorrow. Although a recovery may help ease some concerns about falling optimism, it could also increase expectations that the Fed might be forced to hike interest rates further. 11.14am BST FT: UK holiday resort Center Parcs up for sale The Ariel Adventure at Center Parcs, Longleat, Wiltshire, England, United Kingdom. Photograph: E Westmacott/Alamy The Financial Times is reporting that UK holiday resort Center Parcs is up for sale. The planned sale, by Canadian private equity group Brookfield, will test investors’ willingness to bet on the UK economy as it faces high inflation and rising interest rates, the FT says. Brookfield are apparently seeking between £4bn and £5bn for Center Parcs, the family-focused holiday company which operates six villages in England and one in Ireland. The FT says: The decision to go ahead with the sale marks a bold move for Brookfield as the UK faces falling property values and higher interest rates. But a sale could potentially net a windfall for Brookfield, which acquired the resort group from Blackstone for about £2.4bn in 2015. Brookfield has appointed investment bankers who have been sounding out potential buyers in the past week, the people said. Brookfield and Center Parcs declined to comment. Center Parcs runs site at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Longleat Forest in Wiltshire, Elveden Forest in Suffolk, Woburn Forest in Bedfordshire and Whinfell Forest in Cumbria (where the red squirrels were on fine form at Easter, we can confirm), and Longford Forest in County Longford, Ireland.

The report says that before the Russian invasion last year, Ukraine’s economic development had been held back by “a somewhat uneven implementation of structural reforms”. It also suffered from regular interference from vested interests, plus “a high degree of corruption, chronically low levels of investment, and territorial disputes also linked to the 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia”. The EC says Ukraine has demonstrated remarkable resilience during the war, and its efforts towards joining the EU, having been granted candidate country status on 23 June 2022, should improve its prospects. But, GDP is estimated to have crumpled by over 29% last year in the war. Little recovery is expected this year, with growth of just 0.6% seen in 2023, rising to 4% in 2024. The report adds that an “ambitious reform programme” is needed to align Ukraine with its path into the European Union, saying: The outlook is, however, subject to extraordinary uncertainty and critically depends on the evolution of the war. Formidable efforts will be needed to attract investment and launch a full-scale reconstruction, the cost of which has been recently estimated at $411bn by the World Bank’s Rapid Damage and Needs Assessement II.

The EC is concerned that core inflation (stripping out food and energy costs) has been ‘firming’, saying: Falling energy commodity prices are driving a sharp fall in energy consumption bills and the overall rate of price growth from its October peak, but core inflation has been firming. As a result, markets have raised expectations about future policy rate hikes. The small contraction of core inflation in April suggests that it has also peaked, but the convergence towards target is now expected to take longer. Greater persistence of core inflation would call on monetary authorities to act even more forcefully to stem inflationary pressures. 9.42am BST “We can and should be proud of the fact that the European economy is showing such remarkable resilience,” commissioner Paolo Gentolini concludes. He says that succesful management of the energy crisis, coordination of fiscal policies, and Europe’s Recovery and Resilience Facility created to drive the recovery from Covid-19 all helped the economy do better. But there is “no reason for complacency.”, with inflation still high, Gentolini tells reporters in Brussels, adding: This means we must ensure that fiscal policy is consistent with our policy priorities. In the same vein, it is important to maintain the momentum in the implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Plans. Updated at 9.48am BST 9.33am BST But.... risks are tilted to the downside However….the balance of risks facing Europe’s economy has “tilted back to the downside” since February, the EC fears, despite lifting its forecasts today. Commissioner Gentolini says there are several reasons why the downside risks have increased, warning: Core price pressures could turn out more persistent if wages accelerate more than currently projected, and without adjustment in profit margins. Higher-than-expected core inflation would lead to a stronger reaction of monetary policy, with broad macroeconomic ramifications for investment and consumption. Risks related to the EU’s external environment remain elevated. New uncertainties following the banking sector turbulence, or related to wider geopolitical tensions, compound the long-standing concerns about the impact of rising interest rates on vulnerable emerging markets. And of course, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine continues to cast a long shadow of uncertainty over the economy. On the positive side, more benign developments in energy prices or a faster transmission of wholesale energy price declines to consumers would lead to a faster decline in headline inflation, with positive spillovers on domestic demand. Updated at 9.37am BST 9.31am BST In the first quarter of this year, GDP grew by 0.3% in the EU, which is slightly above the projection in February’s Winter Forecast, commissioner Paolo Gentolini points out, adding: Information available at this stage for only a few countries, points to subdued consumption growth and robust investment growth, despite tighter financing conditions. Net exports contributed to growth thanks to the improvement in the terms of trade and a strong tourism performance. For the second quarter, survey indicators suggest continued expansion, with services clearly outperforming the manufacturing sector. In particular, the energy-intensive manufacturing sectors are still reeling from the energy shock of last year. Consumer confidence has continued its recovery from last autumn’s historic low. 9.29am BST The EC has mixed news for workers today, in its new economic forecasts. On the upside, the labour market remains strong. The eurozone jobless rate is expected to remain at 6.8% this year, as in 2022, and drop to 6.7% next year. But on the downside, wage growth is set to fall short of inflation again this year – it may take until 2024 for a “significant recovery of real wages”. Commissioner Paolo Gentolini tells reporters in Brussels: The EU economy continues to be underpinned by the strongest labour market in decades. Unemployment rates keep hitting record lows. And the participation and employment rates stayed at record high. Despite the expected slowdown in economic activity, the labour market is set to remain strong. 9.25am BST The European economy is in better shape than we projected last autumn. It is holding up remarkably well in the face of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, leading to an upgrade in today’s growth forecast for 2023. Read the Spring #ECForecast ↓ — European Commission (@EU_Commission) May 15, 2023 9.22am BST Europe’s economy is benefitting from the decline in energy prices, commissioner Paolo Gentolini explains. The fall in energy commodity prices has helped push up today’s growth forecasts. Gentolini points out thaat Europe did not run out of gas last winter, as had been feared: Wholesale prices of gas and electricity in the EU have come down significantly from the peaks of last year, and continued declining even after the winter forecast. Thanks to effective diversification of supply and a sizeable fall in consumption – also supported by mild winter temperatures – the major concern for the European economy, that is a disruptive shortage of gas supply, did not materialise. Gas prices reached €35 per Megawatt hour at the end of last week, the lowest level since summer 2021 (and much lower than last August, when it hit €343/MwH). Gentolini adds: Futures prices for 2023 and 2024 have declined as well. As the EU approaches the gas-refilling season, gas storages are at comfortable levels and risks of shortages have considerably abated. Updated at 9.27am BST 9.18am BST Gentiloni: EU has avoided recession European commissioner Paulo Gentiloni is holding a press conference to explain today’s new economic forecasts. Gentiloni says the first important point is that the EU economy has avoided a recession. He says: It expanded in the first quarter and is set to continue growing moderately. Second, the key factors underpinning this forecast go in opposite directions: on the one hand, declining energy prices and a resilient labour market and, on the other hand, tightening financial conditions. Third, headline inflation is declining rapidly, but core inflation (headline inflation excluding more volatile energy and unprocessed food components) remains high. Fourth, government deficit and debt ratios continue declining. Fifth, the balance of risks has tilted back to the negative side. 9.12am BST Ireland is forecast to have the strongest GDP growth across the EU this year, at 5.5%. Germany, once the powerhouse economy, is only expected to grow by 0.2%, with France tipped for a 0.7% expansion in today’s new forecasts. Greece’s recovery continues, with growth of 2.4% expected this year. It’s the same story for Portugal, which also sought a bailout during the eurozone crisis a decade ago. And it’s nul points for Sweden, whose economy is forecast to shrink by 0.5% this year – the worst in the region.

The European Commission’s latest economic forecasts, just released, show that the economy “continues to show resilience in a challenging global context”. It says: The EU economy is managing the adjustment to the shocks unleashed by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression of Ukraine remarkably well. Last year, the EU successfully managed to largely wean itself off Russian gas. With fears of a recession easing, growth so far this year has been stronger than expected, they say. The EC now expects eurozone GDP to rise by 1.1% this year, up from 0.9% forecast in February, rising to 1.6% in 2024 (revised up from 1.5%). The wider EU economy is forecast to expand by 1.0% in 2023, an improvement on the 0.8% predict in its winter interim forecast three months ago. The recovery is expected to accelerate in 2024 with growth of 1.7% (revised up from 1.6%). Good news for European households and businesses. The Commission says: The European economy has managed to contain the adverse impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, weathering the energy crisis thanks to a rapid diversification of supply and a sizeable fall in gas consumption. Markedly lower energy prices are working their way through the economy, reducing firms’ production costs. Consumers are also seeing their energy bills fall, although private consumption is set to remain subdued as wage growth lags inflation. However, inflation has also been revised upwards compared to the winter, on the back of “persisting core price pressures”. Inflation is now expected to average 5.8% across the eurozone in 2023, and drop to 2.8% in 2024 – still above the European Central Bank’s target of 2%. Previously, inflation was forecast to average 5.6% this year, and 2.5% in 2024. In 2022, eurozone inflation averaged 8.4%, so these new forecasts only offer modest relief for consumers.

Apollo had until later this week to either submit a formal offer or walk away from talks following its exploratory bid at 240p per share, which was rebuffed by John Wood. But both companies have told the City this morning that Apollo does not intend to make an offer. John Wood says: The board remains confident in Wood’s strategic direction and long-term prospects and believes that, following a transformative year in 2022, including new executive leadership and a new strategy, Wood is well placed to deliver substantial value for shareholders. Shares have dropped by 35% in early trading, from 219p to 140p. Updated at 9.32am BST 8.33am BST Vice: what the media say Vice Media’s filing for bankruptcy protection punctuates “a relatively rapid decline for the media upstart”, says Bloomberg, adding: The Brooklyn-based company listed both assets and liabilities in the range of more than $500m to as much as $1bn in a Chapter 11 petition filed in Southern District of New York. Fortress Credit Corp. ranked among the biggest secured creditors, with claims totaling about $475m. The move caps a tumultuous few months for the firm. Vice shuttered its flagship TV news show and laid off more than 100 staff in late April. The FT points out that Vice was once-feted, but is now proposing to sell its business to a consortium of its lenders: The group, which is home to Vice News, Motherboard, Refinery29 and Vice TV, was once among the hottest new-media start-ups, winning a multibillion-dollar valuation based on its popularity with millennials attracted to an often anarchic style that reflected its roots as a punk magazine in Montreal. However, the group has struggled to turn its mix of news, entertainment and lifestyle into lasting financial success, undermined by audiences’ shift back to more traditional media groups and the tightening grip of tech giants such as Facebook on digital advertising in recent years. The New York Times (one of those ‘more traditional media groups’) dubs Vice a “decayed digital colossus”, adding: Vice, which had wooed media giants, has struggled to adjust to the punishing realities of digital publishing. A group of creditors could buy Vice for $225m. Updated at 9.32am BST 8.15am BST Vice files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Vice, the global news publisher and TV company that was once valued at nearly $6bn (£5bn), has filed for bankruptcy protection. The company, whose assets include Vice News, Motherboard, Refinery29 and Vice TV, has announced it has applied for Chapter 11 in the US bankruptcy court for the southern district of New York. Vice has also agreed a deal with a consortium of its lenders, including Fortress Investment Group, Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital. They have agreed to buy almost all Vice’s assets for $225m, and taken on some of its liabilities. Vice says it: Expects to Emerge As a Financially Healthy and Stronger Company in Two to Three Months. The sale process is likely to take two to three months. Vice expects to be given permission to keep paying employees wages and benefits, and to keep paying vendors and suppliers. Vice says its multiplatform media brands, including VICE, VICE News, VICE TV, VICE Studios, Pulse Films, Virtue, Refinery29 and i-D, will continue to operate. Its international entities, and the VICE TV joint venture with A&amp;E, are not part of the Chapter 11 filing. Vice began as a punk magazine in Montreal almost three decades ago, before expanding into digital media and TV striking deals with companies including Sky and HBO. The move into Chapter 11 follows sales talks with multiple companies in an attempt to avoid filing for bankruptcy, according to the New York Times earlier this month. Bruce Dixon and Hozefa Lokhandwala, VICE’s co-CEOs, explain: “This accelerated court-supervised sale process will strengthen the Company and position VICE for long-term growth, thereby safeguarding the kind of authentic journalism and content creation that makes VICE such a trusted brand for young people and such a valued partner to brands, agencies and platforms. We will have new ownership, a simplified capital structure and the ability to operate without the legacy liabilities that have been burdening our business. We look forward to completing the sale process in the next two to three months and charting a healthy and successful next chapter at VICE.” Related: Vice Media reportedly headed for bankruptcy Updated at 9.29am BST 8.04am BST Shares in Curry’s have jumped almost 6% at the start of trading, after it lifted its profit guidance this morning. They hit their highest level since early April, at 59.45p. 7.50am BST Introduction: UK tipped to avoid recession; Curry’s raises profit outlook Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Hopes that the UK will avoid recession this year are rising, after the economy performs better than expected so far this year. Forecasters at the EY Item Club have predicted this morning that the UK will grow by 0.2%% during 2023, rather than contracting as previously forecast. That improvement is due to falling inflation, lower-than-expected energy bills and a resilient jobs market, they say, with UK inflation expected to start falling sharply from its current double-digit levels. Anna Anthony, UK financial services managing partner at EY, comments: “We’re still on the path to economic recovery and many businesses and consumers – particularly the most vulnerable in society – continue to face significant cost-of-living pressures. This cannot be underestimated, and appropriate support must still be provided, but we are in a more optimistic place than we were a few months ago. The recession that many thought was inevitable is now likely to be avoided and energy prices have fallen, boosting consumer and business sentiment. This improving economic outlook means EY now expects higher bank lending this year, and next. Total UK bank loans to businesses and households are expected to rise 1.2% this year, upgraded from a 0.1% fall forecast in February, with further growth of 2.1% forecast for 2024. Anthony says economic conditions expected to improve over the course of 2023 and into 2024: “While encouraging, enthusiasm should be measured, in the short-term at least. UK banks continue to face a tough environment with historically low lending growth rates. However, the sector is in a strong capital position and continues to provide ongoing support to customers, businesses and the wider economy. On Friday, we learned that UK GDP grew by 0.1% in the first quarter of this year, a better outcome than feared a few months ago when high energy prices and the chaos of the mini-budget were hitting the economy. Interactive The Bank of England has also upgraded its forecasts last week, six months after warning that the UK faced the longest recession in half a century. Now, though, GDP is expected to be 2.25 percentage points higher than previously forecast over the next three years Electronics retailer Currys has added to the cheery mood this morning, by raising its profit outlook for the last financial year. It now expects to make adjusted pre-tax profits of £110-120m in the year ending 29 April, up from previous guidance of around £104m. Currys says that trading in the UK and Ireland has been “better than expectations, especially in the final two months of the year”. Profits have been bumped up by “continued gross margin improvements”, and cost efficiencies, it says. But, like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland were down 7% year-on-year, and fell 10% over the year in Nordic regions, where trading woes have hit the group. Currys says: Nordics trading environment remains challenging, but under new management we have made progress on margins and costs. Also coming up today Investors are watching Turkey closely, where yesterday’s election appears to be heading for a runoff. With the count continuing, neither president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan or his main rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu appear likely to reach the 50% threshold to win the presidential race outright.

    <head>Thai election may be turning point as taboo over monarchy fades</head>
    <body>Just a few years ago, talking publicly about the status or role of Thailand’s monarchy was taboo. But on Sunday night, a political party that had campaigned for reform of strict laws that shield the royal family from criticism came out on top in a general election, winning the most votes and seats, according to an unofficial count. Napon Jatusripitak, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, said it was an “extremely significant” moment. “They have the popular mandate – 14 million people voted for this party. And, of course, the party will proclaim this as a sign that Thailand has some readiness for more extensive structural reforms, no matter the institution.” According to the constitution, the monarchy is enshrined to be held in “revered worship”, and it is shielded from criticism by one of the world’s strictest lese-majesty laws. Saying anything deemed critical or offensive to the king, even in satire, can result in up to 15 years in prison. But for the first time, the lese-majesty law was discussed substantially by political parties in the run-up to an election, and Move Forward, which won the popular vote, is the only party that committed to reforming the law. It follows an unprecedented youth movement that took to the streets in 2020 to challenge that law and to call for the royal budget to be reduced and its political influence curbed. More than 240 people have since been charged with lese-majesty offences ranging from political speeches and Facebook posts to wearing fancy dress. Young protesters have often been bailed out by Move Forward’s politicians, and some even became candidates with the party in this election – and won seats. Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a professor and monarchy critic who lives in exile, described the election results as a “big turning point in Thailand’s political landscape”. An issue that “was once a taboo has now become mainstream”, he said. Implementing changes to the law would be difficult, however, given that Move Forward does not have a majority government, he added. The party has said it is ready to form a coalition, but it remains unclear whether it will be able to pass its plans through the unelected senate, which votes jointly on the future prime minister. Thailand’s 250 senators were entirely appointed by the military, an institution that vows to protect the monarchy, and which, along with judges and the wealthy, forms part of the powerful conservative royalist establishment. Move Forward’s predecessor, Future Forward, was shut down by the constitutional court in 2020, and its supporters fear that legal cases could be weaponised against it. An activist who goes by the name Sainam said that even with Move Forward’s strong numbers, its opponents could find ways to undermine the result. “I hope democracy will win but anything can happen. The election commission can do anything. We have 250 [senators]. Anything can happen … In this country, you can do anything,” he said as he watched results at Move Forward’s HQ on Sunday night. He was charged with lese-majesty for wearing a crop top at a protest with a message on his back that said his father’s name was not Vajiralongkorn. Thailand’s kings have been referred to as “father”, and intimate images of the current monarch, Maha Vajiralongkorn, wearing crop tops have appeared online and in European tabloids. Sainam was 16 at the time of his protest. He said he was awaiting a verdict in the case. Move Forward’s performance at the ballot box, just three years after it was started, has surprised many analysts. Napon said it was hard to disaggregate the reasons for its success, and it was unclear whether it was a vote for royal reform or if it reflected a broader desire for change. Other factors could have influenced the result, including a desire to see the back of Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who first took power in a coup in 2014, and a reluctance to vote for the opposition party Pheu Thai, which is associated with the divisive exiled prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The election results were a devastating blow for Prayuth, who styled himself as the protector of conservative Thai values. The leader of his United Thai Nation party, Pirapan Salirathavibhaga, had announced at one rally that “Thailand is the land for patriots … with the monarchy serving as the pillar of the country”, and promised to get tough with “nation haters”. Their party, however, performed poorly, finishing behind Move Forward and Pheu Thai in the popular vote.</body>

    <head>How Barcelona won La Liga: the story behind success for a new era</head>
    <body>In the end, no one could catch Barcelona, not even the Espanyol fans who chased them off the pitch and down the tunnel – although they got closer than anybody else. The banner at the RCDE Stadium on Sunday had declared “we are Espanyol and this is our life”, yet it wasn’t one they chose, still less one they liked. They had never seen their team win a derby in the place they made home, and this time not only did they witness another defeat that pushed them ever closer to a second relegation in three seasons, but the few who hadn’t left early also watched their rivals celebrate becoming champions in their own back garden. For some – morons, mostly – it was too much to take. Out there in the centre circle Barcelona were dancing a sardana, a ring of players and staff spinning, when suddenly they broke into a sprint instead. There had been no provocation and they hadn’t even been there three minutes, the coach Xavi Hernández already deciding it was enough, that this was neither the time nor the place and calling them to come in, when it happened. In the south stand, some Espanyol fans – a couple of hundred perhaps, many with faces covered – smashed barriers, climbed on to the pitch and began a stampede, heading for the players. Alerted just in time, Barça set off straight for the sideline, bundling in. Some fell as they went, others were caught up in it all, scared. As he ducked beyond the forming cordon, Frank Kessié smiled. Related: Barcelona seal La Liga title but invoke Espanyol fans’ wrath There, from behind police and security staff hurriedly trying – and not always succeeding – to block off the entrance to the tunnel, they watched missiles being thrown, chairs and bottles flying, and listened to the abuse. Some supporters turned to look up at the directors’ box and demanded resignations. One kicked over a TV camera; he, it turned out, was on the list for the Partido Popular at the municipal elections and is a kids’ coach. Inside, there were confrontations, players pushed back: Ronald Araújo and Sergio Busquets especially. “It’s a pity, but it’s football, it’s life,” Barcelona’s captain said. “What matters now is to celebrate, to be happy.” In the dressing room, they did and they were. The club president, Joan Laporta, barrelled in: rolling and bouncing about, suit soaked, tie tugged to one side, dirty kit thrown at him. Araújo, hair dyed blue and red – “I reckon I look nice like this” – was streaming on Instagram and Lionel Messi had joined the chat. Seven kilometres away, back towards the city, a crowd was building at Barcelona’s Joan Gamper training ground, first stop for the players who piled on to the balcony above. More supporters gathered around the Canaletes fountain, a traditional meeting point at the top of the Ramblas. What time’s the curfew, Xavi was asked. “Nah, tonight there’s freedom,” he said. “This deserves a big celebration.” On Monday evening, they will take a bus through the city alongside their all-conquering women’s team. Back in August 2019, Messi expressed his hope that one day people would realise how hard it is to win the league. Barcelona had won their eighth in 11 years four months before that, but there had been no bus. Anfield was coming up and the domestic title was, well, assumed. The night they clinched it, the players wore T-shirts saying, “the extraordinary thing is that it seems normal”. This time was different. They had seen, been reminded, how hard it can be to win a league, learned to love it. This was extraordinary, full stop, and no longer normal; this is the first time Barcelona have won the title since then. Barcelona fans celebrate in the street after their team won the title. Photograph: Joan Mateu Parra/AP Four years is not exactly an eternity, but it can feel like it. Especially when enough has happened for a decade anywhere else. And if this is the kind of “crisis” many clubs would crave, it is also real and this felt cathartic. The T-shirts they wore this time said: “The league is ours, the future too”. Over-optimistic, perhaps, but maybe there’s something in that, however small, and it spoke of an emotional need. “We’ve brought the happiness back,” Laporta said. This is Barcelona’s first league title without Messi this century. Halfway through the season, Gerard Piqué announced his retirement– he has been invited to join the celebrations – and Sergio Busquets will not continue, his ninth title to be his last. “I wanted to leave with this,” he said. Only four other squad members – Marc-André ter Stegen, Jordi Alba, Sergi Roberto, and Ousmane Dembélé – have won the league here. “This is important for the generation that’s coming,” Araújo said; “It’s the first for many of us,” Raphinha said. “If I had asked the journalists at the start of the season if we would win the league, and with an advantage like this, few would have said yes,” the Brazilian added. Real Madrid have failed to win three league games in a row since the World Cup and Atlético fell early, but it is not just about their failure to compete. If Barcelona’s double European capitulation and the 4-0 defeat to Madrid in the Copa del Rey semi-final inevitably invite questions, domestically their success is as incontestable as it is unexpected. Barcelona are 14 points clear with four games to spare. They have 85 points already, one point off the title-winning totals of Madrid and Atléti from the last two years, and could yet reach 97, the third-highest total ever. Barça have been top since October. Ultimately, nobody got near them. And yet if that makes it sound easy, like they have rolled over everyone, it has not been that either. Robert Lewandowski celebrates scoring the opening goal at Espanyol. Photograph: Lluís Gené/AFP/Getty Images This is a different Barcelona, a different era. It is still, Xavi insists, a team under construction but it is a side, he said, whose success has brought stability. Although that is not a point he drove home, it is an important one. This is a team that have won the league at a time of change and financial crisis, working within a club with €1bn debt, building work at the Camp Nou about to force them into exile at Montjuïc, and with the Negreira case as a backdrop, all the noise that has surrounded them. This is a club that needed to pull on the infamous palancas to build this squad in the first place – a risk some will consider vindicated now, at least short term – and still has a salary mass €250m too great, where new contracts for Gavi, Araújo, Marcos Alonso and Sergi Roberto can’t yet be formally registered. A club that Mateu Alemany, the director of football and architect of it all, is leaving at the end of June. All of which might be part of the reason why Barcelona have won it with their fans, noisily packing the Camp Nou with average crowds of at 84,000 – it is as if those problems, this new era, has made them more aware than ever they have a role to play, support to offer. It certainly has made them aware of the shortcomings and willing to seek solutions, new ones. When they lost the way they did at the Bernabéu in October, winning the league seemed implausible but they have competed like no one, including themselves. This may be the least Barcelona of all Barcelona teams, which makes winning the title feel even better – or at least more meritorious, overcoming obstacles that might have once been insurmountable. The clásico brought a shift, a “tactical variation” according to Busquets. Gavi played supposedly in the front three but was more part of a four-man box in the middle. “No one knows what to call his position,” Ter Stegen admitted, but whatever it was it worked. “We had brilliant games and others where we had to roll up our sleeves,” Busquets said. The words he used to describe Barcelona were: “solid”, “stable” and “solidario”, adding: “The defensive numbers were good.” Very, very good. With 21 goals scored, this has been Robert Lewandowski’s league, especially early in the season when AS described him as “a water diviner, some sort of mystic [who] had found an oasis in the desert”. It might have been Pedri’s too, and in terms of points and play he has been vital, although he has only started 22 of the 34 games. Dembélé started well – very much Xavi’s success, against the wishes of a club that wanted him gone – but then got injured, which is where Raphinha took over. But it was also Gavi’s league, as much for his feistiness as his football. And Busquets’s league, at 35. And Frenkie de Jong’s, after they had tried to force him out. It belonged to Alejandro Balde, a revelation; to Andreas Christensen, silently superb; and very definitely to Araújo, the man who had Xavi applauding a big hoof into the stands. When it came to the vital moment, it was Kessié’s league too, the president’s clásico goal in March all but ending the title race.It was certainly Ter Stegen’s league too, possibly more than anyone else. He was the one man unhappy at how Sunday night went, two insignificant goals irritating him: they were after all, a sixth of all those he has conceded all season, a symbol of the shift. At 88%, no one in Europe has saved more shots. On 25, no one has kept more clean sheets; one more and it will be an all-time record. He has let in 13, thirteen, in the league, on course for another record. Only two have been at the Camp Nou and they were a penalty and an own goal. On Sunday Barcelona scored four; on many nights it has been just one. A third of their games have finished 1-0. That title-winning feeling 🏆 pic.twitter.com/RxhyyDaM7w — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) May 15, 2023 “This is an extraordinary league, brutal, and we have to really value the way we did it: at times, we played very well, at others we showed we know how to suffer, how to be a block,” the coach said. That may not sound much like Xavi, the ultimate ideologue, defender of a footballing faith, but he has shown the intelligence and adaptability needed and together they have found a way. If there has been debate about their identity even while they won – proof, he says, that this is the hardest place there is – there can be none about the achievement. Despite being welcomed home as a hero, still few truly expected this. He took over at a time of crisis and changed the culture, an evolution begun and although he had won eight league titles as a player, this is his first as manager, loaded with a responsibility that goes beyond just the team and makes it different. Mallorca 1-0 Cádiz, Real Sociedad 2-2 Girona, Osasuna 3-1 Almería, Villarreal 5-1 Athletic, Real Madrid 1-0 Getafe, Celta Vigo 1-2 Valencia, Elche 1-0 Atlético Madrid, Valladolid 0-3 Sevilla, Espanyol 2-4 Barcelona. Monday: Real Betis v Rayo Vallecano So, he was asked, once the champions had escaped the stampede and were safely inside where the celebrations could begin properly, the title theirs four years on, is this Xavi’s league? “No,” he said, “it’s Barcelona’s.” Pos Team P GD Pts 1 Barcelona 34 51 85 2 Real Madrid 34 38 71 3 Atletico Madrid 34 33 69 4 Real Sociedad 34 14 62 5 Villarreal 34 17 57 6 Real Betis 33 3 52 7 Girona 34 6 48 8 Athletic Bilbao 34 6 47 9 Osasuna 34 -4 47 10 Sevilla 34 -5 47 11 Rayo Vallecano 33 -2 46 12 Mallorca 34 -4 44 13 Celta Vigo 34 -9 39 14 Valencia 34 -3 37 15 Almeria 34 -18 36 16 Cadiz 34 -24 35 17 Valladolid 34 -30 35 18 Getafe 34 -13 34 19 Espanyol 34 -18 31 20 Elche 34 -38 19</body>

    <head>Rick Perry hints at 2024 presidential bid and revives memories of debate gaffe</head>
    <body>The former Texas governor Rick Perry’s announcement on Sunday that he could mount a third run for the Republican presidential nomination encountered widespread mockery over a famous debate stage gaffe in which he forgot the name of a government department he said he would abolish. Related: Rick Perry tells Donald Trump: ‘You really are the chosen one’ But Perry, 73, also ran into stormier waters, being accused of lying regarding his alleged involvement in Donald Trump’s election subversion. Perry is the longest-serving Texas governor, in office between 2000 and 2015. A telegenic ex-air force pilot, he ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016. Both campaigns flopped but, speaking to CNN on Sunday, he said a third run was “something that I haven’t taken off the table”. In response, many observers pointed to Perry’s debate stage nightmare in Rochester, Michigan, in November 2011. Perry said then: “It’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone. Commerce, education, and the uh ... what’s the third one, there? Let’s see … Commerce, education and the, uh, um uh … The third agency of government I would do away with, uh, education, commerce, and, let’s see … I can’t. The third one. I can’t. “Oops.” ‘Oops.’ Rick Perry forgets own policy in Republican debate The third department turned out to be the Department of Energy, which Perry eventually led under Trump’s presidency. During his confirmation process, he told senators he regretted calling for the department to be eliminated. Trump now faces unprecedented legal jeopardy but enjoys commanding leads in Republican polling. On Sunday, Perry declined to endorse him. “He may get to hear me call him names again,” Perry said, a reference to the 2016 campaign which he quit after failing to qualify for a CNN debate featuring no fewer than 11 presidential hopefuls. He added: “It’s early in the process, I think, for any of us to sit back and say, ‘I’m for this person or that person.’ [A 2024 run] certainly is something that I haven’t taken off the table, but the chances of it happening are probably a little bit slim. “There’s a lot of time left, and we’ll see how this all works out.” Perry resigned as energy secretary in October 2019. To CNN, he denied complicity in Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. In 2021 it was reported, first by CNN, that congressional investigators believed Perry texted Mark Meadows, Trump’s final chief of staff, recommending that Republican-held state legislatures disregard wins for Joe Biden. Perry on Sunday told CNN: “I didn’t send it, and that’s kind of the interesting thing. As a matter of fact, if you go back and look at the congressional testimony, the congressman who brought that up said later, you know what, we’re not really sure where this came from.” In December 2021, the text in question was read on the House floor by Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sat on the House January 6 committee. Raskin initially said the text was sent by a “House lawmaker” but according to CNN, “learned of the error … from CNN” as it reported Perry’s alleged authorship. On Sunday, Perry added: “I got called on [the texts] a couple times. Number one, it’s not my style of speak, or texting, so to speak. So again, there is a lot of misinformation out there … and that was one piece of it. So I can assure you that that didn’t come from me.” The Guardian contacted Raskin for comment. Another January 6 committee member, however, rejected Perry’s claim not to have sent the tweet in question. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican now retired from Congress, tweeted: “Well, that’s a lie because he did.”</body>

    <head>‘Erdoğan is too nationalistic’: readers on their vote in Turkey’s election</head>
    <body>Turkey will go to the polls again in a fortnight after neither of the leading candidates managed to secure 50% of the vote in the country’s presidential elections on Sunday. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of the Justice and Development party (AKP) received 49.51% of the vote, the head of the country’s election council said, while his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the Republican People’s party (CHP), gained 44.88%. The third-placed candidate, the ultra-nationalist Sinan Oğan, won 5.17%. Related: Turkey election results 2023: what we know so far Analysts have said it could be difficult for Kılıçdaroğlu to make up Erdoğan’s five-point lead in the fortnight before the second round. Many supporters of Kılıçdaroğlu who contacted the Guardian said they backed him in order to force an end to Erdoğan’s rule, while some expressed concern about his anti-Syrian rhetoric. Other readers said they continued to support Erdoğan, seeing him as a powerful leader with authority on the world stage. ‘I want better relations with the west’ It was a hard decision for me but at the end I voted for Kılıçdaroğlu. In the second round both candidates have equal chances, I believe. I want Erdoğan to go. To me he did good so far but it is time to go. I voted for Erdoğan in 2018 and he did good things for Turkey – he completed many important infrastructure projects. But he is too aggressive on foreign policy. I want better relations with the west. Erdoğan is too nationalistic – he is dreaming of Ottoman times. But in the parliamentary elections, I will vote for AKP. AKP has liberal policies both in economy and in society. I am also concerned the fight against the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) may falter [if] Kılıçdaroğlu wins.” Şerif, 58, software developer in Ankara Related: Turkey election: what can we expect from Erdoğan v Kılıçdaroğlu runoff? ‘The CHP is against Syrians’ I supported Erdoğan. I was born in Syria and have Turkish origin. I have lived here for seven years and have acquired Turkish citizenship a few years ago after going through the legal system. The opposition considers me an enemy. I am a very liberal person who would have considered voting for them if they actually tried to win me over and didn’t show hatred against migrants. I am very annoyed by the round two vote – I would have preferred a round one victory for either side. The 5% that voted for the third candidate are ultra-nationalists. My main concern is xenophobia and racial discrimination. If [they] are the ones to decide that means the game will be on who gives more to them. I hate to imagine they will get a big say in who the president of Turkey will be. Doctor in İzmir, 34 ‘Erdoğan is a well-known statesman’ I voted for Erdoğan because he brought Turkey together with roads, high-speed trains and technology in 20 years. He challenged the imperialist western countries. He is [one of] the most well-known statesmen in the world. Turkey, for the first time, rebelled against the [west] thanks to Erdoğan and succeeded. Kılıçdaroğlu cannot stand up against these countries. He will drag the country into chaos. Erdoğan [has] charisma, courage and success. What he has done is the guarantee of what he will do. Hüseyin, 69, retired teacher in Düzce ‘Freedom has been eroded under the AKP’ I knew it would be a long night then but I was expecting Kılıçdaroğlu to be in the lead. AKP never fights fair but the opposition needed to chip into Erdoğan’s vote. This ultimately united the right wing. Our democracy, currency, freedoms and justice have eroded after 21 years of AKP rule. The presidential system has crushed our economy further and this has to stop. For the parliamentary vote I [voted] for the Workers’ party of Turkey (TİP) even though I am not a hard-leftist. They have been a voice to many underrepresented people and CHP’s list is replete with former AKP members who are still openly Islamists and I find that nauseating. I am concerned that AKP and Erdoğan are capable of intimidation. I have witnessed first-hand how far they can go during Gezi protests during which I and my friends were almost crushed to death by the police. Önder, 35, teacher in Istanbul ‘Erdoğan connects everything to religion’ I support Kılıçdaroğlu and also I want to get rid of Erdoğan. My generation was raised under his [rule]. The economy is very bad. He connects everything to religion. He is against women, he is against [secular] education, he is against alcohol. I earn a good salary [compared with] the rest of the population but even [then] it’s not enough. I pay half of my salary for apartment rent. Right now going on holiday in Europe is cheaper than in Antalya and Bodrum. And there is an earthquake that we shouldn’t forget – the government [was slow] to send rescue. I voted for the economy, freedom, LGBT, women’s rights, animal rights, and for our future. Trade manager in Istanbul, 37 ‘CHP is pro-European’ I voted for Kılıçdaroğlu because Erdoğan and his system and party are not doing any good for the country. The CHP is leftist and represents my worldview. They are pro-European and we are hoping them to change the country’s direction to EU again. After 21 years of ruling the party, Erdoğan has too much power in the country and his last wish is to lose. Therefore, there are concerns about the safety of voting and his acceptance process if he is defeated. Yusuf, 34, marketing professional in Mersin ‘The second round is merely a formality’ My reaction to the result is that it was incredibly bad. A first-round win would have been a surprise but a result behind Erdoğan, and with a 4% loss, is incredible. Kılıçdaroğlu may not be inspirational but he is an honest man who has succeeded in bringing a diverse opposition together. Erdoğan controls the media and is against women. [I think] Erdoğan’s economic policies are stupid beyond belief. Nobody saw this coming from the opposition side. I don’t understand how some in the liberal media and opposition are still saying all isn’t lost. The second round is merely a formality in my opinion. Eda, 37, works in tourism in Istanbul</body>

    <head>Center Parcs UK owner seeks double what it paid with near-£5bn price tag</head>
    <body>Center Parcs’ UK and Irish business is being put up for sale with a price tag of up to £5bn – double the amount it was bought for in 2015 – as its private equity owners seek to cash in on the trend for domestic breaks kickstarted by the Covid pandemic. The potential sale comes after the group – whose five resorts in the UK and one in Ireland are known for their tropical-themed indoor pools, spas and activities for kids and their sometimes eye-watering fees – bounced back to a profit after being forced to close outlets under pandemic restrictions. Sales more than quadrupled to £503m in the year to 21 April 2022, helping lift profits to £66m, from a loss of a £157m the prior year as visitors sought out holidays close to home amid ongoing global travel disruption. The group had hoped to build a new site in Worth Forest, West Sussex, but pulled out earlier this year after an outcry from wildlife campaigners. A potential sale comes as private equity haspiled into the UK’s domestic holiday market amid hopes for growth prompted by the fall in the value of the pound, the cost of living crisis, environmental concerns and more interest in outdoor pursuits after a shift among Britons towards breaks in the UK prompted by pandemic travel restrictions. Bourne Leisure, which includes caravan park operator Haven Holidays, was bought by the private equity group Blackstone for about £3bn in January 2021. That same year CVC Capital Partners bought the holiday park operator Away Resorts for £250m and then bought up Aria Resorts and Coppergreen Leisure to combine with it. Advisers to Brookfield Property Partners have been sounding out potential buyers for Center Parcs over the past week, according to the Financial Times which first reported the sale move, with possible suitors expected to include other private equity firms. Center Parcs has been operating in the UK since 1987 when it opened in Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, followed by a site in Elveden Forest in Suffolk in 1989. However, the group’s roots go back to 1967 when a Dutch businessman, Piet Derksen, opened a holiday village at De Lommerbergen, called Sporthuis Centrum – with accommodation in the form of tents. The business gradually shifted from canvas to lodges and was renamed Center Parcs before the UK arm was split off from the European division in 2001. Center Parcs continues to operate in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Belgium under separate ownership. If Brookfield achieves the hoped-for price it would book a substantial profit after it acquired Center Parcs’s UK-centred arm from Blackstone for about £2.4bn in 2015. However, property-based transactions have since been hit by fears about rising interest rates and the general economic outlook. Center Parcs got into hot water last autumn when it announced it would close its UK sites for 24 hours to mark the Queen’s funeral and any guests in the middle of stays would have to vacate the resorts overnight. It quickly backtracked, issuing a statement saying it had “reviewed our position regarding the very small number of guests who are not due to depart … we will be allowing them to stay on our villages rather than having to leave and return”.</body>

    <head>Company directors jailed after wall collapse killed five workers in Birmingham</head>
    <body>Two company directors have been jailed for nine months after five workers died when a wall collapsed at a scrap metal recycling plant in Birmingham. Wayne Hawkeswood and Graham Woodhouse were in charge of the site when the 45-tonne wall collapsed in July 2016 in the Nechells area of the city, and were each found guilty of four health and safety offences. Their companies, Hawkeswood Metal Recycling and Ensco 10101 – named Shredmet at the time of the wall collapse, were fined £1m and £600,000 respectively for two health and safety breaches. The five victims – Almamo Jammeh, Ousmane Diaby, Bangally Dukureh, Saibo Sillah and Mahamadou Jagana – were all killed instantly and had to be identified by their fingerprints. A sixth man suffered serious leg injuries, having just stepped outside the bay before the wall came down. A six-week trial at Birmingham crown court heard the wall had 263 tonnes of briquettes piled up against it causing it to become overloaded and fall on to the men who were clearing a bay on the other side. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found the wall had previously been taken down then reassembled, and the combined weight of the machine-pressed metal briquettes was the equivalent of six fully loaded HGVs. A neighbouring company raised concerns about walls leaning from the site at least two years before the men were killed, the jury were told. Passing sentence on Monday, Mr Justice Sweeting said evidence suggested the “wall must have been teetering on the brink of falling” before the collapse and the “final force which caused this massively heavy wall to fall over might have been nothing more than a gust of wind”. In a statement following the sentencing, the families of the victims said: “We welcome and are relieved at the decision to convict and send to prison both directors of the company, as well as imposing on them a huge fine. We miss Ousmane, Saibo, Bangally, Almamo and Mahamadou every single day. “On the day they died we made each of them a promise that we would secure justice. It has been a long and difficult road to get to this point. But we can now rest easier as our promise has been kept.” The families said they were frustrated they had to wait so long to see justice, and previously told the Guardian they felt as if “our lives do not matter”. The judge ordered Hawkeswood to pay a third of costs totalling £775,000, with the two companies to pay 20% each, and Woodhouse deemed unable to contribute. Sweeting said that he accepted both men were of good character, the case had taken a personal toll on them and they “have expressed genuine remorse” for the deaths, but concluded a custodial sentence was unavoidable. The HSE principal inspector, Amy Kalay, said: “I hope the families and friends of the men who died find some comfort in today’s sentencing. “The investigation into this incident was long and complex. Five men lost their lives in the most appalling of circumstances. Their deaths should not have happened. They went to work to earn a wage; that cost them their lives.”</body>

    <head>Cynthia Erivo to star in movie adaptation of hit play Prima Facie</head>
    <body>Cynthia Erivo is set to star in a big-screen adaptation of award-winning one-woman play Prima Facie. According to Variety, the Oscar-nominated star of Harriet will take on the lead role that Jodie Comer played in the West End before recently transferring to Broadway. The show first opened in Australia in 2020. The play centres on barrister Tessa, who discovers she is part of a corrupt legal system when she is the victim of sexual assault. The film adaptation will be directed by Susanna White, whose credits include Jessica Chastain drama Woman Walks Ahead and episodes of Andor. Suzie Miller will expand upon her original stage script. “Tessa’s experience sheds such vulnerable light on the complex conversations around consent and sexual abuse and the law that surrounds it, which is all too relatable for so many and timely for all,” Erivo said to Variety. Comer’s lauded performance won her the best actress Olivier award and recently nabbed her a Tony nomination. The Guardian’s Arifa Akbar praised the Killing Eve actor for her ability to “infuse breath-taking emotional drama in every last word”. “Jodie Comer’s powerhouse exploration of that struggle on Broadway is nothing short of beautiful and heart-wrenching,” Erivo said. Erivo won the 2016 Tony award for best actress in a musical for her performance in The Color Purple, before embarking on a film career including roles in Widows, Bad Times at the El Royale, Chaos Walking and Pinocchio. She received a best actress Oscar nomination for her role as Harriet Tubman in Harriet. Next year she will be seen alongside Ariana Grande in a film adaptation of musical Wicked.</body>

    <head>Toronto mayor’s race draws more than 100 candidates – including one dog</head>
    <body>More than 100 candidates, including a former police chief, a comedian and a dog, are all vying for the chance to be mayor of Canada’s largest city. One hundred and two prospective mayors formally registered before Friday’s deadline as candidates in the mayoral byelection at the end of June. Related: Toronto dog owners bite back after city posts ‘no barking’ sign at pooch park The current three-term mayor, John Tory, abruptly resigned in February, after admitting to an extramarital affair with a former staff member. Tory had won re-election only four months before. The deputy mayor, Jennifer McKelvie, has served as interim mayor since Tory’s departure and is not running as a candidate. Olivia Chow, who placed third in the 2014 mayoral election that Tory won, is seen as the current frontrunner, ahead of former provincial lawmaker Mitzie Hunter, councillors Ana Bailão, Brad Bradford and Josh Matlow and former police chief Mark Saunders. Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, who previously said he wouldn’t weigh in on the election, has tacitly endorsed Saunders. “We need someone who has experience dealing with crime. I believe we need someone that has actually run an operation with a number of employees that has the experience,” said Ford. “We need someone in Toronto that knows all of Toronto, not a little ward that they’ve been representing, but all of Toronto.” Leading candidates are campaigning on fixing Toronto’s transit system, addressing a cost of living crisis in the city and overhauling controversial infrastructure, like the Gardiner expressway. But the record number of entrants has also lured in a cast of long-shot hopefuls. One of the last candidates to register was Molly, a seven-year-old Russian rescue dog. Owner Toby Heaps, who arrived at city hall on rollerblades, said he was a stand-in for the dog. He told reporters Molly’s biggest concerns were the city’s use of winter road salt, which hurts her paws. He also said a victory for Molly would lead to more “civilized discourse” during council meetings. “You’ve probably noticed when you have an animal in the room, people are more human.” Another candidate, grade 12 student Meir Straus, promised on his campaign website he is “definitely a real man and NOT three raccoons in a trench coat”. Meir (pronounced “mayor”), says his focus will be on “weed-smell, roundabouts, organ-shortages, Canada geese, God, labour, street preachers, hipsters, uncomfortable benches”, adding that he’s the youngest candidate, so he won’t die in office. He also says because he’s not married, he can’t have any affairs. Early voting begins 8 June until 13 June, with election day 26 June.</body>

    <head>True equality is an idea the Tories just don’t get</head>
    <body>Justine Greening’s oft-proposed bromide to solve problems of public finances, growth and productivity through the removal of inequality of opportunity is no more than a soft-soap UK variant of the American dream (What’s the big idea that could win the Conservatives the next election? Social mobility, 12 May). In the US, so the argument goes, if you work hard you will make it. The corollary of course is that if (and probably when) you don’t make it, you didn’t work hard enough – it was your fault. Without addressing the underlying structural problems of inequality – in health, housing, transport and education – any Tory panacea of equality of opportunity is simply a device to get a few strivers to the top of the pile, while leaving the structural inequalities still in place. If you make it, that’s great, and if you don’t, well you can’t complain as you had an equal chance to succeed. It is fantasy to suppose that social mobility will deal with the UK’s chronic economic and social problems. Levelling up is a conveniently vague phrase and perhaps some “red wall” voters thought it meant social mobility. Many more, I suspect, thought it meant fixing glaring failures in public provision. Most voters care little about the opportunity to be CEO of, say, a water or train company and make a pile of money. The things they care far more about include clean rivers and an efficient public transport system – along with all the other enablers and benefits that a thriving G7 economy must provide, such as healthcare and affordable housing. Perhaps the real problem for the current generation of Conservatives is that they are unable to see the role that the state can play in driving the economy through capital investment and a sustained industrial strategy. They want to be in office, but they don’t want to govern; small-state thinkers in a big-state universe. As the UK continues to lose pace with the rest of the G7 and the Brexit promises become more visibly hollow, let us hope that a better alternative comes sooner rather than later. Henry Thompson Harrogate, North Yorkshire • Justine Greening is right to recognise a fundamental lack of equality of opportunity in the UK. But for a party ideologically opposed to public services and ideologically committed to enriching a small percentage of the population at the expense of the rest, inequality is struck through it like a stick of Blackpool rock. The Conservative party would love the next general election to be fought on vision and ideas rather than on record, but Greening fails to acknowledge that delivery of equality of opportunity would by its very nature require a superordinate change in the culture of the party. Philip Smith Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire • Justine Greening’s cause is important, but anyone who believes the 2019 election was about social mobility is deluded. It was entirely about Brexit and “getting it done”. Levelling up is a valid cause and should receive both focus and funding, but it is not what the next election will be about. The next election will be about the cost of living and the NHS – two things where the party’s record is left wanting. The election after next, levelling up may get some traction. For the forthcoming election, the focus should be on undoing the dreadful harm of the previous Tory governments. Ben Kenyon London</body>

    <head>Rainbow sea slug found in Falmouth rock pool indicates warming sea</head>
    <body>Vicky Barlow was hoping to find a spider crab when she began poking around a rock pool on a beach in Falmouth. But when she turned over a promising-looking stone, she was astonished to find something much rarer and much more colourful – a rainbow sea slug. Though the creature – Babakina anadoni – has been spotted off the UK shores by divers and snorkellers, it is believed to be the first time one has been found in a rock pool. It is not a completely happy story, however, as the appearance of the animal, which is more often found in Spain, Portugal and France, is almost certainly a sign of warming waters caused by the climate emergency. Barlow, a graphic designer by trade, was volunteering with the Cornwall-based rock pool project when, at the end of a busy day, she decided to take one more look in the pools. “I decided to hang behind in hopes of finding a spider crab. We often come across these magnificent creatures in the low shore pools. I soon found a large edible crab, a green sea urchin and multiple cushion stars.” Barlow had a pasty and a cold drink waiting – but took one more look in a larger pool. “When you have been rock pooling as much as I have been in the last year, you start to get an eye for which rocks are most likely to have something interesting underneath. The last rock I picked up was exactly one of these. “It was quite a large, heavy rock, covered in various seaweeds, and once lifted something extremely bright and unusual caught my eye.” She knew at once it was a rainbow sea slug. “The beautiful animal unfurled and revealed itself in full Technicolor,” she said. Barlow took some pictures and video of the creature before gently putting it back where she found it. Dr Ben Holt, CEO of the Rock Pool Project, said: “As far as we can tell, this is the first time this species has been found by a rock pooler in the UK. It’s a warm-water species but it looks as if it’s arrived here.” Holt said the organisation was seeing “striking changes” around the coast because of the climate emergency.</body>

    <head>Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me review – sympathetic retelling of a tragic life</head>
    <body>The strange, sad story of Anna Nicole Smith is retold in this Netflix documentary by Ursula Macfarlane, who made Untouchable, about Harvey Weinstein. Smith was the former Playboy centrefold and Guess Jeans model who wound up dead of a drug overdose in 2007 at the age of 39, soon after her 20-year-old son had tragically died the same way. There are eerie similarities with the life of Pamela Anderson, also a recent Netflix subject, though Anderson survives and thrives. Smith was a smalltown Texas girl from a tough background – although she was accused by her mother of manufacturing abuse stories for publicity. She embraced Playboy superstardom, tabloid notoriety and media letching that so easily flipped over into misogynist hate. Like Anderson, Smith used the “blonde” image as a kind of persona or disguise or armour and (as with Anderson) it is strange to see her pre- or non-blonde normality from private photos. Smith started out as a dancer in a Texas strip club, having already had a baby from a rash teenage marriage; one of the customers in the club was 86-year-old oil billionaire J Howard Marshall who became infatuated with Smith, showered her with money and gifts, and finally married her – to the rage of his grownup son Pierce, who succeeded in ringfencing the old man’s entire estate in a trust so Smith could get none of the money after his death. It is an incredible story, although, frustratingly, this movie is too coy to just ask the Mrs Merton question: what first attracted her to the billionaire oil baron? Oddly, the film cites Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes – and Anna Nicole’s life is an amazing real-life revival of that story – but doesn’t quote Marilyn’s classic, impenitent line: “Don’t you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty? You may not love your girl just because she’s pretty, but my goodness doesn’t it help?” This documentary uses a great deal of existing archive interview material (though annoyingly without giving provenance) including what appears to be Playboy TV footage of her reality-TV-style meeting with her long-estranged dad, who had left home when she was a baby, together with a half-brother; neither of them knew who she had become before their reunion. A more facetious film would have wondered about the circumstances in which these two men might already have been familiar with Smith’s image, as Christopher Hitchens did in his vignette for Vanity Fair. But this film suggests, grimly, that this estranged dad then tried to assault her. In the end, Smith was a prisoner of her image, of the paparazzi celeb industry, and her own abuse of alcohol and drugs, having got addicted to pain pills after her breast enhancement operation (a gruesomely metaphoric event). It’s an effective retelling, though the film could have concentrated more on her tragicomic relationship with her oil plutocrat husband. Could it actually have been a love story after all? • Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me is released on 16 May on Netflix.</body>

    <head>Did you solve it? Succession</head>
    <body>Earlier today I set you these six puzzles about succession with a lower case ‘s’. Here they are again with solutions. 1. Nob job This is a masterpiece by the Japanese creator Nob Yogishahara, one of my favourite puzzles of all time. What number goes in the circle with the ‘?’? (No, the 7 in the final circle is not a mistake.) Solution: 12 The rule is that you need to add the digits of the two numbers that point to the same circle. Thus, from top left, 7 + 2 + 9 + 9 = 27, and so on. What’s great with this puzzle is that the obvious answer – that you take the difference between the two numbers pointing to the same circle – seems to work beautifully, until you get to the final circle, since 21 – 13 is not 7. 2. Think Roman For this question and the following ones, what number comes next? 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 9, 5, 1, 1, 0, 55, ... Hint: write out one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, ... and look at the title of this puzzle. Solution: 55 Roman numerals use the letters ‘i’, ‘v’, ‘x’, ‘l’, ‘c’ and ‘m’. Read only these letters, and treat them as if they are a Roman numeral. ‘Five’ is IV, ‘six’ is IX and so on. ‘Twelve’ is thus ‘‘LV’. 3. Golomb’s sequence. 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, ... Named after the eminent mathematician Solomon Golomb (whose work inspired the game Tetris), this is an extremely pleasing pattern once you spot it. Hint: think about why are there two 2s and two 3s. Solution: 9. The sequence follows this rule: The value of the number in position n is the number of appearances of the number n. Thus there is a single 1, two 2s, two 3s, three 4s, three 5s, four 6s…and five 9s. 4. The elevator sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, … Another puzzle is why this sequence got its name. Solution: 23. The sequence has every whole number except 13. Another description might be “Elevator numbers in many buildings” since in Western countries the absence of a 13th floor is widespread for superstitious reasons. 5. The flagpole sequence What number comes next, i.e after THIRTEEN? Solution: FOUR It’s called the flagpole sequence for a reason! The flagpole (illustrated below) reads out the numbers in the list. So the next number must have a R in it since we can see that the next letter in the flagpole must be an R. Inspecting the previous numbers, we can see that numbers are never repeated, and the lowest acceptable number is always used. The lowest unused number with an R is four, which is the answer. 6. Eban numbers 2, 4, 6, 30, 32, 34, 36, 40, 42, 44, 46, 50, 52, 54, 56, 60, 62, 64, 66... Solution 2,000 Again, the clue is in the name. If you ban all number words that include the letter ‘e’, you get this sequence…and rather wonderfully the successor to 66 is a long way down the line! I hope you enjoyed the puzzles, I’ll be back in two weeks. Thanks to the Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences and Eric Angelini for inspiring today’s puzzles. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. I give school talks about maths and puzzles (online and in person). If your school is interested please get in touch.</body>

    <head>A just and democratic society that benefits all: that’s what Palestinians are fighting for</head>
    <body>For us Palestinians, 15 May marks the 75th anniversary of the Nakba (the “catastrophe” of 1948), during which about 70% of the Palestinian population was forcibly displaced and more than 500 communities were wiped out completely, in addition to the massacres committed by Zionist militias. The Nakba of 1948 marked the destruction of the indigenous Palestinian population’s way of life and the establishment of the state of Israel. In the 1967 war, another important turning point, Israel occupied the remaining 22% of historic Palestine. Yet, in successfully gaining control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel inadvertently unified Palestinians who joined a common struggle for freedom, self-determination, and the right of return to the lands that so many had been violently forced to flee. Certain Israeli leaders even warned of the consequences of maintaining the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The illegal Israeli occupation gradually transformed into a system of apartheid. According to Ronnie Kasrils, who was one of the Jewish leaders of the anti-apartheid struggle and a member of Nelson Mandela’s government, Israeli apartheid in Palestine is even worse than the apartheid that used to exist in South Africa. Related: Gaza fighting enters fourth day as hopes raised of truce brokered by Egypt This includes illegal colonial settlements supported by religious-nationalist fanatics like the national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, and the financeminister, Bezalel Smotrich – the latter has openly referred to himself as a “fascist homophobe”. Occupation led to apartheid and apartheid produced fascists. In 1993, the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) accepted the creation of a state on only 22% of historic Palestine. But, as we have learned bitterly through the experience of the Oslo Accords, the compromise of Palestinians has not improved the situation for our people. Thirty years after signing the Oslo agreement between the PLO and Israel, the “two-state solution” is dead because of Israel’s continuous colonisation and de-facto annexation of Palestinian land. This includes dozens of illegal settlements, the construction of a segregation wall (most of which was built on Palestinian land), and an Israeli political discourse that stresses there will only be one state – a “Jewish state” – between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea. It is clear that the Oslo agreements are no longer viable, and that the Palestinian Authority (PA), having been weakened and delegitimised by Israel, is isolated and severely unpopular among the general Palestinian population. Despite all these difficulties, the younger Palestinian generation is determined to continue with the struggle for freedom. A growing number of Palestinians believe that the only solution left is a single democratic state on the whole of historic Palestine without occupation, apartheid or discrimination. For decades, there have been Palestinian leaders and activists who have called for the establishment of one democratic state in Palestine where Jews and Palestinians can live together with equal rights. In recent years, even as Israel’s consolidation of apartheid has become increasingly blatant, Europe and the United States have continued to pressure Palestinians to accept a two-state solution that perpetuates inequality and suffering, with no regard to our right to self-determination and without any serious effort to stop settlement building. Nothing can justify settler colonialism that is harmful to both the Palestinian and Jewish peoples. Confronted with a project aimed at the elimination of the Palestinians as a nation, we have remained resilient, determined not to give up our homeland. We remain committed to the fight for freedom, and to a struggle for the creation of a just and democratic society that benefits all people without discrimination. Today, 75 years after the Nakba, more than 6 million Palestinian refugees are unable to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the number of Palestinians in the land of historic Palestine is at least equal to the number of Jewish Israelis. This painful anniversary, and horrendous present reality, must compel western policymakers and civil society leaders to think outside stale paradigms. We cannot change the past, but the only solution for a post-apartheid future is a single democratic state where all citizens have equal rights and equal duties.

    <head>We’re witnessing the end of our right to protest</head>
    <body>These are worrying times (The coronation arrests are just the start. Police can do what they want to us now, 12 May). When I policed protest, across 30 years of service (1986-2016), in a variety of roles that included holding a riot shield myself, the police were simply there to protect life and property. We were the visible safety barrier between the protesters and those they were protesting against. We allowed them both to be heard. Paul Phillips Retired chief superintendent • Andy Beckett (Is there a future for protest in Britain? Standing in the muted republican crowd, my fears only grew, theguardian.com, 11 May) mentions the past suppression of protest by the practice of “kettling” – corralling protesters in a confined space for hours. As a human rights solicitor in 2005, I challenged this practice by means of a judicial review. I instructed Keir Starmer QC (as he then was) to appear for our clients. We lost the case. The judge who decided the case was Mr Justice Tugendhat, father of the MP Tom Tugendhat, who is now security minister. In 2012, the European court of human rights upheld his decision. There is a long history of suppression of protest in this country. Louise Christian London • Civicus.org, an organisation that monitors liberties and freedom across the globe, recently downgraded the UK from “narrowed” to “obstructed”, as our freedoms become increasingly diminished. This puts us on a par with Poland and Hungary. The passive acceptance of the ongoing threat to our freedoms by too many of the population is a desperate indictment of our situation. John Barnett Stewkley, Buckinghamshire • In 1957, when as an 11-year-old I arrived with my parents in this country to find safe haven as refugees from Soviet-occupied Hungary, the sight of a friendly bobby on street corners taught me to not be afraid of authority. Today, at the age of 78, having never knowingly committed a single law infringement in my life, I nevertheless have to fear being arrested if I as much as take part in a peaceful demonstration. My parents would turn in their graves. Elizabeth Morley Aberystwyth, Ceredigion • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

    <head>How nature’s larder is depleted by foraging</head>
    <body>Every time we forage, we damage the habitat and food supply for wildlife that is already under pressure from humans and climate change (Excessive foraging for wild garlic and mushrooms in UK ‘a risk to wildlife’ 13 May). I live on the edge of parkland in Bristol. This is a great resource for people and wildlife, particularly since more of the space has been allowed to rewild. However, it is a finite resource. For local wildlife – foxes, badgers, birds and insects – the park is their home and their larder. Each time I pick a blackberry, which I confess to doing, I’m depleting this larder. My wife and I have witnessed the wholesale clearing of sloes, damsons, wild garlic and elderflowers. If foraging can help control Japanese knotweed, that’s welcome, but otherwise we should be more thoughtful about the impact of our plundering. As for commercial-scale foraging, I’m put in mind of commercial whaling and the wild fur trade. Look where those activities took us.

    <head>Feeling lonely? Try a university challenge</head>
    <body>Re loneliness (Editorial, 8 May), I would recommend U3A (University of the Third Age) to anyone no longer in work, whether they were lonely or not. I moved to a new area knowing no one locally. I was made welcome and quickly made friends. There are 1,035 branches of U3A across the UK and the average cost of membership is £20 a year. It provides a wide range of activities and opportunities to meet up for company and fun. Janet Hawkins Uttoxeter, Staffordshire • In response to Gaby Hinsliff’s piece on generations sharing a home (Britain’s nimby homeowners: do you really want your children living with you for ever? 12 May), we shared a fairly modest terraced house with four generations of family.

    <head>2025 Rugby League World Cup in doubt after France pull out of staging event</head>
    <body>The 2025 Rugby League World Cup is in serious doubt after the hosts, France, confirmed they would not be able to stage the tournament. France had been preparing to be sole hosts of the event for the first time since they held it in 1972, but have pulled out after funding cuts from the French government. The government had demanded a guarantee concerning the possibility of the tournament making a loss. Conditions initially set to secure the economic viability of the event were not fulfilled and, despite being given additional time to secure funding, the organising committee was unable to do so. That left them unable to commit to hosting and plummeting into doubt the biggest event in world rugby league. Related: Kevin Sinfield carries Rob Burrow over the line at Leeds Marathon The International Rugby League will now convene at a board meeting this summer to consider alternative options for host nations in 2025. That could include New Zealand or a possible joint bid from Pacific nations including Samoa and Tonga, though the latter is unlikely because of the logistical implications required to stage a tournament at such short notice. The Guardian understands England will almost certainly not bid, with the significant government funding that helped to stage the tournament last year unlikely to be repeated again so soon. Troy Grant, the chair of the IRL, said: “The Rugby League World Cup in France in 2025 was always an ambitious project given the unprecedented short lead‑in time due to the pandemic. However, it had the advantage of following and leveraging off the widely acknowledged RLWC2021 success. “The factors that impacted on the bid team’s ability to complete the early structure of the tournament, such as the economic crisis and, in particular, inflationary pressure on host town council budgets, undermined their ability to secure adequate securities for the event to satisfy the government’s strict conditional benchmarks put forward from the beginning of the process for the tournament to proceed. “I respect the French government’s decision amid the challenges they are facing but I can’t hide my disappointment. We will now accelerate our consideration of other contingency options.” The tournament was expected to be the biggest in history, played across 40 venues with men’s, women’s, wheelchair and youth events running alongside one another. But with such a short space of time until the event was due to take place, the prospect of the World Cup being pushed back to 2026 seems increasingly likely.</body>

    <head>Dog rescued after scaling England’s highest mountain</head>
    <body>A mountain rescue team has praised the “cool, calm and positively regal” demeanour of the subject of a weekend callout: an injured and exhausted dog who got up England’s highest peak but refused to come down. Rocky the akita and its owners successfully climbed Scafell Pike in the Lake District on Saturday. The trouble began on the way down towards Langdale, Keswick mountain rescue team said. The dog was exhausted, had a cut paw and was “refusing to move”. A call for help was made at about 6.25pm on Saturday and 13 volunteers from the mountain rescue team sprang into action. They eventually met up with Rocky and its owners, who were starting to feel the cold. After making the dog comfortable, they sledged and carried it down the mountain to safety. “Despite being quite a large dog at 33kg it was a joy to carry such a relatively lightweight casualty,” a spokesperson said. It “remained cool, calm and positively regal throughout”. After the rescue team posted the incident on its Facebook page there was a mixed reaction. “Tut, tut, tut,” said one person. “Well done to all involved but the dog’s owners have a lot to answer for.” Dogs are not meant to be walking on the fells and the climb was obviously too difficult, they said. This led to a spirited defence of the dog and taking them on fell walks. “No judgment please,” said one person, pointing out the dog may have been tired because it was injured. “Great job,” said another. “I have an American akita myself and all I can say is not at all surprised. Very independent and stubborn dogs and if they say that’s enough then that’s enough.” Another recalled the day her 32kg labradoodle “went on strike” nine miles into a 10-mile coastal walk in Anglesey. They ended up calling a taxi and “£35 later and back at my car, said labradoodle recovered and starting doing zoomies around the car”.</body>

    <head>‘The Velvet Hammer’: who is Twitter’s new CEO and can she fix its problems?</head>
    <body>“I see I have some new followers,” said Linda Yaccarino, adding side-eyes and waving hand emojis to a tongue-in-cheek post responding to the social media explosion that followed her unveiling as Twitter’s new chief executive on Friday. Still weeks away from taking up the role, Yaccarino, a respected media veteran known in advertising circles as the “Velvet Hammer” for her silky but tough negotiating style, has already had a taste of the shambolic corporate environment that has swept the platform since billionaire Elon Musk bought it for $44bn last October. Hours after teasing in a post that he had appointed a new chief executive, a role he had described as a “painful” job that anyone would be “foolish” to take on, Musk confirmed speculation that Yaccarino had accepted the challenge. Related: From dealing with Musk to fixing Twitter Blue: what’s in the next CEO’s in-tray? The 60-year-old New Yorker leaves a role running the $13bn annual ad sales business at the Sky owner Comcast’s broadcasting division, NBCUniversal. Prior to Musk’s announcement, she had been rehearsing to lead the company’s annual pitch to advertisers on Monday in the biggest event of the year for the business. Instead, Yaccarino will need to channel her considerable skills to convince many of those same advertisers to return to Twitter, which has seen ad sales halve from about $5bn to $2.5bn as brands have balked at Musk’s moves to drastically relax content moderation policies. “She is ideal for the job,” said Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder of marketing services giant WPP and digital ad business S4 Capital, who most recently spent time with Yaccarino at the Cannes Lions advertising event in the south of France last year. “I don’t think Musk could have found anyone better for understanding advertisers, both in analogue and digital.” Elon Musk talks to Yaccarino at the ‘Possible’ marketing conference last month. Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/AP Yaccarino has softly taken Musk to task over his cavalier decision-making and penchant for using social media to make announcements that have landed him in hot water with regulators, telling him at a recent event to perhaps refrain from making posts after 3am. However, when she suggested he be held to a “different or higher standard” of conduct, due to his ownership of Twitter and popularity on the site, the world’s second richest man shot back that would be a “diminishment of freedom of speech”. The appointment of Yaccarino, whose Instagram account features shots with stars including Vin Diesel, Rami Malek and Kim Kardashian, has prompted a scouring of her own background as observers seek to glean her potential decision-making strategy. Her role as chair of the taskforce on the future of work at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a target for conspiracy theorists and an event criticised by Musk, led to comments from some quarters suggesting she might undermine Twitter’s absolutist free speech policy. Musk responded with tweets telling critics to give Yaccarino a chance, while also indicating that he would not ditch his free speech policy in search of commercial returns. Some of Twitter’s right-leaning base also voiced concerns about her support for Covid-19 vaccinations and mask-wearing, including working on an educational ad campaign featuring Pope Francis for the Joe Biden administration in 2021, in her role as chair of the non-profit advertising group the Ad Council. Know the facts! The @AdCouncil is working to inform Americans on why we must embrace an FDA-approved #Covid vaccine and how to go about it. We&apos;re almost there, let’s cross the finish line. @lisaesherman https://t.co/AUv9tf9IFb — Linda Yaccarino (@lindayacc) November 24, 2020 Liberal Twitter users have moved to point out that she has “liked” tweets from figures including Ron DeSantis, the conservative Republican governor with one eye on a potential run for president, and the rightwing commentator Jesse Watters. And in 2018, she was appointed to Donald Trump’s president’s council on sports fitness and nutrition. From a commercial perspective, Yaccarino is viewed as having the experience, close ad-industry relationships and professionalism that Musk needs to put Twitter back on track. Dan Ives, an analyst at US investment firm Wedbush, has described Musk’s move as a “home run hire” for Twitter. Yaccarino, who grew up in an Italian-American Catholic family and resides in an affluent village on Long Island, New York, with her husband and two children, is a liberal arts and telecommunications student who graduated from Penn State University. Her media career began as an intern at NBC Universal, which owns assets including Universal Studios, TV network NBC and the streaming service Peacock. She then joined Turner Broadcasting, which is now part of Warner Bros Discovery, and spent two decades rising through the ranks. Linda Yaccarino at the NBCUniversal Upfront in New York in May 2019. Photograph: NBC U Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty Images In 2011, she returned to NBCUniversal and was said to have been considering a chief executive role, but was not selected to replace the boss, Jeff Shell, when he left the company after admitting an inappropriate relationship with an employee. While Yaccarino has now got her wish, the biggest question is whether the mercurial Musk will cede enough control to allow her to revitalise its ailing advertising business. The Tesla CEO, who has cut almost 90% of Twitter’s staff and overseen unpopular product rollouts and technical issues, has said he will leave “business operations” to Yaccarino – but will remain executive chairman, chief technology officer and head of product. “She doesn’t see it as mission impossible, she sees it as a fixable situation,” Sorrell says. “The big question is, will Musk give her enough room to operate and deal with the brand safety issue?’ That is the primary concern for clients who want to be able to advertise in a less controversial environment.”</body>

    <head>UK white supremacist jailed over racist podcasts</head>
    <body>The white supremacist host of a podcast that made “vile” racist attacks in an attempt to stir up hatred, divide communities and spread fear has been jailed for two and a half years. James Allchurch, 51, from Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, and his guests used extreme racial slurs and propagated racist ideology while discussing topics such as grooming gangs, immigration, slavery and crime. Those invited on to the podcast included Alex Davies, a co-founder of the far-right group National Action, who was jailed last year for being a member of a banned organisation. Allchurch, a self-proclaimed white supremacist and Adolf Hitler supporter, was found guilty by a jury sitting in Swansea of 10 counts of distributing audio material to stir up racial hatred over a two-year period. In mitigation, Allchurch’s barrister, Emily Baxter, said that after he was injured at work in 2007, he became unemployed and isolated, spending a lot of time online talking to people with far-right views, many of them in the US. But the judge, Huw Rees, told Allchurch he was a “perfectly intelligent man” whose lack of work “gave you the time you needed to harbour and promote your warped thinking and express it in highly emotive, racial and antisemitic language”. The judge continued: “You were bent on inciting racial hatred. Your offending amounts to a stain on our humanity for our fellow human beings. The contents of these podcasts were vile. You are a man who holds deep-seated views of a highly pejorative racist and antisemitic nature.” The judge highlighted a probation report that said while there was “no direct victim”, what Allchurch had done “has an impact on community cohesion” and created fear. Each charge he faced related to a separate episode uploaded by Allchurch between May 2019 and March 2021 to a public website called Radio Aryan, later renamed Radio Albion. A number of other known extremists from the UK and US featured on the podcast talking to Allchurch, who went by the alias Sven Longshanks – a reference to King Edward I, who was also known as Edward Longshanks and was responsible for expelling Jewish people from England in 1290. Jonathan Rees KC, prosecuting, described the podcasts as “highly racist, antisemitic and white supremacist in nature”. Rees said: “The very purpose of Radio Aryan was to spread his propaganda about racial conflict.” The prosecutor said that about 4,000 people listened to the podcasts when they were first posted, and they remained in an archive that could be accessed later. He said Allchurch used the podcast as a “propaganda mouthpiece” and said it was aimed at “impressionable” listeners.</body>

    <head>Bin crews to work four-day week as UK trials extend to public sector frontline</head>
    <body>Bin crews could soon be putting their feet up on a Monday as the wave of four-day-week trials spreading across the UK finally reaches frontline public services. South Cambridgeshire district council has agreed to test a 32-hour working week for 150 refuse loaders and drivers this summer after successful experiments with reduced working hours with office- and laptop-based staff. Workers who investigate fly-tipping, undertake dredging and are council caretakers will also try the new working pattern. Related: ‘An undeniable success’: first UK council trial of four-day week set to be extended Pay will remain the same and the council has assured householders that they will receive the same service, if not better. It is hoped that the city council, with whom the district shares waste services, will agree to the plan in the coming months. It could cost £339,000 extra over two years, according to council papers, as an increase in staff and new lorries are required. Savings are expected to be made by a reduction in the use of agency staff as working on bin crews becomes a more appealing prospect. Joe Ryle, the director of the 4 Day Week Campaign, which has helped steer trials in the private sector, said: “We have always said the four-day week must apply for everyone, so it is brilliant the first ever trial for blue-collar workers in the public sector has been approved. It’s only fair that public-sector workers and those in non-office jobs benefit too.” The decision follows the world’s largest trial of a four-day week in the UK, which resulted in 56 of the 61 companies taking part carrying on with the test, and 18 making the arrangement permanent. Companies involved ranged from the Charity Bank in Kent to Rivelin Robotics in Sheffield. Among the firms that struggled were Allcap, an industrial supplies company, which tried a nine-day fortnight and found that after “nine extreme ones – once [employees] got to their scheduled day off, they were exhausted”. Nevertheless, polling last week showed that 58% of the British public expected a four-day week to be the normal way of working by 2030, with only 22% believing it would not. Bridget Smith, the leader of South Cambridgeshire district council, said that as part of preparations to make the trial a success, bin routes had been rationalised to reduce wasted time and “everybody will be working more intensely and productively”. Bin crews have typically worked 37-hour weeks – but the job is known as “task and finish”, which means it can be done more quickly or slowly. Henry Batchelor, the council lead for environmental services, said: “Nationally and locally, it is often difficult to recruit staff, especially at the waste service. To help deal with this, and further support the wellbeing of our hardworking crews, we need to try something new. For us, that is a proposed four-day week trial, which we have been testing successfully among our desk-based colleagues since the start of the year.” Before the wider trial started, the council was spending about £2m a year on agency staff. It estimates that this bill could be halved if all these posts were filled permanently. The trial has so far cut the annual wage bill by £300,000. The GMB trade union, which represents refuse workers and has been in discussions with the council, said: “The union is cautiously positive but we are constant dialogue with our members to ensure there are no unforeseen equality issues or detriments to terms and conditions.”</body>

    <head>Turkey election: what can we expect from Erdoğan v Kılıçdaroğlu runoff?</head>
    <body>Turkey’s election is widely considered to be the most important in the world this year – as a fight for the future of Turkish democracy, a referendum on a strongman populist leader, and a possible shift in Turkey’s influential role on the world stage. After a long and tense vote count, neither Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – the dominant figure in Turkish politics for 20 years – nor his main rival, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, reached the 50% threshold for outright victory. They will go to a runoff in two weeks’ time. What happened in the vote? Parliamentary and presidential elections took place in Turkey on Sunday. In the 600-seat parliament, Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) and its allies secured by far the most seats, 321, while the opposition won 213 and the 66 remaining seats went to a pro-Kurdish alliance. In the presidential vote, Turkey’s Supreme Election Council had Erdoğan at 49.51% and Kılıçdaroğlu at 44.88%. A third candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan Oğan, took a vital 5.17% that appears to have kept both Kılıçdaroğlu or Erdoğan from getting over the 50% line. Election day was characterised by controversy over different figures being released by two leading news agencies, and efforts by both sides to frame them to their own advantage. Why is the election so important? The elections are crucial to the future of Turkey’s battered economy –, but also as a marker of the state of democracy in an era of authoritarian leaders in fragile democracies around the world. The vote had been presented as a last chance to stop Erdoğan from turning the country into a full-blown autocracy. Why was it close? While Erdoğan’s grip on the levers of power has brought Turkey close to autocracy, he has made serious economic missteps recently. He has increased his control of the theoretically independent central bank and steadfastly refused to increase interest rates despite inflation that officially touched 80% last year and which independent analysts say could, in reality, have surpassed 100%. Turkish people are far poorer and more uncertain of their futures as a result. The government response to the devastating recent earthquake was widely viewed as inadequate. In February, Erdoğan made the tone-deaf comment that “whatever happens, happens, this is part of fate’s plan”. However, he has outperformed expectations and appears to be further ahead than was previously predicted. Who is Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu? Kılıçdaroğlu, a dour former accountant and bureaucrat and the longtime head of the Republican People’s party (CHP), was not a universally popular choice among the opposition to stand. Related: Could a diverse alliance end Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s authoritarian rule? A social democrat, Kılıçdaroğlu is at the head of a coalition that includes nationalists who are only supporting him because of their desperation to unseat Erdoğan. He has promised to stand down after a single term after instituting more conventional economic policies and restoring full parliamentary democracy. Was the election fair? The speed of the count, and how that information has been put out to the public, has been contested. The opposition claims ballot boxes were withheld in areas where it had majorities, and that the count has been weighted to give figures for areas that support Erdoğan and the AKP first, and then slow-walking and contesting the opposition’s count. While Turkey is not an autocracy, Erdoğan is said to have influence over the election authorities. He has liberally disbursed incentives to voters to back him again, increasing government workers’ pay by 45% five days before the election, reducing electricity prices and giving people a free month of natural gas supplies. Meanwhile, the Turkish media, largely controlled by his allies, has given him much more airtime than Kılıçdaroğlu: one study found that in April he got 32 hours on state radio and TV against 32 minutes for his rival. How will the runoff go? Related: ‘We’re against LGBT’: Erdoğan targets gay and trans people ahead of critical Turkish election Erdoğan clearly has the advantage. But the question of which side is able to successfully spin a story about its own success – and thereby either create a sense of momentum for the opposition or stymie it – will be central. The fight over the interpretation of the vote is really a symbol of how divided the country is. It is a question of whether Kılıçdaroğlu can plausibly say: “Just a little further, we can do this.” One question is where the votes for the ultranationalist third-place candidate, Oğan, will go. Voting for him was seen as a protest vote. It is possible his voters will be accepting of Kılıçdaroğlu because there are nationalists in his coalition. Oğan is being interviewed on the hour by different channels to say what he wants from the runoff. He is already the kingmaker. That leaves Kılıçdaroğlu in a bind as his campaign has been leaning increasingly left to get support from the Kurds – infuriating the nationalists. He has defended the rights of the marginalised Kurdish minority, even as Erdoğan has sought to tie him to an insurgency waged by Kurdish militants. Now Kılıçdaroğlu needs to lean right, and in practice that could mean disavowing the Kurds – even though they have feted and welcomed him.</body>

    <head>UK government wins right to take back control of military homes worth £8bn</head>
    <body>The UK government has won the right to take back control of thousands of military homes worth £8bn after a court ruled that the previous privatisation was a “bad deal” for the government, in a significant blow to the private equity investor Guy Hands. London’s high court ruled on Monday that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has the right to buy back the remaining 38,000 homes, which were bought in 1996 by Annington, a group of companies ultimately controlled by Hands, for £1.7bn. Annington immediately said it planned to appeal against the decision. MPs on parliament’s public accounts committee described the sell-off as “disastrous for taxpayers” because it did not include clauses to give them a share of future price rises for the properties. The government missed out on as much as £4.2bn as the value of the 57,400 homes rose, the MPs said in 2018. However, the MoD remained a leaseholder, paying rents to Annington. Government lawyers advised that ministers had the right to enfranchisement, the ability to buy the freehold of leased properties. Annington had argued that the government should not have that right, and that the state was exercising its powers improperly. Mr Justice Holgate found that there was no way to say the government’s “motive was improper” in wanting to take back the properties, as the defence secretary was “entitled to make legitimate use of such bargaining power as he has”. He wrote: “The arrangements were and still remain a bad deal for the MoD, its [service family accommodation] estate and the public purse.” An Annington spokesperson said: “We are surprised and disappointed by the outcome. It risks setting a dangerous precedent for businesses and international investors in the UK and if upheld would mean that the government can disregard long-term contracts if it believes it is in its interests to do so. As we consider this to be a matter of significant public importance, we will appeal this decision.” If the appeal were unsuccessful, the victory in the test case would allow the government to take back control of the whole estate. If the enfranchisement proceeds, the government will pay a price for the homes decided by a court. An MoD spokesperson said: “We welcome the decision of the high court, which finds that the MoD acted lawfully in seeking, successfully, to establish its right to enfranchisement. “No decision has been taken on further enfranchisement cases, but we will consider the high court’s decision and the potential implications for securing better value for money for the taxpayer.” The judgment showed that government officials had in 2021 advised ministers to move quickly to take back the properties to because “a scenario in which MoD waited for Guy Hands to crystallise a very significant profit, walk away, and then MoD decided to exercise its rights against the new owner … would be reputationally very damaging for MoD”. Natasha Rees, a senior partner at Forsters, a law firm that represented the government, said: “The high court has found that MoD does benefit from a right to enfranchise. MoD will now consider whether enfranchisement might achieve better value for money for the taxpayer. The case involved complex aspects of the law of enfranchisement, some of which had never been decided before.”</body>

    <head>Greenwashing era is over, say ad agencies, as regulators get tough</head>
    <body>Across the advertising industry, agencies are wrestling with their role in greenwashing scandals and their support for clients driving the climate and nature crises. Companies are to face stricter rules from regulators in London and Brussels over what they can tell consumers about their role in the climate crisis and the loss of nature. Terms such as “carbon neutral”, “nature positive” and those concerned with offsetting are to undergo greater scrutiny by organisations such as the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK. In order to take meaningful action, agencies must also reconsider their relationships with major polluters, industry insiders have said. “The era of unspecific claims such as ‘environmentally friendly’ is over,” said Jonny White, senior business director at AMV BBDO, which works with companies including Diageo, Unilever and Bupa. “Misleading environmental claims are under the microscope from advertising regulators, consumer watchdogs and even governments. The risks of getting it wrong are huge, with brands being shamed publicly when they are guilty of misleading the public,” he said. Related: UK advertising watchdog to crack down on carbon offsetting claims Creative members of advertising agencies are having to work closely with their legal teams when advising clients on their climate claims, insiders have said, with an increased risk of fines and advert bans in some countries. In the UK, the Ad Net Zero programme was launched in 2020 in a bid to reduce the carbon impact of the advertising industry’s operations to net zero by 2030, but many agencies are developing in-house teams for sustainability-focused campaigns. “In many client organisations, there is still a big gap between the marketing and sustainability teams. They have different, often competing objectives, and are accountable in very different ways,” said Ben Essen, global chief strategy officer at the global marketing agency Iris Worldwide, which works with firms such as Adidas, Starbucks and Samsung, and is also doing the campaign for Cop26. Essen said there is an “inherent tension” between the need to engage audiences through “often hyperbolic stories” and the need for sustainability teams to deal in the substance. On Thursday, the European parliament voted to ban claims of carbon neutrality that are based on offsetting. The EU environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said firms would face greater scrutiny about their claims with offsets, but stopped short of supporting a ban, given their potential to fund climate crisis mitigation. “Climate-related claims have been shown to be particularly prone to being unclear and ambiguous, misleading the consumer. Claims like ‘climate neutral’, ‘carbon neutral’, ‘100% CO2 compensated’ and ‘net zero’ are very often based on offsetting. We need to set things straight for consumers and give them full information,” he said. Blake Harrop, president of Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam, which works with Airbnb, Meta and Nike, said that the greenwashing clampdown in the EU and UK would provide competitive opportunities for companies that had genuine environmental credentials. “For good brands with good intentions and responsible messaging, I expect there will be little change. But for companies that have oversimplified and overstated their sustainability claims, then life is about to get complicated,” he said. “It’s an interesting time to work in the legal department of an advertising agency. We need to pay a lot of attention to the opportunities and risks generated by AI, government policies regarding media platforms like TikTok around the world, and of course greenwashing laws. “If all brands can claim they’re green, then you remove the incentive to win consumers based on superior commitments to the environment. This will hopefully make being an environmentally responsible brand even better for business,” he said. Within the advertising industry there is ongoing friction regarding agencies continuing to work with fossil fuel companies. Clean Creatives, an organisation based in the US, publishes an annual “F-list” of agencies that work with some of the world’s biggest polluters. It also runs the Clean Creatives pledge, for agencies that want to swear off working with fossil fuel clients in the future. To date, more than 500 agencies have signed up. However, Ad Net Zero has previously declared it does not stand behind that campaign, with its chair, Seb Munden, saying: “We cannot leave huge swathes of the industry behind.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features</body>

    <head>Police chief leading racism plan retires after bullying claims made against him</head>
    <body>A police chief in one of Britain’s biggest forces has retired after allegations of bullying and discrimination were made against him. Tyron Joyce stepped down while deputy chief constable leading police chiefs’ national effort to fix the race crisis plaguing law enforcement. He was on secondment from the West Yorkshire force. Only limited detail about his departure from policing is being released. Last month the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, received complaints about him. They assessed them and decided Joyce’s home force – West Yorkshire – should investigate, rather than the watchdog investigate independently. West Yorkshire police are refusing to say whether they will or have started the investigation. The IOPC said: “We received a mandatory conduct referral from West Yorkshire police in April relating to allegations of bullying and discrimination by a senior officer. “After careful consideration of the available information, we determined the matter should be subject to a local investigation. “We have also advised the force that any additional conduct matters identified during the investigation should be referred to the IOPC for further consideration.” West Yorkshire police refused to comment, citing their belief that they can not comment about a named individual. They also refused to comment on whether they were investigating a former senior officer of theirs. The allegations against Joyce were received by the IOPC on 19 April this year. The IOPC sent them back to West Yorkshire to investigate on 27 April. Joyce was programme director for the National Police Chiefs’ Council race action plan. The council says it was told of his plans to retire on 2 May. Joyce at the time of his departure from policing was one of the most senior black officers in the country. The NPCC’s race action plan was launched in 2020 after the murder in the United States of George Floyd by a police officer, which led to protest across the world, including in the United Kingdom. Three years on, the race action plan is beset by problems and the NPCC insists the programme will continue despite Joyce’s departure. The NPCC said: “We were notified of DCC Tyron Joyce’s decision to retire and therefore step away from his role as programme director “The senior responsible officer for the work strand remains chief constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the NPCC and the programme of work will continue as normal.” Joyce, while a chief superintendent with the West Yorkshire force, oversaw the National Police Air Service. He was promoted after claims were made about his conduct. News of his departure from policing was first reported by the Daily Telegraph, which said Joyce had clashes with colleagues, which had led to the formal complaints.</body>

    <head>‘Is this really going to work?’: the makers of mega-hit video game The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</head>
    <body>The release of a new Zelda game is always a major event worldwide. Ever since 1986, when famed Japanese game designer Shigeru Miyamoto first attempted to capture in code some of the wonder he experienced exploring the Kyoto countryside as a child, Zelda games have been pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in virtual worlds. Look at any best-games-of-all-time list and you’ll see Zelda in the Top 10, often more than once. But 2017’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was particularly special. Launching alongside the Nintendo Switch console, which has since sold more than 125m units, it was perhaps the best realisation yet of the promise of boundless freedom and adventure that video games have been dangling in front of players’ noses for decades. It got rave reviews and sales hit 30m, many millions of those buyers new to the fantasy world of Hyrule. Pretty much everyone loved it. Soon, indie-pop star St Vincent was confessing to putting 300 hours into it. Gaaahh, how do I do this? What? I can’t – oh wait, I did it! So what do you do after you’ve just released one of the best video games ever? For director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and the rest of Breath’s team, the answer was simple: try to make something even better. Remarkably, they now appear to have managed it. The sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, was released on Friday and had critics (including me) displaying an unbecoming lack of restraint. Set in the same world as Breath, it expands the game upwards to gorgeous sky islands, and downwards through gaping chasms to Hyrule’s dark and dangerous underworld, letting players move freely between them. The ultimate aim, as it always has been, is to track down Princess Zelda and save the realm from an encroaching evil, but how you get there is up to you. Tears of the Kingdom asks that you approach its puzzles and environments even more creatively, smooshing together self-made weapons and contraptions from parts left lying around. It is a technological and creative marvel. Creative fireworks … Eiji Aonuma, left, and Hidemaro Fujibayashi. Photograph: - Fujibayashi tells me that the idea for Tears coalesced, appropriately, through experimental play – the same kind of messing around that Breath’s players have been doing in thousands of hours of YouTube videos over the past six years. Almost immediately after Breath’s release, the team started tinkering, to see if they could get more out of the world they had created. “There were various objects you could ride around on or move around, such as gears that turned on their own,” he explains. “We tried attaching those to a board – and realised you could make a car. Another thing you could do was use four boards to create a tube, then use a remote-control bomb to turn it into a cannon and make objects fly. Boards stuck to gears could create paddles to power a boat. We thought there was a lot of potential just using what was already there.” After a few months of figuring out exactly what he wanted to make, Fujibayashi put together a video showing off the team’s ambitions, to present to his bosses at Nintendo. Among them were Miyamoto, now 70 and still a strong presence at the company, along with producer Eiji Aonuma, from whom Fujibayashi took the reins of Zelda in 2011. Aonuma is the most recognisable face of Zelda, director of some of the series’ greatest hits, from 1998’s stunningly innovative and atmospheric Ocarina of Time, to 2003’s cartoonish sailing adventure Wind Waker. He also directed my personal favourite: 2000’s Majora’s Mask, an eerie tale of impending disaster and lost innocence. Aonuma is an amiable presence, with a laugh full of the playful glee his games often inspire. He has worked on Zelda since the mid-90s – nobody understands the series better. Yet, he admits, at first he wasn’t entirely sold on Fujibayashi’s ideas. “It was my suggestion to make the next game a sequel,” says Aonuma. “I thought there was still a lot we could do with this world. But I can’t see so much into the future, so initially I was like, ‘Is this really going to work?’” Fujibayashi’s blueprints got the green light regardless and, as work progressed, Aonuma was slowly won over. In Nintendo’s Kyoto HQ, the two work on either side of a partition, and Aonuma is given to involuntary yelps when he’s enjoying a game. “Depending on how much I voice my excitement, I can gauge whether something’s really fun,” he says with a laugh. Fujibayashi smiles and remembers his colleague test-driving his new creations: “I’d hear him going, ‘Gaaahh, how do I do this? What? I can’t – oh wait, I did it!’ When those shouts kept coming, I knew this was going to be a good game.” Turning point … Breath of the Wild. Photograph: Nintendo It shouldn’t be a surprise that Tears tries something radical. In three decades, Zelda has never shied away from reinventing itself. Like all the best legends, it is reshaped with each fresh incarnation. But some elements endure. Across 20 or so games, there’s always an elven hero named Link fighting a great evil. He, Princess Zelda and demon-king Ganondorf appear again and again, in different forms and timelines, in different versions of a kingdom named Hyrule that might be flooded, fractured, war-torn or long abandoned. The Link of Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask is a rather tragic figure: a kid sent forward in time to save the world, and robbed of his own childhood in the process. In Wind Waker, he is a boisterous youngster, rendered in bold cartoon lines. In Twilight Princess, he is a teen hero for the emo age, silent and sullen. The stories of all the Zelda games fit together in a branching timeline, but each can also stand alone as a version of the myth. Breath was a turning point, simply because of its peerless sense of freedom. Before, Zelda games were made up of overworlds and dungeons: you’d explore them in sequence, each dungeon bestowing a new tool that opened up more of the map. The puzzles were locks with specific keys: throw boomerangs at switches, use bombs to blow up cracked walls, pull yourself across chasms with a hookshot. In both Breath and Tears, though, you can go anywhere, following your own sense of adventure. You’ll never find yourself unable to explore further because you don’t have the right gadget: instead, the limitation is your own imagination, or your own ingenuity. A Link Between Worlds, the Nintendo 3Ds game from 2013, felt like a bridge between the structure of classic Zelda and the total openness of modern Zelda; playing it now, you can see Aonuma and the team straining against old conventions. But, he says, it was the technological advance of the Nintendo Switch console that finally freed them: “In the past, there always had to be an entrance and an exit.” This was down to older consoles’ memory limits. “That’s why we needed dungeons. But now these things can all be connected. The freedom has been made possible by the evolution of the hardware. Having a seamless experience greatly improves the game design as well.” A world as rich as a fantasy novel … A Link to the Past. Photograph: Nintendo For all that Zelda has changed, and for all that Tears brings to the table, some things stay the same. As a child, when I first played Zelda: A Link to the Past, it was the only game world I’d ever encountered that felt as rich and full of promise as the fantasy novels I loved – and the games still retain that depth and mystery. They feel like you could live inside them. And they’re still games about curiosity, tapping into the human impulse to explore. Every time you solve one of its puzzles, you get a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. “A lot of the time,” says Aonuma, “people tell me Zelda gives them these wonderful ‘I did it!’ moments – when they solve a puzzle and think they must be the only person in the world who could have cracked it. If we provided too much guidance about how to do things, they wouldn’t feel that way. The satisfaction comes from exploring and figuring things out – that’s the route to joy. In Tears of the Kingdom, I believe this feeling has become even stronger.” “Zelda,” adds Fujibayashi, “allows us to make games based on plenty of ideas. I can always realise whatever it is that I want to achieve. I approach each new idea, each new game, with excitement. Even though I’ve been working on the Zelda series for a long time, I’ve never gotten bored.” The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is out now on Nintendo Switch; £59.99</body>

    <head>Ben Stokes a fitness doubt for England’s first Test of summer against Ireland</head>
    <body>Ben Stokes is the latest player whose fitness for England’s opening Test of the summer has been thrown into doubt, with the coach of his Indian Premier League team admitting that the Test captain is unable to bowl and is being seen simply as “batting cover”, six weeks after his last appearance in the competition. Despite being signed for around £1.6m in December’s player auction Stokes has so far played only the first two of Chennai Super Kings’ 13 games, scoring seven and eight and conceding 18 runs in his solitary over. Stephen Fleming has said Stokes, who has a left knee injury, is unlikely to appear in their last two matches as the team seeks to seal a place in the playoffs. “Ben’s ability to bowl overs at the moment is still a bit of a challenge but he’s there as batting cover,” the New Zealander said, adding of his potential selection in the remainder of the season that “it’s not our style to chop and change”. Related: Cricket Australia should consider avoiding 26 January, says Usman Khawaja That has also been England’s hallmark in their first year under the stewardship of Stokes and Fleming’s compatriot Brendon McCullum. But for all their consistency of selection there is a lot of uncertainty about the makeup of the side that will play Ireland at Lord’s in a fortnight, and of the squad for that game which will be announced on Tuesday. One name whose presence is guaranteed is Jonny Bairstow, who has returned to full fitness following last September’s freak golfing injury and is ready to test McCullum’s public promise that “as soon as he’s fit he’s back in the side”. Bairstow has kept wicket in the two games he has played this month for Yorkshire and with Harry Brook having flourished over the winter at No 5, where the 33-year-old played to such effect last summer, he seems likely to be given the gloves and a place at No 7, thereby nudging Ben Foakes out of the side and perhaps the squad. Foakes was repeatedly described as “the best wicketkeeper in the world” by Stokes last year but his restrained batting style – “I’m not, as you’d say, Bazball,” as he put it in February – sits uneasily with England’s overall approach since McCullum’s appointment. This decision may need to be postponed should Stokes decide to spend the Ireland Test on the sidelines. Jimmy Anderson’s groin injury, confirmed late on Sunday night after a scan on Saturday, has turned another certain starter into a mere possible – and with the Ashes in mind no risks are likely to be taken against Ireland. Meanwhile, the three bowlers of express pace that England had planned to rotate through the summer might all start it on the sidelines, with Jofra Archer still discomfited by an elbow injury, Olly Stone already out with a hamstring strain and Mark Wood at home awaiting the birth of his first child. This could lead to the return of Chris Woakes, who has not played a Test since last March, the dying days of Joe Root’s captaincy, having been ruled out of the entire 2022 summer with a persistent knee injury. Saqib Mahmood and Matthew Fisher, two other players with Test experience, will also be considered by a committee that for the first time includes Luke Wright after his appointment as selector last November. Woakes’s appeal is boosted by a remarkable record at Lord’s, where in five matches he has taken 27 wickets at an average of 11.33 (of those who have played there at least four times the only other Englishman whose bowling average is below 14.5 is WG Grace, with 13.0). England selectors will also remember that when Ireland played a Test there in 2019 Woakes took six second-innings wickets for 17 runs in 7.4 overs to propel England to victory. If selected he would join Anderson, Stuart Broad, Ollie Robinson and Matt Potts as seam options, alongside the spinner Jack Leach. Meanwhile, the ICC’s cricket committee has bowed to pressure – including from Stokes and Broad, as well as India’s former captain, Virat Kohli – to stop requiring on-field officials to give a soft signal when they refer decisions, such as low catches, to the TV umpire. “Soft signals have been discussed at previous cricket committee meetings over the last couple of years,” said the chair, Sourav Ganguly. “The committee deliberated this at length and concluded that soft signals were unnecessary and at times confusing.”</body>

    <head>What’s fashionable and goes ping? The microwave gets Vogue’s seal of approval</head>
    <body>Name: The microwave. Age: 78. It was invented in 1945 after the US radar engineer Percy Spencer realised the device he was standing next to was melting his chocolate bar. Appearance: Boxy. Why are we talking about microwaves? Has someone nuked herring in the office again? Are you still harping on about that? No, the microwave is having a moment, according to Vogue. If Vogue says so, it must be true. But why? Is there a Prada x Panasonic collab in the works? Or has Sam Smith turned one into trousers? Not yet. But one Vogue writer has been testing microwave cookery. Why on earth have they been doing that? It doesn’t sound very chic. Microwaves are apparently enjoying a chef-led rehabilitation, spearheaded by the chef and restaurateur David Chang, whose book of microwave-led home cooking features fragrant mussels, umami-rich chawanmushi and even spaghetti cacio e pepe. Yikes, I bet Italy is thrilled. I believe they’ve considered withdrawing their ambassador to the US, although Chang prepares only the sauce, not the pasta, in the microwave, so perhaps a diplomatic incident can be avoided. No shade to Vogue, but hasn’t the microwavé been having a moment since Nigella archly mispronounced it? Lawson told us she reheated milk in the mee-cro-war-vay in 2020, a cultural event of immense significance, yes. But way back in 2012, Jamie Oliver was calling it “brilliant technology” and waxing lyrical about its way with potatoes and puddings. What’s supercharged the microwavé’s rehabilitation is the cost of living crisis. Tell me more. Microwaving is one of the cheapest, most energy-efficient ways to cook, with some estimates putting the cost of using one at as little as 8p a day. I suppose that’s worth a little brain frying. Don’t worry: the rays can’t escape from the metal box, so you would have to climb inside and cook yourself to do serious harm. The World Health Organization isn’t worried. Next you’ll be telling me they don’t cook food from the inside out. “The waves lose energy as they pass through food, so anything more than 2cm or so from the surface won’t heat up much,” according to New Scientist. My mind is blown (but not microwaved). You haven’t mentioned the microwave’s greatest contribution to civilisation. What? Reheating a forgotten cup of coffee 12 times in one day. Oh, was that yours? Sorry, I chucked it when I was heating my sardine and stilton soup. Do say: “Ping!” Don’t say: “I’ll tell you what’s hot for autumn/winter 2023: potatoes.”</body>

    <body>Things I have learned reading about eggs: that chickens have earlobes, and the colour of the earlobes correlates with the colour of the egg: white ear lobe, white egg; red ear lobe, brown egg. What can lay an egg? An orange-peel doris can lay an egg in a tidal pool; a bee hummingbird can lay an egg the size of an aspirin; an auk on a cliff lays a conical egg, which will roll around in a circle instead of forwards and off the edge; a spider wraps her egg in silk, places it on a stalk, then lays another. Related: A sea snake: like a nightmare generated by a sleep app | Helen Sullivan To Linda Pastan, an egg was “a moon / glowing faintly / in the galaxy of the barn”. Approach it, and Louise Glück will tell you: “The thing is hatching. Look.” One egg looks – apart from its size, the sharpness of its point, or its colour – much like another: they are all pleasing in the same way, hard-shelled and soft-shaped. “An egg is the most beautiful of all / beautiful forms, a box without corners / in which anything can be contained,” wrote Elizabeth Spires. This one structure, variations on round, can hold things shaped as differently as: a snake, an auk, a platypus; an emu, a tortoise, a peacock. An egg, unfertilised, is one giant cell. The bee hummingbird’s tiny egg is a single cell. An ostrich’s enormous egg is a single cell. In South Africa, my father scrambled an ostrich egg for breakfast: it was enough for 15 people. The ovum is the largest cell in the human body, and the only one that can be seen with the naked eye. At 20 weeks old, the foetus that became my daughter held within her body every egg she would have for the rest of her life. So, for many days, many years ago, my mother held in her body the egg that would become my daughter. And for 30 years I carried the egg cell that became my daughter with me wherever I went, even as almost every other cell in my body replaced itself multiple times. Related: An earthworm: when you are a child, these are an enormous part of your world | Helen Sullivan “I remembered something I’d read in the book I’d lifted from the charity shop in Brighton,” Ali Smith writes in Artful, “about birds’ eggs, how the egg of a bird is crystalline, made of layers lined with minuscule air canals so the chick inside can breathe; how the thickness of each egg’s shell meets exactly the pressure each incubating bird will bring to bear on it.” Should a fleck of shell fall into the egg when you crack it into the bowl, the thing that works best to remove it is another piece of shell. The fleck will resist your finger, or a spoon, or a knife, as though the egg is drawn to itself, and will leave only with part of itself, believing that it will form one thing again, with just the right pressure, and just the right shape: “the most beautiful of all beautiful forms”. • Helen Sullivan is a Guardian journalist.

    <head>Jenai quit her Melbourne flat because the mould was so bad – then it was relisted for $60 a week more</head>
    <body>After Jenai Ellen Tomlinson moved into her Melbourne flat last year, she discovered it had a serious mould problem. When the mould began spreading across the walls in June, she emailed her property manager. After the power cut out, her property manager sent an electrician, who found water in the main switch box. It took until October for the mould to be treated professionally, after multiple emails between the tenant, the agent, the body corporate and the mould treatment company. “My bathroom door was so rusted I couldn’t even close it,” Tomlinson says. “I lost all my personal belongings, all my furniture, everything. It was really bad.” Related: Rent in Australian capital cities climbs record 11.7% in 12 months But within months, the mould returned. Tomlinson messaged the agent in January and told them she was moving out. The apartment is now back on the market for $320 a week, $60 more than Tomlinson had been paying. Renters across Australia say they are moving out of unsafe or unsatisfactory properties, or being evicted, only to see the homes go back on the market for a higher rate once they leave. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup With rising rents, diminishing vacancies and limited legal protections, many find themselves left with few options. The agent for Tomlinson’s former home says the current market “justifies the very fair price it was re-advertised for”. They say any leaks that may have caused the mould have been fixed and the property was “professionally mould treated, cleaned and repainted with mould-resistant paint before any open inspections or new tenants had moved in”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Tomlinson has now moved back to Perth to live with family, saying she is “over” Melbourne’s heated rental market. Related: For housing to be affordable, prices must go down, not up. Here’s how it could happen | Matt Grudnoff ‘Technically, we’re still homeless’ She is far from the only tenant who has left a property in unhappy circumstances, only to discover it has been put back on the market at a higher rent. Last December, Claudine Keady was told she had to leave her four-bedroom property in Logan, Queensland, because the landlord wanted to move back in. A month after Keady and her three daughters, then aged 17, 19 and 22, were evicted, she saw it on realestate.com.au for $500 a week – $100 more than she had been paying. Keady’s rent had already gone up $20 in the past 12 months – Queensland law allows landlords to increase rent only once a year. After being evicted she lived in her car with her youngest daughter and two cats, and then in a shed, until her former husband said they could live with him in Sydney. “I want to save as much money as possible so that when I do find a rental, I can offer minimum three months – a lot of people are doing that,” she says. “Because, technically, we’re still homeless.” Tom, who did not want his real name used, found asbestos in the backyard of his home in the Sydney suburb of Strathfield – which he confirmed through tests – and mould in the bathroom. “I was then told [by the property manager] I should vacate the premises as the ‘landlord cared about my health’, only for them to up the rent $50 a week and take other tenants in once I’d moved out,” Tom says. Tom moved close by and decided to tell the new tenants about the asbestos. They told him they had signed only a six-month lease as the house was due to be demolished, but had not been told about any asbestos, he says. “I don’t understand how you can sleep at night having someone in a property knowing that there are all these problems with it,” he says. ‘A bad-faith approach to renting’ Advocates say the fundamental problem is that landlords can legally evict tenants without a reason. Leo Patterson Ross of the Tenants’ Union of NSW says he has heard from an increasing number of tenants who have been given a no-grounds eviction, only to find the apartment subsequently listed for more. “Sometimes the agents are banking on the rent bidding happening,” Patterson Ross says, referring to potential tenants offering more in rent in a bid to secure a place in the heated rental market. The NSW government has proposed legislation to end secret rent bidding, but advocates say disclosing higher offers could have the perverse effect of driving rents even higher. “They might think that the tenant might be able to cope with the increase but not keep up with a bidding process, or they might be assessing that the tenant’s income isn’t sufficient to pay that rent. Related: ‘Pouring fuel on the fire’: fear NSW’s move to ban secret rental bidding will drive prices up “It’s a bad-faith approach to renting. But it’s enabled because of no-grounds evictions.” Patterson Ross wants to see stronger protections for renters to stop agents evicting tenants for no reason. The practice is legal in most parts of Australia, with the ACT having the strongest protections for tenants after it removed all forms of tenancy termination without reason in 2022. In Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, no-fault evictions are banned except at the end of the first fixed term. In NSW the practice is legal, but there is cross-party support to outlaw it. “In [Queensland, Victoria and NSW], fair and reasonable eviction rules need to be implemented so that other parts of the system can work as the government intends,” Patterson Ross says. “The big problem with no-grounds evictions is that they undermine anything else that government has tried to implement in renting rules because renters are the main people who have to enforce tenancy law.”</body>

    <head>Guardian Essential poll: Labor maintains large lead over Coalition despite budget failing to impress voters</head>
    <body>The Albanese government has a commanding lead over the Coalition, 53% to 42% in two-party-preferred terms, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Taken after the release of Labor’s first full-year budget on 9 May, the poll also found that less than one quarter of respondents (24%) think the budget will be good for them personally, although that is up eight points since the same question was asked in November, after the October budget. The poll of 1,080 voters, released on Tuesday, finds a further 5% of voters are undecided. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, continued to record a strong approval rating, with a majority (54%) approving of his performance. Related: From jobseeker to vaping: which of Labor’s budget measures are likely to pass parliament? Guardian Essential’s two-party-preferred “plus” measure is a change in methodology adopted after the 2019 election to highlight the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. The poll found Labor leading the Coalition 60% to 38% among those aged 18 to 34, 56% to 39% among those 35 to 54 and trailing 45% to 48% among the over 55s. Asked which groups the budget would be good for, a bare majority (51%) said it would benefit “people receiving government payments”, followed by people on lower incomes (42%), the well-off (41%) and older Australians (37%). About one-third of voters thought the budget will help Australian families (35%) and women (33%). About one quarter said it would help younger Australians (26%) and average working people (25%). Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Coalition has attacked the budget for not doing enough to relieve inflationary pressures after the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, revealed a projected surplus of $4bn in 2022-23. But the poll found when asked about the surplus more voters think the “government should have used the money to provide direct support for people under cost of living pressure” (59%) than said it has “done the right thing in delivering a budget surplus that will ease pressure on inflation” (41%). The budget’s main items were a $5.7bn investment in Medicare, electricity bill relief of up to $500 for households, a $40-a-fortnight raise in jobseeker and 15% boost to the maximum rate of rent assistance. Despite saying those receiving government payments would do well out of the budget, just 19% of respondents said the budget would reduce poverty, although this figure increased to 31% among those aged 18 to 34. Related: Albanese expresses personal dislike for gambling ads during sporting events as pressure builds for ban Respondents were pessimistic about the budget’s effect in other areas, with only one-third (33%) saying it would create jobs, 29% saying it would reduce debt, 26% saying it will reduce cost-of-living pressures and 46% said it would “create long-term problems that will need to be fixed in the future”. The Essential poll found support for the Indigenous voice in the constitution was steady, easing back one point to 59% and those opposed rising one point to 41%. Support is stronger among women, who back the voice 62% to 38%, than men who back it 56% to 44%. Support is weakest among the over-55s who oppose the voice 60% to 40% and Coalition voters who oppose it 55% to 45%. The voice has majority support in most states, with more than 60% backing it in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia; although support is slimmer in Western Australia, where the yes side leads 52% to 48%. The only state opposed is Queensland, with 51% against the voice and 49% in favour. Related: Labor leaves door open for jobseeker recipients to work more hours before losing payments In the wake of King Charles the third’s coronation, the poll also found majority support for Australia to become a republic, with 54% saying if there were a referendum on becoming a republic they would vote yes, against 46% who said they would vote no. On the republic, the sample was split between those who were a hard yes (29%), hard no (27%), soft yes (25%) and soft no (20%). Albanese recorded majority approval, with 54% of respondents approving of the job he is doing as prime minister, up three points, and 35% disapproving, down two, and 11% say they don’t know how he is faring. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was steady at 36% who approve of the job he is doing, 45% who disapprove and 19% who don’t know.</body>

    <head>Rogue NSW taxi drivers still refusing to use meters despite crackdown, commissioner warns</head>
    <body>Rogue taxi drivers are still being caught refusing to use meters and demanding upfront and excessive payments from customers across Sydney, with calls for the New South Wales government to increase penalties for those fined for the illegal behaviour. A crackdown on taxi drivers attempting to negotiate fares with customers has so far resulted in compliance officers issuing 155 fines to cabbies, after the former Perrottet government passed laws to give the state’s point to point transport commission stronger powers in November. Plain-clothed officers are now able to issue the $300 fines. A 24-hour hotline has also received 1,469 fare-related calls during this period. Related: Taxi passengers across Australia say drivers increasingly demanding upfront cash instead of using meter The enforcement exercise proved successful in dampening the peak in offending behaviour at the end of last year – but while 96 drivers were pinged between late November and the end of December, just 59 fines have been issued this year. The NSW point to point commissioner, Anthony Wing, has warned a minority of taxi drivers are continuing to breach the law despite his crackdown. Wing said his commission’s “two fronts” approach to the issue, which combined compliance officers hailing cabs on the streets and following up on complaints received through the hotline, “worked very well together”. However only on-street compliance officers can issue fines. The majority of allegations raised with the commission – through its hotline – are considered resolved once a taxi company has been contacted about a complaint, investigated it, and reported back to the commission and the complainant. The commission does not fine the company, and a case can be marked resolved without a refund being issued. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Of the 1,469 fare-related calls made to the hotline, 1,106 were considered specifically regarding illegal behaviour including fare refusal, overcharging and failure to use a meter. Just 594 of these cases have been marked resolved. While complaints peaked late last year, Guardian Australia is aware of multiple reports of meter refusal and overcharging in recent weeks. Wing said while the spike in noncompliance had been blunted, his commission is still dealing with drivers breaching the law. Taxis hailed from a rank or on the street cannot refuse to use their meter, charge more than the meter amount or demand a fixed fare upfront. Wing said his commission’s officers have been out in force at taxi ranks and recent major events, such as sporting fixtures and concerts including those from Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran. The upcoming Fifa women’s world cup will be a focus in coming months. “A driver who wants to do the wrong thing will never know when one of their passengers will be one of my compliance officers. One of the reasons drivers are still doing this is because they think no passenger ever complains,” he said. “This is a subset of drivers doing the wrong thing. It’s a very popular crackdown with most taxi drivers because the actions of a few are tarnishing the brand of all drivers.” Natalie Ward, the opposition transport spokeswoman who served as the metropolitan roads minister in the Perrottet government, said the crackdown should be strengthened if needed. “If the penalties are not acting as a sufficient deterrent, the government should consider how to better enforce them, including increasing penalties as well as any need for additional deterrents to meet community expectations,” she said. “The vast majority of taxi drivers do the right thing. However, there are clearly some bad apples that need to be weeded out,” Ward said. NSW’s new transport minister, Jo Haylen, has not indicated she is considering tougher punishments for offending taxi drivers. “It is good to see that the point to point commission is cracking down on bad operators,” a spokesperson for Haylen said. “We’ll continue to support the point to point commission’s enforcement actions, and we’ll work with the commission to make sure passengers know their rights, particularly in the lead-up to major events.” Do you know more?

    <head>Adverts claiming products are carbon neutral by using offsetting face UK ban</head>
    <body>Adverts that claim products are carbon neutral using offsets are to be banned by the UK’s advertising watchdog unless companies can prove they really work, the Guardian can reveal, as Gucci becomes the latest company to struggle with a high-profile environmental commitment based on offsetting. Amid growing concern that firms are misleading consumers about the environmental impact of their products, the Advertising Standards Authority’s (ASA) is to begin stricter enforcement around the use of terms such as “carbon neutral”, “net zero” and “nature positive” as part of a greenwashing crackdown later this year after a six-month review. Under the plans, the ASA will take action against firms that tell consumers they can buy their products without making global heating or nature loss worse by virtue of purchasing offsets – unless they can demonstrate they really are effective. The move follows recent enforcement by the ASA against Lufthansa and Etihad about green claims. Companies will still be allowed to talk about their sustainability efforts, the Guardian understands. In January, a joint Guardian investigation found that many rainforest offsets certified by Verra, which operates the world’s leading carbon standard, had little impact despite being widely used by major companies for environmental claims, also finding evidence of forced evictions at a flagship project in Peru used by Disney and Apple. The findings were strongly disputed by Verra. While halting deforestation and protecting ecosystems is urgently required to limit global heating and biodiversity loss, analysis of scientific research into the rainforest projects found that most either stopped no forest loss or had dramatically overstated their impact approved by Verra’s system. Last month, a report by the carbon credit rating agency Calyx Global echoed the concerns about the environmental integrity of the credits, although other organisations have a more positive view. Scientists have called for the unregulated system to be urgently reformed to finance climate mitigation and forest conservation, and Verra is in the process of launching a new methodology for certifying rainforest carbon credits. Amid concerns about credibility, companies are increasingly being encouraged to say they are making climate contributions when purchasing carbon credits instead of claiming they have offset their emissions. The carbon market data firm AlliedOffsets monitors offset purchasing data for the $2bn (£1.6bn) market, recording several major purchases by leading companies. Gucci, Italy’s most valuable luxury brand, with revenues of €10.5bn in 2022, which announced it had become “entirely carbon neutral” in 2019 in part using Verra’s rainforest offsets, has deleted the claim from its website and said it was no longer working with South Pole, the Swiss carbon credit consultancy it partnered with on the commitment. “At Gucci, we are regularly reviewing our environmental claims in order to uphold the best science-based standards, as well as align with the global regulatory framework,” a spokesperson said. “Since setting our carbon neutral goal in 2018, our strategy has evolved progressively and now encompasses a nature-positive approach, including protecting and restoring biodiversity, investing in regenerative agriculture and supporting local communities,” it added. South Pole said climate neutrality claims had sometimes been misunderstood or misappropriated by companies, and said it stood against greenwashing, and had developed a stakeholder consolation about climate claims. It is consulting its clients on what should constitute a Paris-aligned corporate claim. In September, the airline easyJet announced it would stop offsetting carbon emissions from its planes, having previously used Verra’s rainforest offsets to claim its flights were “carbon neutral”, while the US airline JetBlue has also moved away from offsetting. Apple, which became the first company in the reach a $3tn market value last year and bought Verra rainforest offsets for its corporate carbon neutrality claim in 2022, said offsetting was just one part of its efforts alongside aggressive emission reductions and expanding renewable energy usage. It said nature-based offsets remained a part of its plans to make Apple products carbon neutral by the end of this decade. Major oil companies are some of the biggest buyers of carbon offsets to help meet their climate pledges while continuing to invest in fossil fuels. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that Shell, which is a major buyer of Verra carbon credits, has set aside more than $450m (£367m) to invest in “nature-based solutions”, which include carbon offsetting projects. A spokesperson for the oil company told the Guardian that although the carbon market “may not be perfectly functioning everywhere yet” it is still “an important enabler of emissions reduction”. It added that the market’s “imperfections” should not be “an excuse to disregard this viable and additional decarbonisation lever”. Shell said it disagreed with the analysis into Verra’s standards and was clear that all carbon offsetting should offer a “robust carbon benefit” by using “credible and independent standards”. Italy’s state-owned oil company, Eni, another major buyer of Verra-certified credits, told the Guardian that all its carbon offset credits were subject to due diligence based on “the highest control standards”. The company expects to continue using carbon offsets to meet 5% of the emissions reductions it plans to make in order to be net zero by 2050. BP has a business division dedicated to sourcing and trading carbon offset permits, including Verra-certified credits, some of which it has sold alongside cargos of liquified natural gas. The oil company has said that the “bundled carbon offset” product could help customers to meet their sustainability targets, but it does not refer to the offering as carbon neutral. BP has also said that it will not use carbon offsets to meet its own net zero targets. A BP spokesperson said the company was “actively participating in various initiatives focused on strengthening the quality of the voluntary carbon market”. “While we support the ability of companies to use carbon credits, especially to help address hard-to-abate emissions, BP has not purchased carbon credits for the purpose of meeting our net zero aims,” the spokesperson added.

    <head>From The New Boy to Asteroid City: 10 films to see at the 2023 Sydney film festival</head>
    <body>In decades to come, when historians reflect on a bygone form of social recreation known as “cinema-going”, I hope they’ll find room to include examples of film festival programs. They’re such wonderful snapshots of art, expression and the breadth of human experience. As usual, the program for this year’s Sydney film festival – running from 7 June to 18 June – is packed with treats for cineastes, containing more than 200 films screening across the city. Here are 10 suggestions. The New Boy Director: Warwick Thornton / Country: Australia ‘Thornton is the multi-hyphenate par excellence’: The New Boy Photograph: Supplied The Indigenous auteur Warwick Thornton – whose work includes Samson and Delilah, Sweet Country and The Beach – is one of Australia’s greatest film-makers, here teaming up with one of our greatest actors: Cate Blanchett. In the 40s-set The New Boy, which opens this year’s festival, Blanchett plays a nun running a remote monastery where a young orphan boy (newcomer Aswan Reid) arrives late at night. A rare example of a major writer/director who is also a cinematographer, Thornton is the multi-hyphenate par excellence. General release: TBC Asteroid City Director: Wes Anderson / Country: US Wes Anderson’s 11th feature film is set in 1955 in a fictional desert town Self-plagiarism is style, as Alfred Hitchcock famously said. Few directors are as distinctively stylish as Wes Anderson, whose 11th feature film is set in 1955 in a fictional desert town that hosts a Junior-Stargazer-slash-Space-Cadet convention. As usual, his cast is stacked with stars keen to be playthings in the kitschy Anderson dollhouse – including Tom Hanks, Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Margot Robbie, Steve Carell, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. General release: 22 June No Bears Director: Jafar Panahi / Country: Iran No Bears stars film-maker Jafar Panahi as a fictionalised version of himself Speaking of auteurs: another of the greats is the Iranian writer/director Jafar Panahi, whose films are playful, personal, political and coyly self-referential. The Iranian government banned Panahi from directing in 2010, but he’s found ways to sneak his work through the censors, including secretly filming Tehran Taxi in a cab and smuggling This Is Not a Film out of the country on a USB stick hidden in a birthday cake. His latest is No Bears, which collected the special jury prize at last year’s Venice film festival and stars Panahi as a fictionalised version of himself, remotely directing a film about a couple in Turkey attempting to acquire fake passports and flee the country. General release: TBC Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Hello Dankness Director: Soda Jerk / Country: Australia Hello Dankness repurposes footage from old and new films to reflect on the election of Donald Trump The two-person collective Soda Jerk (Sydney-born siblings Dan and Dominique Angeloro) create highly original work that, paradoxically, is almost entirely comprised of pre-existing materials. As I wrote in my review, Hello Dankness “uses remixing and reappropriation to jokily ponder the end of consensus reality – the idea that dramatic events of recent years have not just changed the course of human history but destroyed general agreement about what is real and what is not”. It repurposes footage from old and new films to reflect on the election of Donald Trump and the madness of a global pandemic. General release: TBC Smoke Sauna Sisterhood Director: Anna Hints / Country: Estonia, France, Ireland Who knew the world needed a film about woodland smoke saunas? I never realised until now that the world is terribly bereft of films about woodland smoke saunas in southern Estonia. This is one of the great virtues of cinema: to bring to the big screen visions of exotic places and situations. In this case, the hot and steamy kind. Anna Hints’ documentary visits a log cabin sauna where a group of women sweat, chat and bond, exchanging stories and secrets. General release: TBC 20,000 Species of Bees Director: Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren / Country: Spain 20,000 Species of Bees stars Sofía Otero as Cocó I also never realised until now that the world is terribly bereft of films set among beehives near the border between France and Spain. Peter Bradshaw observed a “gentleness and delicacy in this heartfelt family drama” starring Sofía Otero as Cocó, an eight-year-old who comes to realise her true gender identity. At nine years old, Otero became the youngest ever recipient of the Berlin film festival’s silver bear award. General release: TBC Sisu Director: Jalmari Helander / Country: Finland Sisu: ‘pure cinema run through a Nordic meat grinder’ Action-movie trailers don’t get much more badass than the extremely violent sizzle reel for this cranked-to-11 Finnish spectacle about a gold miner in the second world war who “lost his home and his family in the war” and “became a one-man death squad”. One critic entertainingly described it as “something akin to pure cinema run through a Nordic meat grinder”. Sold. Also: gross. General release: 27 July Reality Director: Tina Satter / Country: US The dialogue in Reality is taken from FBI interrogation transcripts In 2017, Reality Winner was arrested for leaking to the media a top-secret document detailing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The dialogue in Tina Satter’s film is taken entirely from FBI interrogation transcripts: a strange and interesting way to draw connection to real-life events. Winner is played by Sydney Sweeney – best known as Olivia, the snooty college sophomore from the first season of The White Lotus, as well as her award-winning turn as Euphoria’s Cassie. General release: 29 June Jane Campion retrospective Jane Campion will be in conversation with David Stratton Jane Campion’s magnum opus remains her 1993 masterpiece The Piano, which explores a recurring theme in her work: women on the fringes of social norms. But the New Zealand auteur has crafted many other fine films including Sweetie, In the Cut, Bright Star and An Angel at My Table. This year’s festival includes a retrospective of her work, with Campion appearing in person for a conversation with David Stratton. How to Blow Up a Pipeline Director: Daniel Goldhaber / Country: US How To Blow Up a Pipeline, in which activists assemble to sabotage an oil pipeline Director Daniel Goldhaber has described his fictionalised adaptation of Andreas Malm’s provocative nonfiction book as “Ocean’s Eleven about environmental activism”. A group of activists come together to sabotage a Texas oil pipeline, aware that their actions will blur the line between activism and terrorism. Wendy Ide called Goldhaber’s second film, following up his brilliant debut Cam, a “nervy thriller” that will act as “a lightning rod for the mounting anger of climate-conscious audiences that feel let down by government inaction on a looming global crisis”.

    <head>Anglicare asked to review procedures after royal commission finds it failed to report sexual assault</head>
    <body>Anglicare has been urged to immediately review its response to allegations of sexual abuse after a royal commission found it failed to report a woman’s assault to police and did not undertake a proper investigation. The disability royal commission heard last April that Niky* – who lives with a developmental disability – was sexually assaulted by another person with a disability at an Anglicare respite centre in Queensland in 2018. The perpetrator was found guilty and convicted that same year, but Anglicare took several years to offer Niky and her family a written apology for failing to report the assault. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A report by the royal commission found Anglicare “lacked a trauma-informed approach” and failed to support Niky appropriately. The organisation accepted the six findings made by the royal commission in the report, released on Tuesday, which found it did not conduct a comprehensive internal investigation, failed to follow mandatory reporting procedures and placed the burden of reporting on Niky and her parents. The report also found Anglicare failed to provide feedback to Niky’s parents and did not follow its own procedures to ensure she was supported to attend the nearest sexual assault service for initial counselling, medical examination and forensic sampling. The royal commission was also scathing of the fact that only one staff meeting was undertaken after the sexual assault, describing it as “insufficient” considering “the seriousness of the incident and the absence of Anglicare addressing risk factors”. Related: ‘Devastating’: woman with a disability met with disbelief after sexual assault, royal commission hears The report recommended that Anglicare immediately review the incident and its formal complaint procedures. Consultation with Niky and her parents about any further redress has also been recommended. In their submission to the royal commission, Anglicare said that it “recognises that it can and should do better”. “Anglicare acknowledges that its actions in relation to the standard practice and its own policies and procedures. Anglicare recognises that it can and should do better going forward in order to ensure it is able to provide safe, high-quality services,” the organisation said. “Anglicare apologises unreservedly to Niky and her family.” In unrelated allegations, the commission last week heard about teenage brothers who were discovered severely malnourished, naked and locked in a room with no food or furniture after their father died. The inquiry revealed that between June 2000 and May 2020, there were 30 occasions when concerns about neglect were raised with Queensland authorities, while 19 child protection notifications were received by the state’s Department of Child Safety. The commissioner, John Ryan, said that case involved a “whole heap of sliding-door moments where people might have recognised two young men who are in serious trouble and no one noticed”. *Name has been changed to protect the individual’s identity In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

    <head>Australia ‘diminished’: Penny Wong’s frenetic mission to repair regional ties</head>
    <body>A year ago, Penny Wong claimed the Coalition had “dropped the ball” in the Pacific. Now, as she marks one year as foreign affairs minister, Wong says Australia’s relationships across the region were in an even worse state than she initially believed. “The previous government did diminish Australia’s influence in the region – and the extent of that was greater than I had anticipated,” Wong says in an interview. That’s something she has been trying to rectify through extensive travel across the Pacific and south-east Asia, intended to make a “clear statement of our priorities in the region”. Related: These are the 10 points of tension Australia wants to reconcile with its defence strategic review | John Blaxland In her year in office, Australia’s tense relationship with China has thawed. But relations with Beijing remain a central focus, especially as fears grow about a potential conflict over Taiwan and China’s ambitions in the region. Reflecting on Beijing’s push for security agreements with Pacific countries, Wong says: “China’s ambitions are not going to change and it will do what great powers do, which is use every tool at their disposal to advance their interests in our region. “Australia’s interests lie in the region. And Australia’s interests lie in ensuring that the regional architecture and regional institutions are protected. And our engagement is predicated on that foundation.” Penny Wong holds a joint press conference with Samoa’s prime minister, Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, in Apia, Samoa, in June 2022. Wong praises Fiame as ‘a very committed regionalist’. Photograph: Dept of Foreign Affairs/AP An ‘investment in regional security’ A lot of media coverage focuses on the contest for influence between the US, Australia and New Zealand on one side and China on the other – undeniably a major factor in the government’s push to keep the mantle as a “partner of choice”. The trigger for Wong saying the Coalition had dropped the ball was China signing a security agreement with Solomon Islands which was widely seen as leading the way for a Chinese military and police presence in the country. Shortly after Australia’s 2022 election, China attempted but was rebuffed in seeking a sweeping security and economic deal with 10 Pacific countries. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Related: Australia told to end new fossil fuel subsidies if it wants Pacific support to host climate summit But Wong says it is wrong to view everything Australia does in the region through that geostrategic lens. She points to last week’s budget package of $1.9bn over five years as being a result of listening to the Pacific’s priorities. The plan includes the expansion of the Pacific Australia labour mobility scheme, an increase in diplomatic staff in the region, disaster relief and expansion of maritime security ties and criminal justice cooperation. Pacific island countries have repeatedly said they don’t want to be reduced to pawns in a geopolitical chess game. They also view the climate crisis as their top security threat – a point that Wong has acknowledged, even as leaders in the region call for curbs on coal and gas. Wong has used the Albanese government’s new 2030 emission reduction targets – now enshrined in legislation and stronger than the Morrison government’s commitments – as a bridge to signal to the Pacific that Australia is listening. Labor believes Tony Abbott’s cuts to foreign aid and an incident in Canberra in which senior Coalition ministers were caught joking about “water lapping at your door” in the Pacific didn’t help Australia’s standing. “The reason we invest is not only that we are part of the Pacific family, not only that it is the right thing to do, but it is recognising that Australians are more secure in a region that is stable,” Wong says. “So this is an investment in regional stability, which in turn makes us more secure.” The rocky relationship with China At the same time as it seeks to boost its regional influence, the Australian government has been seeking to “stabilise” the rocky relationship with China, its top trading partner. Wong travelled to Beijing in December to mark the 50th anniversary of the Whitlam government opening diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China and the trade minister, Don Farrell, flew there late last week, without gaining any apparent concessions. Wong raised human rights and the plight of detained Australians Cheng Lei and Yang Hengjun during her meeting with her then counterpart, Wang Yi. She won’t reveal what reaction she received from Wang, but promises that the Australian government “will continue to call for them to be reunited with their families”. “This is an issue that we have elevated in terms of the bilateral relationship. It’s something the prime minister has raised and I have raised and we will continue to raise.” Related: ADF to expand Pacific links in $1.9bn budget package to boost Australia’s influence The government has yet to confirm plans for China’s new foreign minister, Qin Gang, to visit Australia in the coming months, but Wong is firm in the belief that dialogue is important: “Engagement enables us to speak, even where there is disagreement, to pursue our national interests.” Penny Wong meets Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang, on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in New Delhi, India on 2 March. Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock But she also warns that the relationship won’t be going back to what it was 15 years ago when economic ties with China could be neatly compartmentalised from security and broader strategic issues. “We understand that there are areas where we cooperate; we also understand there are areas where we will disagree. And the new normal, to sort of put it in the vernacular, is really both countries making decisions to manage those differences wisely.” ‘The riskiest of flashpoints in our region’ One issue on which this government has changed tack from the previous Morrison government is to not publicly speculate about Australian involvement in a potential future war over Taiwan, the self-governed democracy of 24 million people that China views as a wayward province and hasn’t ruled out taking by force. Wong admits that Taiwan is “the riskiest of flashpoints in our region” and says that is why it “has to be handled responsibly”. Related: Singapore backs Aukus and says Australia could play ‘bigger role’ in regional security But while the former defence minister, Peter Dutton, said it would be “inconceivable” that Australia would not join a US-led defence of Taiwan, Guardian Australia understands that Wong conveyed a message to senior officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade after the election that they should not view a war over Taiwan as an inevitable outcome. The minister doesn’t deny that she expressed that message to her department, but says she “worked quite hard on the Taiwan section” of her recent National Press Club address. “The point I was making in the speech, and I have made this publicly and privately, is that when it comes to Taiwan, the scenario which most enables continued peace is the status quo. And maintaining that status quo will require work and it will require both deterrence and reassurance. “And what we ought not do is to talk up the inevitability of conflict. Rather, we should be working out what we should be saying and doing publicly and privately to provide that deterrence and reassurance.” Australia recognises ‘our own agency’ Asked whether the government faces a problem persuading the Labor rank-and-file over the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan and other big strategic calls, Wong studiously avoids getting into a fresh war of words with former prime minister Paul Keating. But her message is unmissable: the times “differ from those which Australia has lived in over the decades since world war two”. She says it is good for the country to have a discussion about how to navigate those “very different circumstances”. She pushes back strongly at claims Australia acts as a US proxy in the region. “We are a US ally and we’re clear about that. What I would say, though, is that Australia recognises our own agency and our own sovereignty. And we also recognise the role we have to play.” One of Wong’s most regular refrains has been to urge China and the US to put in place “guardrails” to responsibly manage their tensions. Wong notes the US role in the region is changing – and the outcome Australia is trying to avoid is “one power dominating such that the choices that countries like Australia and others can make are constrained”. Related: Drawing closer to US while seeking warmer China ties leaves Australia with a tough balancing act After Wong flies from Laos to the Philippines on Tuesday, she will have visited every member of the Pacific Island Forum and every member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) except for military-ruled Myanmar in her first year in office. Despite her concerns about the erosion of Australia’s standing over the past decade, Wong says “the openness to engage with us has been really heartwarming”, adding that her travel was to make “a clear statement of our priorities”. Wong initially says she “would anticipate a different intensity of travel over the next year” – but then she stops to look at her diary. The minister lets out a nervous laugh. “I’m not sure it’s much less to be honest.”</body>

    <head>Australian banks announce new anti-fraud platform to help quickly freeze scam payments</head>
    <body>Australian banks have announced a platform that will help them act quickly to freeze money being sent to scammers by allowing the reporting of bank-to-bank scam payments in close to real time. On Tuesday the Australian Banking Association announced the new Fraud Reporting Exchange (FRX) platform, which will facilitate the quick reporting of fraudulent payments as they are transferred to another bank. The move will boost “the likelihood that funds can be frozen and returned to customers”, the association said in a statement. Related: Australians are being bled dry. Banks must use their windfall profits to help tackle the scam crisis The new platform will give banks the ability to halt multiple fraudulent transactions taking place as part of the same scam, share intelligence to assist with loss-prevention efforts and offer a streamlined return of funds where possible. “Given every minute can be crucial in disrupting scams, the launch of the FRX is a major development,” the Australian Banking Association’s (ABA) chief executive, Anna Bligh, said. “It means more and more scammers are going to hit a brick wall and adds to the arsenal of anti-scam initiatives under way.” So far 17 banks, including the big four, have signed up to the platform, with a trial showing the time to resolve scam cases dropped by more than half. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Banks are now better placed to jointly identify funds which have been fraudulently transferred, which should improve their ability to prevent any further losses to a customer,” Bligh said. Bligh said it is imperative that consumers report a fraudulent or scam payment to their bank as soon as possible. “The sooner that banks know about a fraud, the sooner they can take swift action to try to halt the payment before it gets to the scammers.” Australians lost over $3bn to scams in 2022 alone, with many victims losing funds because they are transferred via different banks, making them difficult to track. The government announced $58m on Monday to fund a national anti-scams centre, which will report scams and distribute information to banks, law enforcement and vulnerable communities. Consumer rights groups have welcomed the new platform but say it will not do enough to prevent scams and are calling on the government to implement a policy that would see banks reimburse scam victims. The CEO of the Consumer Action Law Centre, Stephanie Tonkin, said the “investment by the industry is really fantastic” but banks should be “preventing scams from reaching consumers in the first place”. “The recent Asic report showed that the major banks were reimbursing just 2-5% of scams losses last year,” she said. “I think that’s well below what customers will be expecting. “Until we financially incentivise the banks through mandatory laws … then we’re probably not going to see that much of a difference.”</body>

    <head>Germany’s change of heart is now pivotal to the war in Ukraine. Here’s why</head>
    <body>Unlike British or French politicians, Olaf Scholz doesn’t do pomp. Nor does he do charm. A man who screws up his eyes when he tries to smile, the German chancellor welcomed Ukraine’s president to Berlin on Sunday with characteristic stiffness. Yet of all Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s meetings with fellow European leaders over the past few days – from Rome to Paris to Chequers today for more hardware and more embraces with Rishi Sunak – his day in Germany may be remembered as the most important. The announcement on the eve of his visit of a doubling of military aid to Ukraine to a total of more than €5bn finally brings Germany in from the cold. The consequences may take months to be seen on the battlefield, but in geo-strategic terms they are immediate. Zelenskiy knows that he has perhaps only six to eight months for his counteroffensive to make sufficient inroads to force Russia out of the areas it seized in 2022 and, better still, out of lands it annexed in 2014. Doing this would also demonstrate to the west the effectiveness of the support given so far. He knows that if he cannot finish the job this year, he will have to continue into next year in even more difficult circumstances. He sees the Chinese, the French and others showboating diplomacy not necessarily on Ukraine’s terms. At the same time he is aware that public opinion in several countries is wavering. Most of all, he sees the lumbering figure of Donald Trump coming into view. Even the prospect of a return to the White House of a man who cannot say which side he supports provides succour to Vladimir Putin and the forces on the far right and far left in Europe who put the vague notion of “peace” ahead of international law, self-determination and human rights. That is why the debate in Europe, and Germany in particular, is so important. Germans are told to pull their weight but not to throw their weight about. They pride themselves on Vergangenheitsbewältigung, their coming to terms with their past. Yet in recent years among some sections of society, particularly Scholz’s Social Democrats, one wrong lesson was learned. These “salon pacifists” reinterpreted the phrase “never again” to mean never again going to war, rather than never confronting tyranny. The terrible invasion of Iraq reinforced that view. Ukraine has now shattered that, inserting a concept alien to several generations of “the good war”. But it has required two heaves to get there. The first was the Zeitenwende, the speech Scholz gave three days after Putin’s invasion in which he declared a new approach to hard power and an extra €100bn to be spent on reinforcing Germany’s ailing armed forces. Having broken the mould so dramatically, the German chancellor returned to type, second-guessing each step, fearful of a backlash from his party. Relations became so toxic that the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was prevented by the Ukrainians at the last moment from visiting Kyiv. Zelenskiy feted all-comers but froze out the Germans, who complained they were not getting the credit for being one of the largest donors of military aid, amounting to more than €2bn. The problem was that it was offered grudgingly and delivered slowly. Tensions reached a high in the autumn over the stalled delivery of German-made Leopard 2 tanks. Not only did Scholz refuse to send them, but he also held back re-export licences to Ukraine by other countries of the tanks. He eventually relented, arguing that his position had forced the Americans to release tanks too. Related: What happens when leaders disregard the truth? Putin and Trump are about to find out | Peter Pomerantsev So why this change of heart and is it irrevocable? Several factors in recent months have transformed the relationship between Germany and Ukraine. One is the appointment of Boris Pistorius, the first defence minister in years to get to grips with the transformation required to make Germany the major military player Nato needs it to be. Speaking at a conference last week, one of Germany’s leading diplomats, Thomas Bagger, who will shortly take over as the top official at the foreign ministry, said: “My country is now on a path to correct what in hindsight was its biggest mistake.” Announcing the new €3bn package of measures for Ukraine, Pistorius declared: “Germany will provide all the help it can, for as long as it takes.” People around Scholz argue that if he had been more gung-ho, he would not have brought the German people with him. Meanwhile, his foreign ministry and now his defence ministry are showing greater mettle, not just towards Russia, but also in navigating the increasingly difficult dilemma about China as a business opportunity and a security threat. On Sunday evening, Zelenskiy was in the beautiful medieval city of Aachen to receive the Charlemagne prize for services to Europe. Before an audience of luminaries, he spoke not just about the war but about Ukraine’s place in the European Union. That is why, if – and it remains a huge if – Ukraine prevails and wins the war, its biggest goal will be accession to the EU, and the role of Germany (and France and Poland) will be so pivotal. The UK, sadly, will not be at the table. As for Scholz, every time he was referred to warmly by Zelenskiy in his speech (“my friend Olaf”), the chancellor appeared to fidget with his headphones or tie. He may not be able to do human, but he is the most important human being the Ukrainians will have to do business with.

    <head>Mikel Arteta must improve Arsenal’s strength in depth in summer revamp</head>
    <body>It felt like a throwback to darker days when Mikel Arteta, wan and downcast, faced the media after his side’s destruction by Brighton. There have been few reasons for dejection this season and, even after draws or defeats, he has generally emphasised the sunny aspects of Arsenal’s revival. This time, though, there was the clear sense a title dream had died and the note Arteta struck was bleak. “If a team is capable of doing that when it comes to the biggest stage, there’s a lot of things to analyse and think about because it cannot happen,” he said ominously, subsequently reiterating they were short of the level needed to compete for honours domestically and in the Champions League. Related: ‘It feels like there is no hope’: Ødegaard all but concedes title after Arsenal loss To an extent that is nothing new: Arsenal were always going to require a revamp this summer and there is little question they have overperformed according to their playing resources. The manner of their drop-off is best observed by chopping their season in two. During the first 19 games, up to and including the dramatic win against Manchester United in January, they won 50 points at an average of 2.63 per match; the following 17 have brought 31 points at an average of 1.82. Arsenal spent the first half of the campaign in the vein of runaway champions and the second in form befitting a side that would usually finish somewhere between third and sixth. The difference is stark, although some degree of tail-off might have been expected from a young team in that position for the first time. It will make frustrating reading for Arteta, who could bemoan injuries but knows they cannot account for everything. Gabriel Jesus and William Saliba have been missed at different points of the campaign, and Takehiro Tomiyasu’s versatility would have come in useful this spring. Yet the treatment room has never been overflowing and the squad must be better stocked if they are to see the job through in future. Numbers have been less of a problem than quality. Saliba required a higher-grade deputy than Rob Holding or Jakub Kiwior, although the latter’s performances in recent weeks have shown genuine promise; out wide there is no semblance of serious competition for Bukayo Saka, who has been muted of late; Fábio Vieira is not ready to swap in regularly for Martin Ødegaard if required; up front there appears a vacancy for a striker of real stature who can present an alternative to Jesus; and at left-back Kieran Tierney, a fine player but incomparable to Oleksandr Zinchenko in Arteta’s preferred buildup, has seen the team evolve beyond him. The Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta pictured during their 3-0 defeat by Brighton. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP To keep up the pace in 2023-24, Arteta will need better alternatives, individuals whose rotation into the side will not diminish the effectiveness. That will mean more established players and, in order to attract them, a greater willingness from the manager to chop and change. He wants Saka to be capable of playing more than 60 games a season but it would surely do no harm if someone of comparable gifts, maybe Bayer Leverkusen’s Moussa Diaby, were ready to start at least a third of them. Perhaps Jesus would take less of a buffeting if a first-rate centre-forward were available to soften up defences when deemed necessary. Saliba, who is yet to agree a new contract, could do with cover of equivalent virtuosity. The area of greatest interest may, in fact, be the one in which Arsenal are laden with experience. Jorginho, Thomas Partey and Granit Xhaka will be 31, 30 and 30 respectively when next season starts; Mohamed Elneny, around for another year as backup when fit, also turns 31 soon. It is little secret that Arsenal would like to sign Declan Rice; arguably there would be room too for another long-term target, Moisés Caicedo, to restore the age balance if funds permit. That would surely mean a senior figure moving on. Arteta paid tribute to Xhaka last Friday, hailing “probably the best season he has had at the club”, but there is a feeling that both parties may see sense in ending on a high. Arsenal should bring in more than £80m if Tierney, Holding, Xhaka and the unfortunate Emile Smith Rowe depart along with well‑regarded younger players such as Folarin Balogun and Charlie Patino. Their transfer window pot is expected to be substantial and Arteta will search for additions who hit the sweet spot between ready‑made talent and a higher ceiling. Perhaps he will also wonder whether opponents figured out elements of Arsenal’s approach at the halfway mark. They have been vulnerable to an aggressive press in recent weeks and, with that, sloppy in building from the back. Goals conceded against Southampton and Brighton, along with what may have been a season-changing penalty award for West Ham a month ago, were directly linked to errors in first-phase buildup. Further forward Jesus has spent much of his time marshalled into less dangerous areas and Saka, while a huge threat going inside or out, has more often been ushered to the byline on his weaker right foot than permitted to cut inside and let rip with his left. Jorginho is one of several Arsenal midfielders over the age of 30. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images In a league of few secrets, Arteta must conjure up fresh surprises. Next year they can expect an enhanced threat from Newcastle and it is impossible to imagine at least one of Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea not straightening up. “You have to do a lot of good things, incredible things, to be second in this league, and we’ve done that,” Arteta said before returning to problem‑solving mode. History will agree with him but it may also judge Arsenal’s long-term viability as contenders by their response to the near miss that so dispirited the manager.</body>

    <head>Suella Braverman rails against ‘experts and elites’ in partisan speech</head>
    <body>Suella Braverman has railed against “experts and elites” and what she called the divisive politics of identity, in a highly partisan speech that is likely to be viewed as setting out ideas for a post-election Conservative leadership bid. Addressing the National Conservatism conference in Westminster, the home secretary made comments trailed in advance about the need for the UK to cut back on legal migration and train domestic workers for jobs such as fruit picking. The speech, which was interrupted by two Extinction Rebellion protesters who were marched from the hall, otherwise largely steered clear of specific policy areas. Instead, Braverman set out a highly personal blueprint for a political philosophy to take on the “radical left”, including the Labour party. Braverman argued that conservatism “has no truck with political correctness”, in a section of the speech that squarely addressed culture war issues. “The ethnicity of grooming gang perpetrators is the sort of fact that has become unfashionable in some quarters,” she said. “Much like the fact that 100% of women do not have a penis. It is absurd that we find ourselves in a situation where this a remotely controversial statement.” In one of a series of attacks on Keir Starmer, Braverman said that “given his definition of a woman, we can’t rule him out from running to be Labour’s first female prime minister”. On a similar theme, Braverman said those on the left “are ashamed of our history and embarrassed by the sentiments and desires expressed by the British public”. She said: “I think the left can only sell its vision for the future by making people feel terrible about our past. White people do not exist in a special state of sin or collective guilt. Nobody should be blamed for things that happened before they were born. The defining feature of this country’s relationship with slavery is not that we practised it, but that we led the way in abolishing it.” Beginning with a description of her father’s arrival from Kenya in 1968, and her mother’s move from Mauritius to train as a nurse, Braverman said her politics, like that of her parents, was “a politics of optimism, pride, national unity, aspiration, and realism”. She continued: “The left’s is a politics of pessimism, guilt, national division, resentment and utopianism. The left on the other hand sees the purpose of politics as to eradicate the existence of inequality, even if that comes at the expense of individual liberty and human flourishing.” Attacking identity politics, Braverman said it was “the politics of grievance and division – it is illiberal and incompatible with social cohesion.” In apparent criticism of academics and other advisers, Braverman said Conservatives should be “sceptical of self-appointed gurus, experts and elites who think they know best what is in the public’s interest, even when that public is quite certain that they need something different from what those experts are proposing.” She added: “Common sense and a shared understanding of who we are and what really matters in life have vastly more to recommend themselves than does anything that emanates from an ivory tower.” Braverman warned against the UK descending into a US-style culture war that pitted various elements of the right against each other. “I suspect the form it takes in the UK will naturally differ in some ways to the form it’s taken in the US,” she said. “But having observed events in the US in recent years, I do want to sound a note of caution. One way that we Conservatives must distinguish ourselves from the left is by not devouring ourselves through fratricide.”</body>

    <head>What are Labour’s plans for giving foreign nationals the right to vote?</head>
    <body>Keir Starmer’s plan to extend the right to vote in a general election to foreign nationals has been politically polarising. Many see it is a fundamental democratic right; others have seized on it as a leftwing plot to reverse Brexit. The Conservative party chair, Greg Hands, accused the Labour leader of a plot to “rig the electorate”, while his predecessor in the role, Nadhim Zahawi, claimed it was a move to “soften the nation” to get the UK back into the EU. What is the plan and is it really radical thinking? The Labour party is working on a package of proposals that includes extending voting rights to about 5 million EU citizens and other non-nationals permanently residing in the country. At the same time, it is considering changing the law to allow over-16s to vote. Starmer has said it “feels wrong” to exclude EU citizens who live and pay tax in the UK from general elections. But the proposal is to extend the vote to all non-citizens settled in the country, not just those from the EU. What has Starmer said about those affected? Starmer has said it does not pass the “common sense test” that settled migrants who have worked in the UK for decades do not have full voting rights. “The thinking behind it is if someone’s been here say 10, 20, 30 years, contributing to this economy, contributing to the community, they ought to be able to vote,” he said. On 16- and 17-year-olds, Starmer said: “They can have babies, they can work, they can join the army, so there are big things you can do at 16 and 17. And again, it’s not such an outlandish idea. In Wales it already happens, in Scotland it already happens.” How many would it affect? It could bring about 6.5 million new voters on stream. The total number of EU citizens with settled or pre-settled status in the UK is 6.2 million, of whom 5 million are over 18 years old. If Labour comes to power and gives EU citizens and 16- and 17-year-olds the vote, this could swell to about 6.5 million. Irish nationals and qualifying Commonwealth citizens, who do not require leave to enter or remain in the UK, can already vote in all British elections as a result of historic ties. Interactive How would this come about? The law would have to be changed, which could involve a new act of parliament, given the controversy over the issue. Can foreign nationals vote in general elections in other countries? Foreign nationals are generally not allowed to vote in general elections. This is the case in the US and across the EU. What about British nationals who are not resident? UK citizens living outside the country should soon be able to continue to vote in British elections even if they have been overseas for more than 15 years. Secondary legislation to give effect to the overseas voting rights in the Elections Act 2022 is still to be laid, however. What about local elections? Before Brexit, EU citizens had the right to vote in local and European parliament elections. After the Elections Act 2022, EU citizens who come to the UK in future, or who settled in the UK after 1 January 2021 when Brexit came into force, will not be able to vote in local elections or stand for public office. Are there exceptions? Irish and Commonwealth citizens maintain local election voting rights. So too do citizens of Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg and Poland, after bilateral agreements that also enable British citizens settled in those countries to vote in local elections in their towns and cities.</body>

    <head>Mormon church has $100bn ‘clandestine hedge fund’, says whistleblower</head>
    <body>A former investment manager for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says that the organization stockpiled more than $100bn in funding intended for charity work but never spent it on such projects. “It was really a clandestine hedge fund,” David A Nielsen said during an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes. “Once the money went in, it didn’t go out.” Related: Ex-members of extremist Mormon sect plead for help to find missing children Nielsen, who submitted a complaint to the Internal Revenue Service in 2019, previously managed the church’s investment arm, Ensign Peak Advisors, for nine years. A report on the complaint to the top US tax authority was published by the Washington Post in 2019 after Nielsen’s brother provided a copy. Nielsen, a devout Mormon himself, was first recruited to work for Ensign Peak while working on Wall Street. Nielsen said that during his time with Ensign Peak, he observed the church’s investment firm “[masquerading] as a charity”, dodging what would be billions of dollars in taxes by falsifying records, and generally misleading other believers of the Mormon faith. Every year, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints collected an estimated $7bn from its 17 million members through a practice known as tithing, in which members give about 10% of their income to the religious organization. About $1bn of the collected money was placed into a reserve fund at Ensign Peak – which is registered as a non-profit – and invested, with profits growing tax-free. Created in 1997, the reserve fund has ballooned to more than $100bn, which is nearly twice the size of Harvard’s endowment, Nielsen said. “I thought we were going to change the world,” Nielsen remarked. “We just grew the bank account.” Records show that money from the church’s reserve fund was used to support for-profit initiatives, including a Salt Lake City mall built on church land and a church-owned insurance company. Nielsen resigned in 2019 after a website named Mormon Leaks linked church members to shell companies that held billions of dollars in stocks and bonds, assets that were actually controlled by Ensign Peak. After his resignation, Nielsen filed a 74-page whistleblower complaint to the IRS that accused Ensign Peak of violating its tax-exempt status by directing money to for-profit businesses. Nielsen’s complaint was later forwarded to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said the church took great lengths to hide the size of its investments through shell companies and fake office addresses, the Washington Post reported. The church paid $5m to resolve its SEC case in February. The Mormon church official W Christopher Waddell, who oversees the organization’s financial, real estate, investment and charitable operations as the first counselor in the presiding bishopric, vehemently denied Nielsen’s accusations. “Flat-out wrong,” said Waddell, who added that Ensign Peak acted as “the church’s treasury” and provided resources for its operation. Nielsen’s interview with 60 Minutes is one of the first times he has given public comment on the report. “We gave the IRS and the SEC all the professional courtesy,” Nielsen said. “This is just too important to fall through the cracks.” But experts say that the likelihood of the IRS investigating Nielsen’s claims is low. “The political risk is so great that it comes with real danger,” former IRS official Phil Hackney said during the 60 Minutes segment. “At the same time, there’s a real risk to the rule of law if the IRS doesn’t come in and enforce those rules.”</body>

    <head>Why enjoy the sunshine when you could torment yourself in a shopping centre?</head>
    <body>It was the first beautiful day of 2023 and everyone in the country was in a park, except for me. I was in Westfield’s west London outpost, in Shepherd’s Bush. I’m not allowed to write about the kids any more – I’ve had article eight of the Human Rights Act thrown at me – so let’s just say that two children belonging to someone else made me do it. I hadn’t set foot in the place since 30 October 2008, when I covered its opening, which was newsworthy because it was the largest covered shopping centre in the UK. Boris Johnson had recently been elected as mayor of London; the country was yet to clock how tragic the consequences of that would be. He was at the opening, but I missed him because I ran into my school friend’s mum. Everything has changed, everything has remained the same. Well, there are a load of Korean wares now – bubble tea, makeup – which is why this stranger’s children forced me there in the first place, but the M&amp;S is still standing. John Lewis is there now, but these days is happy to be knowingly undersold, having dropped its 97-year-old slogan last year, although you wouldn’t notice to look around. You would just think: “Is the market for slacks and Le Creuset pepper grinders still that hot?” Oh, there has been one other change, just a small thing, really: all our underpinning assumptions about capitalism. We don’t even call it that any more, we call it “late capitalism”, a phrase I used to like, because it made it sound like it was nearly over, but now hate, because it makes it sound exploitative and discourteous. When this place opened, it had a strong tang of metaphor: it was so shiny yet so windowless, so vast yet so repetitive, that you felt blessed to be allowed in and also completely disoriented, separated from any sense of place, unconscious of time. Have I been here an hour or a day? Is Johnson still around? Would a proper newshound try to find him or was that so long ago that he is in the Cotswolds now? How far have I walked, to get from that shoe shop to this very similar one? Am I hungry or just empty? Headlines called it things like a “temple of consumerism”. Lehman Brothers had collapsed only a few weeks before and it felt like the brink of a new era. Bankers would be put in prison, surely; we would realise that financialisation was destroying prosperity; 30 years of free market fundamentalism would have to give way to a leftwing agenda of redistribution and equality, which someone must have ready to go. We have been to enough meetings. What a weird time to open a temple of consumerism – at the very moment when materialism was about to topple off its plinth, like that statue of Saddam Hussein. And yet, what a perfect time to open a place full of stuff you don’t need that baffles the senses. We had been living in a cheap-debt dream and we were about to wake up. If you had told me then that the financial crash would be paid for entirely by regular people – who didn’t even know what a collateralised debt obligation was until five minutes before, yet saw their incomes stagnate and their public services decline for years, with the result that, 15 years hence, the whole OECD is living in a necropolitical nightmare, the violent fantasies of government rhetoric our only fireworks in a landscape of grinding penury – I would have … well, I don’t know what I would have done. But I definitely wouldn’t have lost an unknowable number of hours asking my friend’s mum how her extended family was doing in Cork. I would have been more worried. Westfield still has an air of timelessness, with an additional layer of confusion now that there are Bentleys parked on the concourse, so you don’t know whether you are indoors or outdoors. It’s still a metaphor for something, although I can’t yet tell you what. I’ll come back to you in 15 years. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</body>

    <head>Royal Mail faces possible fine as regulator looks into late deliveries</head>
    <body>The communications regulator has launched an investigation into poor performance at Royal Mail that could lead to a fine after more than a quarter of first-class mail was not delivered on time. Ofcom said it would examine the postal service operator’s failure to meet targets during a year marked by a long-running industrial dispute, which led to the resignation of the chief executive on Friday. Royal Mail is required to deliver 93% of first class mail within one working day of collection and 98.5% of second class mail within three working days. Its workers are also required to complete 99.9% of routes on each day that a delivery is required. However, the 507-year-old service has revealed that – over the last year excluding Christmas – only 73.7% of first class mail was delivered on target, 90.7% for second class and only 89.4% of delivery routes had been completed. The regulator said on Monday: “Ofcom takes compliance with the quality-of-service targets very seriously.” It will now study whether there are “reasonable grounds for believing that Royal Mail has failed to comply with its obligations”. Ofcom added: “In deciding whether the company is in breach of its obligations, we will consider if there were any exceptional events – beyond the company’s control – that may have explained why it missed its targets. “If it does not provide a satisfactory explanation and we determine that Royal Mail has failed to comply with its obligations, we may consider whether to impose a financial penalty.” Late last year, the regulator told Royal Mail it could no longer use the pandemic as an “excuse for poor delivery performance”. The in-depth review will run alongside Ofcom’s regular annual study of Royal Mail’s performance. The Royal Mail chief executive, Simon Thompson, said on Friday that he would step down from the role, which he took up just over two years ago, after a bruising, year-long dispute with the Communication Workers Union over pay and working conditions. A deal with the union was agreed last month after 18 days of strike action and will be voted on at the end of this month. Royal Mail’s owner, International Distributions Services, is due to report its annual results on Thursday. The company’s delivery performance came under scrutiny from the Commons business select committee, amid evidence that the company was prioritising delivering parcels over letters. Royal Mail has spent much of the last decade attempting to revamp the business to cope with the long-term decline in the posting of letters and the rapid increase in online shopping, fuelling increased volumes and competition in the more lucrative parcels market. Thompson becomes the latest in a succession of Royal Mail bosses to leave after drawn out conflict with unions over implementing change into the business, which was privatised in 2013.</body>

    <head>Ukraine strikes Russian forces in Luhansk before expected counteroffensive</head>
    <body>Ukraine has carried out further strikes on Russian forces on Monday, apparently targeting Russian command and control centres deep behind enemy lines ahead of its long-awaited counteroffensive, with explosions reported in the occupied city of Luhansk. Smoke was seen rising above a former aviation school in the eastern city, used by the Russian military. Moscow-installed local officials said Kyiv carried out the attack with two Storm Shadow long-range missiles, supplied by the British. An administrative building was damaged, they said. The strike follows a similar attack on Saturday in Luhansk that destroyed a multi-storey building and lightly wounded a Russian MP. Russian state media showed off fragments that it said came from Storm Shadow rockets. There was a further explosion on Monday in the city centre. The blast took place in a crowded barber’s shop. The Luhansk “people’s republic” interior minister, Major Gen Igor Kornet, was seriously wounded, apparently while getting his hair cut. One person was killed and five others injured. Igor Kornet, the Luhansk ‘people’s republic’ interior minister, was seriously wounded in a blast. Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters Luhansk – effectively controlled by Russia since 2014 – had been relatively peaceful since Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion last year. The provision of Storm Shadow missiles, which have a range in excess of 250km, means it is suddenly vulnerable, together with Russian bases and arms depots stationed well away from the fighting. On Monday, the Kremlin said for the first time it had shot down one of the air-launched British cruise missiles, together with other western-supplied rockets. There was no independent verification of the claim. Storm Shadow missiles are hard to detect using radar and carry a powerful 500kg warhead. In recent days, Ukrainian commanders have been carrying out tactical “shaping” operations across a 900-mile frontline, which runs from Kherson province in the south to the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east. They have been systematically destroying enemy artillery systems and armoured vehicles, often in nighttime missions using drones. The latest attacks on Luhansk suggest Kyiv is simultaneously targeting Russian command and control centres, before a general counteroffensive expected this summer. The apparent plan is to degrade Russia’s battlefield potential, in the run-up to an advance by newly formed Ukrainian battalions equipped with western main battle tanks. Ukraine’s long-range strike capability is a growing problem for Moscow’s military command. Vladimir Putin’s press spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia took an “extremely negative” view of the UK’s decision to give Kyiv more military hardware, including long-range attack drones announced during Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the UK on Monday, when he met Rishi Sunak at Chequers. Russia’s general staff experienced a similar strategic setback last summer when the US gave truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers to Kyiv, with an 80km range. These precision Himars systems were used to blow up bridges over the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine, forcing Moscow to abandon the city of Kherson, and to retreat from the right to the left bank. Related: ‘We’ll get there’: the Ukrainian drone unit quietly knocking out Russian targets Writing on Telegram, Igor Girkin – a far-right nationalist and former Russian intelligence colonel – said the recent delivery of Storm Shadows “can seriously affect the situation at the front”. “They can effectively hit headquarters, ammunition depots and personal quarters in our deep rear,” he acknowledged, saying “electronic warfare” did not work against them. Last week, Ukrainian troops recaptured more than 10 sq miles of territory around the eastern city of Bakhmut, in the first significant advance for months. There were reports of continued street fighting in the city centre on Monday, with Russian infantry units and mercenaries from the Wagner group attempting to storm Ukrainian positions. Ukraine controls a small sliver of territory in the west of Bakhmut. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the defence of Bakhmut continued. Recent local advances on both flanks of the city showed that Ukraine could move forward and counter Russian forces there, he said on Monday.</body>

    <head>Arsenal, the Premier League title race and charges of ‘bottling’</head>
    <body>GUN AND DUSTED No sooner had Roberto De Zerbi wiped the grass stains from his knees following Brighton’s not entirely surprising humbling of Arsenal than Social Media Abomination Twitter and the airwaves were humming with accusations that Arsenal had, in some way, “bottled” the title. Indeed, even some of their own fans had streamed out of the Emirates well before the final whistle, assuming that the jig was up not only against the Seagulls but against Manchester City too. On a run of 11 consecutive league wins, Pep Guardiola’s side might not even need another from their last three games to take a fifth title in six years, but will probably get it anyway in their final home game against Chelsea, despite the managerial savvy of the man in the away team’s technical area. As the dejected players of Arsenal lay or hunkered down on the turf after being schooled by Sunday’s visitors, your Ødegaards, your Ramsdales, your Xhakas and your Sakas could have been forgiven for pondering what might have been during an April horribilis, in which they squandered two-goal leads against Liverpool and West Ham, before allowing Southampton to go goal crazy in what would prove their body’s final twitch before relegation as the worst team in the division. “I hate the feeling of letting people down when they are expecting something,” seethed Mikel Arteta, who has clearly never been tasked with dispatching a funny [ahem? – Football Daily Ed] and vaguely informative daily football email to a large audience. “That’s the biggest regret and I have to apologise for that. Second position is secure and that is not going to change but this result is going to take me a few days to digest.” The Europe-bound Seagulls. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images Despite the charges of “bottling” while looking on course to claim a championship nobody in their right mind expected them to win nine months ago, it could be argued that Arteta and his players are being too hard on themselves for a number of reasons. The most obvious, regularly overlooked one, is that Manchester City are demonstrably better at football than they are and have a far greater number of excellent players at their disposal. They are a relentless winning machine, engineered in a bespoke laboratory at eye-watering expense to the detailed specifications of an elite manager who, with the possible exception of Tony Mowbray, is almost certainly the best in his field and possesses a preposterous strength in depth that is the envy of all his rivals. In short, City are so good that even if Arsenal hadn’t slipped up in those games against Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton, there is zero guarantee the extra six points they’d have accumulated would have been enough to see them over the line and crowned champions. That’s what they and everyone else are up against, even before one’s gaze is directed towards that herd of 100 or more elephants in the room that many broadcasters, pundits and reporters have been studiously avoiding any mention of since they first started trumpeting three months ago. While the prevailing wisdom seems to be that Arsenal will learn from this season’s experience, strengthen and kick on, there is little to say the exact same thing won’t happen with City’s imperious team of serial winners.

The celebration is normal, but it was respectful to go to the booth because we were not at home. I am rational. But emotions are difficult to control. We celebrated it not because we were in Espanyol’s camp but for the title … we haven’t provoked anyone. We were celebrating a league that is very important to us” – Xavi tries to cool things down after Barcelona’s championship party was just that little too on the nose for relegation-threatened foes Espanyol, whose fans chased them off the pitch.

So it was interesting to see Sam Allardyce invoking the spirit of El Loco in their quest to avoid Championship footie next season. A simpler solution might have been to not get rid of him in such a hurry in the first place and spare us the skinny jeans, humiliating defeats and now the sight of Big Sam in the dugout/technical area effing and jeffing his way to another seven-figure payday regardless of the outcome. In a perfect world, Bielsa would have sacked the board. Now that would have been wild, but probably less chaotic” – Jeremy Boyce. What a bottle job, talk about choking the league. No, not Arsenal. I mean ‘us’. The ‘us’ in question being Sheffield Wednesday. We were top of League One, four points above second and with two games in hand, plus we had beaten Newcastle in the FA Cup. We subsequently collapsed like a soufflé taken out of the oven too early, finished third, went into the playoffs and then got hammered 4-0 in the first leg on Friday by a team that finished 19 points behind us.

    <head>Supermarket bosses face grilling on fuel prices from watchdog</head>
    <body>The competition watchdog is to question supermarket bosses after finding evidence that retailers have increased fuel prices to unnecessarily high levels, squeezing consumers who are hit by the cost of living crisis. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that high pump prices could not be solely blamed on global factors, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It added it had found evidence that weakening competition among the supermarkets had pushed up prices for drivers at the pump. The watchdog also said on Monday that it would step up its work in the grocery sector to check prices are not higher than they should be, given the pressures on households from soaring food inflation and the wider cost of living crisis. Related: UK forecourt owners accused of charging more for diesel than necessary The CMA said on Monday that, although “global factors” including the war in Ukraine had contributed to an increase in fuel prices, it was concerned retailers were taking larger margins than before the Covid pandemic hit. The CMA said average 2022 supermarket pump prices were about 5p a litre more expensive than they would have been had supermarkets maintained their average margins at 2019 levels. The watchdog said that although supermarkets still tended to be the cheapest retail suppliers of fuel, it had seen internal documents indicating that at least one unnamed supermarket had significantly increased its margin targets and claimed that rivals had spotted a change in behaviour and followed suit. Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “The rising cost of living is putting people and businesses under sustained financial pressure. The CMA is determined to do what it can to ensure competition helps contain these pressures as much as possible. “Although much of the pressure on pump prices is down to global factors including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have found evidence that suggests weakening retail competition is contributing to higher prices for drivers at the pumps. We are also concerned about the sustained higher margins on diesel compared with petrol we have seen this year. “We are not satisfied that all the supermarkets have been sufficiently forthcoming with the evidence they have provided in our road fuel market study, so we will be calling them in for formal interviews to get to the bottom of what is going on.” The CMA, which began studying the road fuel market in detail last year and has almost concluded its investigation, said it would conduct formal interviews with the supermarkets’ senior management “in order to get to the heart of the issues”. It will issue a final report no later than 7 July 2023. The CMA said it would also look at the grocery retail market and study whether any product categories merit closer examination. Cardell said: “Grocery and food shopping are essential purchases. We recognise that global factors are behind many of the grocery price increases, and we have seen no evidence at this stage of specific competition problems. “But, given ongoing concerns about high prices, we are stepping up our work in the grocery sector to help ensure competition is working well and people can exercise choice with confidence.”</body>

    <head>US TV shows are ending earlier than usual, and that’s a great thing</head>
    <body>It used to be so easy to tell the difference between a British TV show and an American one. The British show would have a maximum of 12 episodes, and the American one would have several hundred, and run for about a decade and a half. Related: Succession’s 20 greatest characters – ranked And this meant that they had to be viewed in a different way. These long American shows – think Grey’s Anatomy or NCIS or even 24 – had a habit of rattling on for so long that quality control became much less important than simply keeping the train on the rails. To think of a show like this is to think of a show that burst out of the gates with a ton of promise, then dwindled on to fewer plaudits and smaller audiences until the network did the decent thing and cancelled them. It is roughly the television equivalent of wanting to split up with someone but, rather than simply dumping them, just deciding to grow more neglectfully distant until they can’t take it and break up with you. However, a recent spate of shows demonstrate that this might no longer be the case. Two shows are ending this month on completely their terms. Bill Hader’s Barry has just two episodes left and, if this last season is any indication, promises to go out on an unapologetically bleak final note. And then there’s Succession. Judging by interviews with Jesse Armstrong, Succession is less building to an enraptured climax and more just stopping. Armstrong has admitted that the show could very happily keep churning out episodes for years like, say, Billions. And the ending is apparently so abrupt that Sarah Snook didn’t even have an inkling that things were coming to a close until Armstrong happened to mention it during the last ever table read. Obviously this is Succession, so it’s bound to have a satisfying and complex ending, but Armstrong’s decision to end things on his own terms is admirable. Would we be happier if Succession season five was already scheduled for November 2024? Possibly. But would our enjoyment of the show decrease with every new realisation that Armstrong was just content to shuffle the pieces around a chessboard until people stopped watching? Absolutely. Rachel Brosnahan in The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. Photograph: Philippe Antonello/AP Nor are these isolated incidents. The Marvelous Mrs Maisel is currently wrapping up too. And, although it’s one of those shows that feels like it has been around forever, no doubt in part due to its extended award season dominance, it is tapping out after just over 43 episodes. Again, the show has the bones of something that could very merrily chug along until the cast reach the point of decrepitude, so the decision to cut things off in their prime should be applauded. A couple of other soon-to-end shows are slightly different. Yellowstone is coming to an end, but this seems to be partly because Kevin Costner possesses the skittish nature of a classic movie star, and partly because by this point the Yellowstone Extended Universe stretches to about a million different – yet somehow entirely identical – shows, and the loss of one barely affects things at all. Similarly, Ted Lasso is coming to an end after just three seasons, but that primarily seems to be because it has made megastars of its entire cast (one’s going to be in Marvel films! One’s presenting Eurovision!) and a little sitcom about football can only contain so much star wattage. Obviously there are downsides to this trend for leaping from the car before it plummets off a cliff. The WGA strike is, in part, a protest against TV shows being given reduced episode orders, since they foster an atmosphere of insecurity for writers, many of whom have to retreat to back-up jobs between gigs because the current system doesn’t pay them enough. And you have to assume that this is in part a reaction to the cutthroat nature of the streaming model, which is prone to kick the feet out from underneath a show when it is determined that it no longer brings in a sufficient number of new subscribers. Think of Glow. Think of The Santa Clarita Diet. Think of all the other shows that have been booted into oblivion by executives without a shred of advance warning. Now, rather than face an indignity like that, wouldn’t you want to get in and out as quickly as you could? Of course you would. But despite this, the trend is good news for the viewer. In years to come, when we think about Barry or Succession, we’re going to think about muscular, brave shows that had the nous to barge in, tell the story they wanted and then leave again. No bad seasons. No listless wheel spinning. No crazy new characters being introduced after seven years to cover for the sudden loss of a cast member. Just good, succinct storytelling. So many shows could learn from Barry and Succession. Let’s hope it continues forever.</body>

    <head>Turkey election results 2023: what we know so far</head>
    <body>Tens of millions of Turkish voters went to the polls on Sunday to cast their vote in the presidential and parliamentary elections. Here is where the vote stands at the moment: President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his main rival, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, will go head-to-head in a runoff election after Erdoğan outperformed expectations but failed to reach the 50% threshold to win the presidential race outright. The president scored 49.51% against Kılıçdaroğlu’s 44.88%, with a small number of overseas votes left to count. The head of the supreme electoral board said even when the remaining 35,874 uncounted overseas votes were distributed, no one would secure the majority needed to win the elections outright. The runoff will take place on 28 May. A nationalist third candidate, Sinan Oğan, emerged as a potential kingmaker after picking up 5.17% of the vote. Official turnout reached a record 88.9%. “Don’t despair,” Kılıçdaroğlu told his supporters on Twitter. “We will stand up and take this election together.” Erdoğan’s rightwing party retained control of parliament through an alliance with ultra-nationalists. The lira touched new lows against the dollar and stocks on the Istanbul exchange fell on a realisation that the era of Erdoğan’s unconventional economics may not be over.</body>

    <head>Why is Imran Khan at the centre of a political crisis in Pakistan?</head>
    <body>The extraordinary arrest of the former prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan on charges of corruption on 9 May triggered nationwide protests and the deployment of the army on the streets. Thousands of people were detained and at least nine died in the violence. Since his release on 12 May, after his arrest was declared illegal, Khan has escalated his criticism of the country’s powerful military establishment, accusing them of ordering his imprisonment. The government said it would rearrest Khan as soon as it could, ensuring that Pakistan’s political volatility shows no signs of easing soon. How did the former cricketer get into politics? Khan entered politics in the mid-1990s as the leader of a newly formed political party, the Pakistan Movement for Justice, or the PTI. The young, popular former cricketer with anti-establishment politics quickly captured the country’s attention. He presented an alternative to the political establishment which was, perhaps ironically, riddled with allegations of corruption. “Both parties at the time were saddled with claims that they had become personal fiefdoms and that Pakistan had become entrenched in dynastic politics,” said Dr Farzana Shaikh, an associate fellow at Chatham House. As an anti-corruption figure, Khan also seemed to be an attractive choice for the military establishment. It took a number of years to get his party off the ground, but by 2018 Khan had enough support to win the election. It was not a landslide though – Khan still had to work with opposition parties as the leader of a coalition government but failed to build a consensus. As a result, the opposition would not cooperate and Khan quickly found his reform programme grinding to a halt. As the political situation in parliament deteriorated, “things were also going pear shaped with the military, the main reason being his decision to interfere in military appointments, which was a red line for them”, Shaikh said. This, in tandem with foreign policy choices that were hostile to the US, led to a political crisis that culminated in various groups coming together to oust Khan in 2022. What has happened since he left power? Related: Pakistan: army deployed across country as unrest triggered by Imran Khan arrest continues Since his ousting last year after a parliamentary vote of no-confidence, Khan has spearheaded a campaign against the new government over its economic mismanagement and its relationship with his former allies in Pakistan’s influential military. Khan has accused the army and the current prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, of being behind the assassination attempt he survived last November – an allegation vehemently denied. In turn, the government has levelled a host of corruption charges against Khan. After Khan was ejected from office last year, the new regime claimed that while in government he had struck a quid pro quid deal with a big property tycoon in Pakistan causing a loss of more than $239m (£190m) to the national exchequer. Khan denies these allegations, which are part of a mounting effort by the government and military to ensure he cannot run for office again. On 9 May, Khan was arrested by almost 100 paramilitary officers as he attended a bail hearing for a corruption case. His party, PTI, called it an “illegal abduction” and tens of thousands of Khan loyalists took to the streets in violent protest. Khan was held in custody until the police were forced to release him on 12 May, after the supreme court declared his arrest on court premises to be “illegal and invalid” and he was granted bail. Khan returned home to Lahore and has since alleged that the country’s powerful military establishment was behind his arrest. The government says it will rearrest Khan as soon as the law allows. An Imran Khan supporter throws a stone towards police officers after setting fire to a pile of tyres during clashes in Islamabad. Photograph: AP What is the background to his arrest? Khan has more than 100 cases registered against him, on everything from sedition and corruption, to terrorism and even blasphemy. Whatever the full truth of the latest charges, there is little doubt his arrest is a politically motivated attempt to ensure he does not run for office again. Shaikh says this kind of subterfuge is nothing new in Pakistan. “Cases being registered against politicians generally on charges of corruption is a game that all parties have played.” Khan himself has been accused of using this power against opposition leaders. How is Pakistan doing more generally? Pakistan is facing an economic crisis. Inflation has risen to 36.4%, meaning people cannot afford basic necessities including healthcare. Devastating floods last year submerged much of the country under water. Pakistan is on the edge of defaulting on its debt and is still waiting for a $1.1bn bailout from the IMF, which would have little impact on the $100bn total. Its usual backers, such as Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, have not come forward with the kind of assistance offered in the past. Counterintuitively, the dire economic situation has been Khan’s political saviour. “During Imran Khan’s tenure in office the economy was tanking slowly, and much of that has to do with the fact that he had alienated all the political parties to such an extent that no one would help him deliver on his economic programme,” said Shaikh. “So during his last year in office he saw his popularity plummet.” However, the failure of the government to resolve this crisis, which has become even more acute in the last year, has meant the blame has shifted to them. Shaikh said: “Khan is a very popular man at the moment, and if elections were to be held there is no doubt that he would come in with a huge majority.” Riot police take up position on the third day after the arrest of Imran Khan. Photograph: Bilawal Arbab/EPA What will happen next? This political and economic crisis threatens to tip Pakistan into a period of instability and unrest, although this is not inevitable. “Stability can be restored, but that depends very much on political parties sitting together and resuming dialogue,” Shaikh said. The future of Pakistan’s already fragile democracy is at stake. Khan is demanding that both provincial and general elections take place soon, and has threatened mass protests if the ruling government does not agree to dates. Members of the ruling coalition have also begun their own protest against the supreme court, accusing it of bias towards Khan. Many fear that if the turmoil continues, the army will try to step in and take control, as has happened repeatedly in the past.</body>

    <head>Turkey elections: runoff increasingly likely with Erdoğan ahead of Kılıçdaroğlu – as it happened</head>
    <body>11.08am BST We’re going to close this blog now. Here’s a brief summary of where things stand as we await official confirmation of the result: With nearly 99.5% of ballot boxes opened, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has received 49.4% of votes his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu 44.96%, Turkey’s elections council YSK has said. The near-complete results mean the election will almost certainly go to a runoff, scheduled for 28 May, since neither of the two leading candidates received more than 50% of the vote. Analysts have said it could be difficult for Kılıçdaroğlu to claw back Erdoğan’s five-point lead in the fortnight before the second round on 28 May, with the president likely to ride his stronger than forecast performance, surprise win in parliament and incumbency advantages to victory Speaking early on Monday, Erdoğan said he would accept a runoff, and accused unnamed others of trying to “deceive the nation” by claiming they were ahead. Kılıçdaroğlu said he too would accept a runoff, and would win it, saying: “Despite all of his lies and attacks, Erdoğan did not receive the desired outcome.” The third candidate in the race, ultranationalist Sinan Oğan, emerged as a potential kingmaker with just over 5% of the vote. Preliminary results from the parallel parliamentary elections showed Erdoğan’s governing coalition had secured 49.38% of the overall vote, while the opposition coalition has 35.16%, with potentially a further 10 percentage points if adding votes from the Kurdish-majority Peoples’ Democratic party or HDP (which ran under the Green Left party) and other socialist parties. The lira fell against the dollar and euro as investors voiced disappointment that Erdogan’s era of unconventional economics does not appear to be coming to an immediate end. Updated at 3.03pm BST 10.56am BST Here’s a a bit of a breakdown of some of the data from the presidential race. With more than 99% of ballot boxes opened, we know Recep Tayyip Erdoğan got 49.4% of the vote in the first round and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu got 44.95%. A run-off is all but guaranteed, and many analysts think Erdoğan will win. Kılıçdaroğlu outperformed Erdoğan in around 30 constituencies in the presidential election, primarily those in areas where the opposition candidate’s CHP party already enjoys significant popularity, such as the more liberal Aegean coast, the southern regions of the country, and Turkish Thrace in the far west. Notably, Kılıçdaroğlu garnered a substantial share of the vote in southeast Turkey, which comprises provinces with a predominantly Kurdish population and where the left-wing Yesil Sol party secured the majority of parliamentary seats. His message definitely resonated very strongly with Kurdish voters. Though the Kurdish vote was touted as the determining factor in this election – and the results do suggest it remains a crucial part of Kılıçdaroğlu’s electoral coalition – the opposition alliance will still need to gain more voters on the Turkish right to get Kılıçdaroğlu over 50% in a second round. Excluding the country’s three largest cities of Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara, however, Erdoğan appears to have got a consistently larger share than Kılıçdaroğlu throughout Anatolia in a total of 51 provinces, including the cities of Bursa and Konya (where he would have expected to win). Some of these victories have been decisive and Kahramanmaras province, which was badly hit by an earthquake earlier this year, is an indicator of that, delivering Erdoğan 70% in contrast to Kılıçdaroğlu’s 22%. Many of the leads Erdoğan gained in Anatolia appear to be quite sizeable victories, with Kılıçdaroğlu rarely getting over 30% of the vote in almost 19 of those constituencies. Here is a visual aid provided by Anadolu Agency. The red areas were won by Kılıçdaroğlu and the orange constituencies are Erdoğan’s: The graphic by AA shows how the chips fell in this election in Turkey. Photograph: Anadolu Agency 10.43am BST The Turkish lira is on a two-month low, its sovereign dollar bonds have tumbled and the cost of insuring exposure to the country’s debt has climbed sharply as investors digest a presidential election apparently headed for a runoff with the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the lead. Reuters reports that Turkish bank shares were also hit hard, with the country’s main banking index falling by more than 8%. The lira was at 19.65 to the dollar on Monday morning, its weakest since a record low of 19.80 in March. The Istanbul stock exchange was trading more than 2% lower, after an earlier 6.38% drop. Economists blame Erdogan for plunging the country into economic crisis, with inflation hitting 85% last year and the lira losing 80% of its value against the dollar in five years. “This is a major disappointment to investors hoping for a win for opposition candidate Kılıçdaroğlu and the reversion to orthodox economic policy he promised,” said Hasnain Malik, one analyst. 9.48am BST Here is Reuters’ latest take on where things stand: President Tayyip Erdoğan led comfortably in the first round of Turkey’s election on Monday, with his rival facing an uphill struggle to prevent him extending his rule into a third decade in a runoff vote on 28 May. Turkish assets weakened on the news, which showed Erdoğan just below the 50% threshold needed to avoid sending the Nato country to a second round of a presidential election viewed as passing judgment on his autocratic rule. Pro-government media cheered the outcome, with the Yeni Safak newspaper proclaiming “The people won”, referring to Erdoğan’s People’s Alliance, which appeared to have won a majority in parliament, potentially giving him a crucial edge in the presidential runoff. “The winner has undoubtedly been our country,” Erdogan said in a speech to cheering supporters at the headquarters of his ruling Islamist-rooted AK party in the capital, Ankara, overnight. Going into the election, the opposition had sensed its best chance yet of unseating Erdoğan, encouraged by polls showing him trailing his main challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. But the results suggested Erdoğan and his AK party had been able to rally conservative voters despite a cost-of-living crisis. Kılıçdaroğlu, the head of a six-party alliance, vowed to prevail in the runoff and accused Erdogan’s party of interfering with the counting and reporting of results, calling on his supporters in the country of 84 million to be patient. Updated at 9.51am BST 9.07am BST Iran’s foreign ministry has congratulated Turkey on the elections, saying the high turnout and successful organisation were the sign of a healthy democracy. “The high voter turn-out in Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday, and the successful holding of the votes, are a sign of victory for democracy in the neighboring and Muslim country,” foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Twitter. 🔽 Iran congratulates Turkey over presidential, parliamentary votes Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani has reacted to the high electoral participation rates in Turkey’s election, describing it as a victory for democracy. pic.twitter.com/NE6a3JZ998 — Iran Foreign Ministry 🇮🇷 (@IRIMFA_EN) May 15, 2023 Updated at 9.19am BST 8.45am BST Election council: Erdoğan has won 49.4% of votes With just over 99% of ballot boxes opened, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has received 49.4% of votes in the country’s presidential election, the head of the country’s election council has said. Reuters is quoting Ahmet Yener as saying on Monday that Erdoğan’s rival, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, had scored 44.96% and the third-placed candidate, ultranationalist and potential kingmaker Sinan Ogan 5.2% of the vote. The near-complete results strongly suggest the election will go to a runoff on 28 May since neither of the two leading candidates received more than 50% of the vote. Updated at 8.56am BST 8.38am BST In a look at the foreign policy implications of an eventual victory for the opposition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, concluded they might be more about style than substance: The distinctions being drawn between the foreign policy of the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, are less a substantial reinterpretation of the Turkish national interest, more about the style, tone and predictability in securing that interest. But tone matters in diplomacy, and the west would welcome an end to the era of confrontational rhetoric – even if the policy of balancing between east and west remains. You can read Patrick’s full piece here: Related: Turkish election may not bring the geopolitical shift some are hoping for 8.18am BST A reminder of what the two leading candidates said in their election addresses overnight: President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan: Even though the final results are not in, we are far ahead. We still don’t know the final official results, we are still waiting for the will of the nation to become apparent. The fact that the election results have not yet been finalised does not diminish the fact that our nation’s choice is clearly in favour of us. Erdoğan said he believed he would clear the 50% threshold necessary to avoid a runoff, but that if it came to a second round, “we would respect that too”. Opposition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu: Despite all of his lies and attacks, Erdoğan did not receive the desired outcome. No one should be enthusiastic about this being a done deal. We will definitely, definitely win this election in the second round. Everyone will see it. Preliminary results show Erdoğan did not receive the public confidence vote that he expected. The need for a change in society exceeds 50%. If the nation opts for a second round, it is more than welcome. 7.49am BST Hello, this is Jon Henley picking up the blog again from my colleague Graham Russell. As Turkey awaits the official results of a presidential election that looks almost certain to go to a second-round runoff, some international analysts believe Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has the wind in his sails. His chief rival, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, underperformed compared with polling expectations: on Friday, two polls projected the united opposition candidate would clear the 50% hurdle needed to avoid a runoff. Mujtaba Rahman, of Eurasia Group, says the election is Erdoğan’s to lose: 🇹🇷: All momentum now w Erdogan. Has taken Parliament, despite expectations to contrary. Has performed much better in 1st round of Presidential vote than polls predicted. Has incumbency advantages. For these &amp; many other reasons a @kilicdarogluk win on 28 May is now very unlikely — Mujtaba Rahman (@Mij_Europe) May 15, 2023 Updated at 7.55am BST 6.52am BST Summary It is nearly 9am on Monday in Ankara and tens of millions of Turkish voters are waking up to a day of political uncertainty after going to the polls the previous day to cast their vote in the presidential and parliamentary elections. Here is where the vote stands at the moment: A run-off election is looking increasingly likely between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his main rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu after neither appeared likely to reach the 50% threshold to win the presidential race outright. The state-owned Anadolu news agency has Erdoğan on 49.24% and Kılıçdaroğlu on 45.06% but there have been discrepancies between the data given out by state media and the Supreme Election Council (YSK), which is overseeing the election. Any second round of voting is likely to take place on 28 May. Speaking in the early hours of Monday, Erdoğan said he believed he had enough votes to win the first round outright but that he would accept a runoff, and accused unnamed others of trying to “deceive the nation” by claiming they were in the lead. Kılıçdaroğlu said he would accept a runoff, and would win it, saying: “Despite all of his lies and attacks, Erdoğan did not receive the desired outcome. No one should be enthusiastic about this being a done deal. The election is not won on the balcony,” he said, in an apparent reference to Erdoğan’s speech venue. The YSK said more than 91% of the vote has been counted, but that there have been long delays in tallying up votes from overseas. The YSK blamed a rise in the number of voters abroad and parties running this year. Kılıçdaroğlu and potential kingmaker Sinan Oğan – who has garnered about 5% of the vote – voiced concern about the pace of the vote count. Kılıçdaroğlu said some counts were being blocked by repeated objections. “Do not block the will of this nation. I call out to our democracy workers on the field. Never leave the ballot boxes and election boards. We are here until every single vote is counted,” he tweeted. Oğan said he had heard of overseas votes being “manipulated”. “Vote counting is not done in a healthy environment. I warn the YSK [the Supreme Election Council], take the necessary measures immediately and ensure that the vote counting processes are carried out quickly. In addition, we will not allow a fait accompli with a manipulation of foreign votes.” He did not provide evidence for his claims. In preliminary results from the parliamentary elections, state news agency Anadolu reported Erdoğan’s governing coalition had secured 49.38% of the overall vote, while the opposition coalition has 35.16%, with potentially a further 10 percentage points if adding votes from the Kurdish-majority Peoples’ Democratic party or HDP (which ran under the Green Left party) and other socialist parties. Anadolu said 96.39% of ballot boxes had been opened, which does not necessarily mean votes counted. The share of the parliamentary vote for Erdoğan’s AKP party has shrunk substantially from prior legislative elections, with the reported result the worst in at least 20 years, when the AKP came to power in 2002. The overall parliamentary result so far suggests a victory for a range of nationalist parties, but a surprise loss for the six-party opposition coalition headed by Kılıçdaroğlu, which had expected to clinch a majority. Kılıçdaroğlu had pledged to restore a parliamentary democracy system – rather than Erdoğan’s presidential one – if successful. The lira fell against the euro as investors voiced disappointment that Erdogan’s era of unconventional economics does not appear to be coming to an immediate end. Updated at 6.57am BST 6.45am BST In the early hours of Monday, presidential rivals Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu spoke to their supporters, and both backed the idea of a runoff vote if needed. 5.24am BST Turkey’s lira slipped to a fresh two-month low as the presidential election looked set to head to a runoff The currency weakened to 19.70 to the dollar before retracing some of its losses to 19.66, on track for its worst session since early November and not far off the 19.80 level it hit in early March following deadly earthquakes in February. The lira, which is prone to sharp swings before regular trading hours, has weakened 5% since the start of the year, Reuters reported. The currency has lost almost 95% of its value over the last decade-and-a-half as sugar-rush economic policies have led to spectacular boom and bust cycles, bouts of inflation and currency market turmoil. John Plassard, an investment specialist at Mirabaud Group, said Turkish markets should remain highly volatile, regardless of who wins the elections. The economic policies that have undermined the lira will continue if Erdoğan remains in power, he said. However, a change of government could put pressure on the currency before any new economic frameworks takes effect, he said. 5.12am BST So who is Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the opposition leader who is seeking to unseat Recep Tayyip Erdoğan? Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Barış Narlı took a look. He is a former civil servant and ex-accountant who leads a “humble life like yours”, he told a rally ahead of the election. Now he heads a six-party opposition coalition, and has worked to garner support from the marginalised Kurdish community, becoming the face of the opposition’s strongest chance to unseat Erdoğan in a generation, whose popularity has dipped amid rampant inflation and a deepening cost of living crisis. Other than promises of a socially democratic new dawn, the policies that Kılıçdaroğlu has been most vocal about include pledging to deport millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees living in Turkey. Asked how he intended to square this promise with a desire for Turkey to join the European Union, Kılıçdaroğlu claimed he could draw on the EU or even the United Nations for support. Should he become president, one of Kılıçdaroğlu’s largest challenges would be inheriting Erdoğan’s careful balancing act to maintain ties with both Moscow and Kyiv, and a camaraderie with the Russian president that few other leaders can claim. 4.36am BST Summary It is 6.30am in Ankara. Here is where the presidential and parliamentary elections stand at the moment. A run-off election is looking increasingly likely between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his main rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu after neither appeared likely to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. The state-owned Anadolu news agency has Erdoğan on 49.25% and Kılıçdaroğlu on 45.05% but there have been discrepancies between the data given out by state media and the Supreme Election Council (YSK). Any second round of voting is likely to take place on 28 May. Speaking in the early hours of Monday, Erdoğan said he believed he had enough votes to win outright but said he would accept a runoff, and accused unnamed others of trying to “deceive the nation” by claiming they were in the lead. Kılıçdaroğlu said he would accept a runoff, and would win it, saying: “Despite all of his lies and attacks, Erdoğan did not receive the desired outcome.

The lira fell against the euro as investors voiced disappointment that Erdogan’s era of unconventional economics does not appear to be coming to an immediate end. Updated at 5.42am BST 4.25am BST If the election does end with a runoff in two weeks’ time, Erdoğan may have an advantage, Howard Eissenstat, an associate professor of Middle East history and politics at St Lawrence University in New York, has suggested. Voters would not want a “divided government”, he said, referring to the parliamentary elections also being held the same day. Preliminary results reported by state news agency Anadolu said Erdoğan’s governing coalition had secured 49.38% of the overall vote, with the opposition coalition on 35.16%, with potentially another 10 percentage points if adding votes from the Kurdish-majority Peoples’ Democratic party or HDP (which ran under the Green Left party) and other socialist parties. However, the vote share for Erdoğan’s AKP party has shrunk substantially from prior legislative elections, with the preliminary result the worst in at least 20 years, when the AKP first came to power in 2022. 4.18am BST Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who leads a six-party coalition, had hoped to enact sweeping reforms, overhauling two decades of Erdoğan policies and returning Turkey to parliamentary democracy. Kılıçdaroğlu is a member of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority and said he intends to step back from Erdoğan’s heavy-handed control of public institutions and the media, promising a more inclusive Turkey and an end to the combative style of politics that Erdoğan is known for. The CHP leader has also promised to deport millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees who sought shelter in Turkey from conflicts at home. Sunday’s vote also represents a test of Kılıçdaroğlu’s promises of inclusion, in particular whether his outreach to Kurdish voters had been successful. Some Kurdish voters in Istanbul were overjoyed at the prospect that Erdoğan could be voted out, after years of attacks branding their party as an enemy of the state and the jailing of its leader, Selahattin Demirtaş, who has thrown his support behind Kılıçdaroğlu. 3.57am BST The outcome of the presidential election could soon have ramifications on the world stage, particularly in terms of the war in Ukraine. Erdoğan played a crucial role in the grain deal that allowed Kyiv to continue to export its harvests via the Black Sea. However, Erdoğan also objected to the accession to Nato of Sweden and Finland, later allowing Helsinki to join in return for a promised crackdown on groups seen by Ankara as terrorists, and to free up defence exports. Turkey has repeatedly said that Sweden needed to take additional steps against supporters of Kurdish militants and members of the network Ankara holds responsible for a 2016 coup attempt. Turkey treats both groups as terrorist organisations. 3.05am BST As we await a definitive result, our Middle East correspondent Bethan McKernan has taken a look at how President Erdoğan has reshaped Turkey in his image over the past 20 years, since becoming prime minister in 2003. “Four years ago, when ballots in local elections across Turkey were still being counted, municipality workers in Istanbul had already put up billboard posters of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his Justice and Development (AKP) party’s candidate for mayor in the cultural and commercial capital, thanking the city’s residents for their votes. “The hubris was short-lived. An opposition candidate won, and did even better in a controversial and high-stakes re-run – a moment that in retrospect many hoped would mark the beginning of the end of the political powerhouse’s long career.” Updated at 3.06am BST 2.47am BST Summary It is approaching 5am in Ankara. Here is where the presidential and parliamentary elections stand at the moment. A run-off election is looking increasingly likely between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his main rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu after neither appeared likely to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. The state-owned Anadolu news agency has Erdoğan on 49.25% and Kılıçdaroğlu on 45.05% but there have been discrepancies between the data given out by state media and the Supreme Election Council (YSK).

The lira fell against the euro as investors voiced disappointment that Erdogan’s era of unconventional economics does not appear to be coming to an immediate end. Updated at 2.52am BST 2.20am BST There have been delays to the counting of the votes lodged overseas. Ahmet Yener, the head of the Supreme Election Council (YSK), said earlier that 1,817, 010 votes had been cast overseas. Only 30.8% of overseas ballot boxes had been opened, he said, a significant lag on the 89% of domestic ballot boxes that had been opened at that point. (We’re now up to more than 91% counted, according to the YSK). Yeneer said the delays were down to a rise in the number of overseas voters, and in the number of parties running in the elections. There were eight parties in 2018, rising to 24 this time around. He said: “The process operating in 2018 is similar to the process operating in 2023. There is no problem in entering data from district election boards to our boards. Let the public rest easy.” 1.53am BST There has been a lot of speculation about who the third presidential candidate, Sinan Oğan, would throw his weight behind in the event of a second round runoff. Given the margins, his 5.25% would be a huge help to anyone who can gobble up the votes. A reporter with Der Spiegel, a German news site, suggested he’d given the first indication of what he’d like from the opposition Nation’s Alliance in exchange for his support. Oğan supposedly told Kılıçdaroğlu that he will only lend his support if the “HDP is excluded from the political system.” The party he is of course referring to is its successor party, Yeşil Sol.

Bunu nereden uydurdunuz? https://t.co/n4QcDHF7Ht — Dr. Sinan Oğan (@DrSinanOgan) May 15, 2023 Updated at 2.04am BST 1.48am BST Turkish presidential candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (second from left) appears at his CHP headquarters in Ankara, joined by the leaders of Nation Alliance. Photograph: Sedat Suna/EPA Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said he would accept, and win, a runoff vote. Photograph: Sedat Suna/EPA 1.32am BST A bit more from Ruth Michaelson on the parliamentary elections happening alongside the presidential side of things. Taking to the stage to claim victory in front of his supporters before all the votes had officially been counted, Erdoğan claimed his alliance had won a majority in the parliament. Turkey’s election authority, the YSK, said that with 91.93% of votes reported in the presidential election, Erdoğan had secured 49.49% of the vote, while Kılıçdaroğlu had 44.79%. However, the authority has not publicly commented on the parliamentary election results. Only Turkey’s state news agency Anadolu has reported parliamentary results, describing 96.39% of “ballot boxes opened”, which does not necessarily mean votes counted. The discrepancy between Anadolu’s percentage of the vote counted and the YSK’s throughout the evening has not been explained. Anadolu is currently reporting that Erdoğan’s governing coalition has secured 49.38% of the overall vote, while the opposition coalition has 35.16%, with potentially another 10 percentage points if they were to add on votes from the Kurdish-majority Peoples’ Democratic party or HDP (which ran under the Green Left party) and other socialist parties. The overall results in the parliamentary so far suggest a victory for a range of nationalist parties, but a surprise loss for the six-party opposition coalition (which includes one nationalist party), who had expected to clinch a majority. 1.26am BST Kılıçdaroğlu hit back at Erdoğan in what was a more subdued speech: “Despite all of his lies and attacks, Erdoğan did not receive the desired outcome. No one should be enthusiastic about this being a done deal. The election is not won on the balcony,” he said, referring to Erdoğan’s speech venue. He added: “We will definitely, definitely win this election in the second round. Everyone will see it. Preliminary results show that Erdoğan did not receive the public confidence vote that he expected. The need for a change in society exceeds 50%. The AKP’s loss of votes demonstrates this too. The process of entering [election] data is ongoing. If the nation opts for a second round, it is more than welcome.” 1.26am BST A few details about the likely kingmaker in a run-off, Sinan Oğan Sinan Oğan’s performance has caught a lot of people watching this election off guard. At the present count he has won well over 2 million votes, which is just over 5%. Muharrem İnce, the wildcard candidate who pulled out before the count will probably be smacking himself as Oğan gets ready to negotiate with the competing major camps if this goes to a second round. Oğan, 56, is leading a right-wing nationalist coalition called the Ancestral Alliance (ATA) which is composed of four parties (Zafer party, Adalet party, Ulkem party, and Türkiye İttifakı party). He is of ethnic Azeri origin and hails from the eastern Igdir province (where he got only 11% of the vote). Oğan studied a PhD in Moscow and is a fluent Russian speaker. He also previously stood on the ticket of MHP – AKP’s coalition partner - representing the party in parliament in 2011 back when the party was strongly opposed to Erdoğan who was then prime minister. He was twice expelled from the MHP but remained with it after a court ruled in his favour. After a series of splits within the right-wing movement, which doesn’t appear to have diluted how much of the vote these parties capture, he eventually went his own way. He was among a band of political firebrands, including Meral Aksener, who leads the Iyi party, who split with MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli, when he began working with Erdoğan to change Turkey’s political system. On the policy side Oğan is thin but he has pushed anti-Syrian refugee messages to increase his popularity and is staunchly anti-PKK, a Kurdish armed group the Turkish government has been fighting since the 1980s considered a terrorist organisation in Ankara and across the EU. It isn’t clear just yet whether he has taken votes from Kılıçdaroğlu or Erdoğan’s alliance, but his small share of the vote will likely be enough to tip the scale in favour of whichever candidate he leans towards if there is a second round. Given how tight this election has been he’ll probably demand a political pound of flesh in exchange for his support though it would be difficult to imagine a hardline Turkish nationalist entering an alliance which has the support of the pro-Kurdish Yesil Sol party, which is often accused by Turkish nationalists of being too close to the PKK. When asked by reporters which way he would go in a second round run-off he said: “We will look at their national stances and competence. We will look at the situation of affiliation with terrorism and seeking help from terrorism.” Der Spiegel earlier reported that he would work with Kılıçdaroğlu if the HDP was “excluded”, but Oğan rejected that in a tweet. In any case, that would be tricky for Kılıçdaroğlu whose electoral strategy relies on Kurdish voters being onboard. Kurdish populated regions in southeast Turkey voted overwhelmingly in his favour in this election and that strategy served is party well in 2019 to get Ekrem İmamoğlu in power in Istanbul. It isn’t clear that gaining Oğan would make up for loosing a large chunk of the Kurdish vote. Updated at 2.26am BST 1.11am BST I will accept a run-off vote, says challenger Kılıçdaroğlu Erdoğan’s main rival, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, has spoken, giving a competing version of how the vote is going. He has said that he will accept a run-off vote, referring to it as the people’s decision, and said he would win it. Erdoğan had not obtained the result he wanted, he said. Both the main rivals have now said they would accept a run-off vote if that is what was decided, though Erdoğan has said he believes he has the votes to win outright. 1.05am BST The results also reveal interesting trends in major Turkish cities. Turkey’s largest city, Istanbul, has swung towards Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu but only just. The AKP has the most MPs from the city’s three regions which complicates the ‘he who rules Istanbul, rules Turkey maxim’ which has been reliable bellwether of how the country is leaning. Turkey’s second-largest city, Ankara, also went for the opposition candidate and its third largest Izmir did too. Bursa, the country’s fourth largest city, and Konya, a traditional conservative strong-hold and the fifth largest were kept by the AKP-led People’s Alliance. As with prior elections the AKP has been much stronger across Anatolia, than the CHP-led alliance Nation’s Alliance but the results do show that Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu managed to successful connect with the Kurdish populated south-east. According to Anadolu, in Tunceli he got 80% of the vote, 75% in the border region of Sirnak and 71% in Diyarbakir. 12.59am BST More than 91% of vote counted, election council says The head of Turkey’s election authority has said that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is leading Sunday’s presidential elections with 49.49%, with 91.93% of ballot boxes counted. Ahmet Yener said Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, Erdogan’s main rival, had 44.49% of votes. 12.39am BST The general trend in this election on the parliamentary level has been towards a diffusion of votes towards smaller and in some cases newer parties and away from Turkey’s larger parties like the CHP, but even more so away from the governing AKP. As it stands with over 95% of ballots opened according to state agency Anadolu, the AKP-led People’s Alliance has almost half of the parliament and constitutes a large majority but its share of the vote has shrunk substantially from prior legislative elections. Here is some data taking us back to when the AKP first came to power in 2002: 2002 - 34.4% 2007 - 46.5% 2011 - 49.3% 2015 - 49.5% 2018 - 42.6% 2023 - 35.4% This won’t surprise regular observers of Turkish politics. Soaring inflation has eaten away at the purchasing power of regular Turks, and as inflation has increased, the AKP’s popularity has declined also. That was clearest when another broad opposition alliance led by the CHP which Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was the patient architect of took Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara in 2019 local elections. Updated at 12.45am BST 12.36am BST Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, accompanied by his wife Ermine Erdoğan, greets supporters at the AK party headquarters in Ankara in the early hours of Monday. Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/Reuters 12.26am BST Outright win is possible, Erdoğan says Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has just given a jubilant and energetic speech to his followers gathered outside his Justice and Development party (AKP) headquarters in the capital, Ankara, where he strode out onto the stage singing one of his campaign songs, entitled “For those who hear, and for those who don’t hear.” The speech appears to be an attempt to seize control of the narrative in a tightly contested vote where the opposition say many of their votes have yet to be included in the official tally. Turkey’s official elections authority the YSK said that 87.13% of the vote had been counted. “We love you very much,” he told the crowd, appearing fired up in a way that has rarely been quite so apparent on the campaign trail. Erdoğan initially promised a more subdued election campaign following twin deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people, but recently switched to staging regular rallies. “Somebody is in the kitchen, we are on the balcony,” said Erdoğan, in a reference to his rival presidential candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu’s campaign videos filmed in his kitchen intended to portray his rival as down-to-earth. He added: “Our country has completely a feast of democracy with these elections. Although the results are not clear yet we are in the lead by a long way. Both domestic and overseas voting results will take time to come in, but of course we are not like those who try to deceive the nation perhaps for the last time by creating a picture where they are far behind but saying they were ahead. We have always been honest to our nation, we know that we are far ahead in the election today, however we expect that the exact results will come.” “We believe we can get above 50% in this round,” he said, indicating he now believes that an outright win might still be possible rather than a run-off in two weeks’ time. Updated at 12.26am BST 12.18am BST It is after 2am in Istanbul and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is now speaking on the balcony at his party’s headquarters. We’ll bring you the details soon. 12.01am BST Summary A run-off election is looking increasingly likely between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s ruling AKP party and his opposition rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu’s CHP. Based on results so far, neither party appears likely to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. Any second round run-off would take place on 28 May. The Supreme Election Council (YSK) says 87% of the vote has been counted, but that there have been long delays in tallying up those that are being counted abroad. The state-owned Anadolu news agency has Erdoğan on 49.38% and Kılıçdaroğlu on 44.90% but there have been discrepancies between the data given out by state media and the YSK. Opposition figures Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu and Sinan Oğan have voiced concern about the pace of the vote count. Kılıçdaroğlu said some counts were being blocked by repeated objections. “Do not block the will of this nation. I call out to our democracy workers on the field. Never leave the ballot boxes and election boards. We are here until every single vote is counted,” he tweeted. Oğan said he had heard of overseas votes being “manipulated”. “Vote counting is not done in a healthy environment. I warn the YSK [the Supreme Election Council]. Take the necessary measures immediately and ensure that the vote counting processes are carried out quickly. In addition, we will not allow a fait accompli with a manipulation of foreign votes.” The lira has fallen against the euro as investors voiced disappointment that Erdogan’s era of unconventional economics does not appear to be coming to an immediate end. 11.45pm BST Sinan Oğan, who leads a right-wing nationalist coalition called the Ancestral Alliance (ATA) that is currently on about 5% of the vote – and a potential crucial part of negotiations in the event of a run-off – has voiced concerns about the overseas votes. “We have heard that some manipulations were carried out in the overseas vote counting processes,” he has tweeted. “Vote counting is not done in a healthy environment. I warn the YSK [the Supreme Election Council]. Take the necessary measures immediately and ensure that the vote counting processes are carried out quickly. In addition, we will not allow a fait accompli with a manipulation of foreign votes.” 11.41pm BST 87% of vote counted, says election council A spokesman for the Supreme Election Council in Turkey has just said 87.13% of votes have been counted, with long delays in tallying up those that are being counted abroad. 11.28pm BST Here are some of those scenes in Istanbul Supporters of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his AK party (AKP) in Istanbul, Turkey.

The nation is waiting for its leader,” with a video of jubilant scenes of crowds outside their headquarters the capital Ankara. Here in Istanbul, there was a brief burst of what looked like celebratory fireworks just over the Bosphorus – although there is little to suggest from what we know of the count that Erdoğan’s side has reasons to claim outright victory in the presidential election. The parliamentary results are also hanging in the balance, with the state news agency reporting that the AKP’s coalition could be on course to winning a majority, although it is unclear how many of the votes have been entered into the system of the supreme election council (YSK).

The currency also weakened against the dollar, with the lira on track for its worst session since early November. 11.06pm BST Kılıçdaroğlu cotinued: “Do not block the will of this nation. I call out to our democracy workers on the field. Never leave the ballot boxes and election boards. We are here until every single vote is counted.” He says there have been repeated objections at 300 ballot boxes in Ankara and 783 in Istanbul. 10.53pm BST Opposition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said president Erdoğan’s camp is blocking the system by objecting to results from certain ballot boxes, Al Jazeera reports. “There are ballot boxes that have been objected to six times, 11 times,” Kılıçdaroğlu said, according to Al Jazeera. “You are blocking the will of Turkey.” He added: “You cannot prevent what will happen through objections. We will not allow a fait accompli.” Kılıçdaroğlu also urged Erdogan to stop “perception management” and requested the national election board act responsibly. Updated at 10.57pm BST 10.34pm BST The mayor of Ankara, a senior member of Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu’s opposition CHP party, has said he expects his candidate to finish ahead of President Erdoğan. “There is a short time left to get all the results,” Mansur Yavas told a joint press conference in Istanbul with the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem İmamoğlu. “When we see them, we will see our leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu finishing this round as the front-runner.” But Yavas said there was now “a high possibility” that the race would go to a second round. The electoral council, meanwhile, which will announce the final result, has said a total of 69% of votes – cast both at home and abroad – have been entered into its system. 10.12pm BST President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who is registered to vote in Istanbul, has made a surprise appearance there, mingling with supporters, before getting into his car and heading to the capital, Ankara to await the official results. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan greets crowds on a surprise election night appearance in Istanbul Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Updated at 10.21pm BST 10.09pm BST As we wait for the last few million votes in the presidential election to be counted, we shouldn’t forget today’s other poll: the election for Turkey’s 600-seat parliament. At present over 80% of ballot boxes have been opened and Erdoğan’s People’s Alliance (a coalition of right-leaning and right-wing parties, including his AKP’s coalition partner MHP) appear on track to become the largest block. No surprises there. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu’s opposition Nation Alliance, led by his CHP (with the right-wing Iyi Party) is the second largest, and appears to have bagged around a third of the votes (35.6% of the total, according the state news agency Anadolu). Erdoğan’s former economy tsar, Ali Babacan, and former foreign policy guru, Ahmet Davutoglu, are both running on the CHP ticket (despite having established their own parties in the run up to the election) and don’t appear to have significantly impacted the Nation Alliance’s share of the vote. But the CHP did well on along Turkey’s Mediterranean coast, in Thrace and in the major cities of Izmir, Istanbul and the capital Ankara. The results also indicate a strong showing for nationalist parties. MHP was real the surprise performer tonight. At the present count, the MHP and its splinter party, Iyi, have about 20% of the vote between them, though they represent opposing camps in this race. The Yesil Sol party, a successor to the HDP, has swept up the country’s south-eastern region with strong showings in Diyarbakir, Hakkari and Sirnak (over 60%). Most of this region also voted strongly in favour of opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Most people will have their eyes on the results from the presidential elections, which increasingly look like they’ll go to a second round. But the Turkish parliament remains an important institution and will have a major role in the coming government, either as a spoiler for a president who doesn’t control it, or a boon for a president whose political allies are represented in it. Despite the powerful executive presidency Erdoğan introduced in 2018, the parliament has the power to declare war, ratify treaties, pass budgets, amend the constitution and scrutinise the activities of the government. Updated at 10.19pm BST 9.34pm BST Members, officials and supporters of both candidates’ parties are waiting for confirmation of the results in a presidential race that now looks likely to head to a second-round runoff in two weeks’ time. Members of the centre-left opposition CHP party wait for results at their hedquarters in Istanbul Photograph: Yasin Akgül/AFP/Getty Images Supporters of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wait for results outside his AKP party’s HQ in Istanbul Photograph: Ozan Köse/AFP/Getty Images 9.17pm BST It could be some time before we get an official result. Ahmet Yener, the head of Turkey’s supreme election council, – which will announce the final figures – has said it has entered just over 47% of domestic votes and 12.6% of votes cast abroad into its system. In short statement outside the council’s headquarters, Yener also rejected opposition allegations that it was deliberately delaying publishing some results. 9.08pm BST Agencies: Erdoğan vote falls below 50% The gap between the two leading candidates continues to narrow as more big-city votes – generally favouring opposition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu – come in, but Turkish news agencies are still reporting different numbers. They agree on one thing, however: a runoff now looks increasingly likely. The state news agency, Anadolu, is reporting that more than 90% of votes have been counted. It has President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on 49.8% – crucially, below the 50% needed to avoid a runoff – and Kılıçdaroğlu on 44.4%. The privately owned Anka agency is reporting that 94% of votes have so far been counted. It has Erdoğan on 49.02% and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu on 45.2%. In either case, as things are at the moment, the presidential election is heading for a second round on 28 May. Updated at 9.26pm BST 8.48pm BST President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has tweeted to criticise opposition attempts to declare the result ahead of time, and – as his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu did earlier – to ask party and election officials to remain vigilant with ballot boxes. 14 Mayıs seçimlerinin uhulet ve suhulet ile büyük bir demokrasi şöleni şeklinde gerçekleşmesi, Türkiye’mizin sahip olduğu demokratik olgunluğun ifadesidir.… — Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (@RTErdogan) May 14, 2023 “While the election was held in such a positive and democratic atmosphere and the vote counting is still going on, trying to announce results hastily amounts to a usurpation of the national will,” he said. “I ask all of officials and my colleagues to stay at the ballot boxes, no matter what, until the results are officially finalised. I congratulate all citizens who voted in the name of democracy and are taking part in the election work.” 8.42pm BST Ultranationalist Sinan Oğan, currently credited with about 5% of the vote and a potential kingmaker in the event of a runoff, has said he thinks the election will probably go to a second round on 28 May. “We see a high probability that the elections will go to the second round” since neither main candidate is on course to win 50% of the vote, he said, adding that “Turkish nationalists and Kemalists are key to this election”. 8.24pm BST Opposition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has posted another tweet suggesting that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s vote share, which began the evening at 60%, has now fallen to below 50%. He urged election officials to stay alert and not abandon their posts during the rest of the evening. Yüzde 60&apos;lar ile başlayan kurgu şu anda 50&apos;nin altına düştü. Sandık müşahitleri ve seçim kurullarındaki görevlilerimiz bulundukları yerden asla ayrılmasın. Bu gece uyumayacağız Halkım. YSK&apos;yı uyarıyorum, illerdeki veri girişini sağlamak zorundasınız. — Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (@kilicdarogluk) May 14, 2023 “The fiction, which started with 60%, has now dropped below 50%,” Kılıçdaroğlu said. “Ballot observers and election board officials should never leave their places. We will not sleep tonight, my people. I warn the YSK [election commission], you have to provide data from the provinces.” Updated at 8.32pm BST 8.07pm BST We have just arrived at the Istanbul headquarters of the largest opposition party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), after a journey across Istanbul where the streets were remarkably quiet. Earlier today, people were outside enjoying a day of spring weather and cheerfully walking to the polls no matter who their chosen candidate was, but as the results started to come in, the streets fell silent – it felt like basically everyone was at home glued to their television sets. If they did venture out, they were frantically following on their phones. The mood at the CHP is predictably tense – everyone here is quietly glued to any screen showing the results. As the vote count nears 80% of votes counted – at least, according to the state news agency Anadolu (which has been the source of plenty of controversy so far this evening) – the race is looking increasingly close and we’re starting to see two parallel narratives emerge. According to the opposition, they are ahead. According to Erdoğan and the spokesperson of his Justice and Development (AKP) party as well as the state news agency, the opposition is falling behind. The opposition claim this is due to the order in which the ballots have been counted, and that the government has slow-walked counting in opposition-majority areas. As the results started to trickle in a couple of hours ago, leading opposition MPs held multiple press conferences to drive home the message that they are winning, at least according to their data. Now we are seeing Erdoğan and the AKP pushing back, although we are likely to hear more from the CHP as this long night continues. Ali İhsan Yavuz, an AKP MP in charge of election coordination, just told reporters outside their headquarters in Ankara that “there is no panic and there is no need to blame the institutions”. He added: “We are ahead in both the parliamentary and the presidential results.” Updated at 8.11pm BST 7.52pm BST Reuters: both camps say runoff looking likely Reuters is reporting sources in both President Erdoğan’s ruling AKP party and his opposition rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu’s CHP as saying that based on results so far, neither is likely to clear the 50% threshold needed for an outright win. With 75% of votes counted, the state-owned Anadolu news agency has Erdoğan on 50.76% and Kılıçdaroğlu on 43.43%. The private Anka agency also has Erdoğan ahead, but by a much narrower margin: roughly 48% to 47%. The steady performance of the third candidate, nationalist Sinan Oğan, unchanged at just over 5.3%, makes a second round – scheduled for a fortnight’s time on 28 May – more likely, several analysts have said. Updated at 8.24pm BST 7.40pm BST Ankara’s mayor, Mansur Yavaş, from Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu’s centre-left CHP party, has said that based on data from party workers monitoring the count, the retired civil servant is ahead. Turkish news agencies are reporting that President Erdoğan has a lead of between two and eight percentage points with about two-thirds of votes counted. Yavaş insisted Kılıçdaroğlu was still in a position to win the election outright on Sunday night by securing more than 50% of the vote. Turkey’s supreme election council is expected to announce the official result later. Updated at 7.44pm BST 6.55pm BST Ömer Çelik, a spokesperson for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s ruling AKP party, has accused opposition leaders of “an attempt to assassinate the national will” by claiming the Anadolu state news agency is distorting the results (see 18.03 BST). “Even before the results are finalised, all of a sudden the opposition alliance’s spokesperson and mayors appear on TV. As usual, they began to say that Anadolu Agency is manipulating data,” Çelik said. Updated at 7.33pm BST 6.41pm BST More than 50% of votes counted More than half the votes have now been counted in Turkey’s presidential election and the gap between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his chief rival, opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, continues to narrow. According to the Anadolu state news agency, which the opposition has accused of deliberately releasing results to show the outgoing president ahead, the count with nearly 53% of votes tallied stands at: Erdoğan : 51.8% Kılıçdaroğlu : 42.3% Oğan: 5.3% The privately owned Anka news agency, however, has Kılıçdaroğlu already ahead with slighty less of the vote tallied. His CHP party has said their candidate is leading according to its data, and is on course to clear the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff and be declared president on Sunday night. Updated at 7.33pm BST 6.26pm BST Supporters of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his ruling AKP party have gathered to cheer outside its Istanbul headquarters as early results show the incumbent president ahead. Analysts have said the gap between Erdoğan and his rival, united opposition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, should continue to narrow as the evening wears on. Supporters of outgoing Turkish president Erdoğan cheer outside his AKP party headquarters as early results come through Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/Reuters Supporters of outgoing Turkist president Erdoğan cheer outside the headquarters of AKP party in Istanbul Photograph: Francisco Seco/AP Updated at 6.41pm BST 6.03pm BST Opposition vice-presidential candidates Mansur Yavaş and Ekrem İmamoğlu have just given a press conference in the Turkish capital, Ankara, lashing out at the state news agency Anadolu for what they said was broadcasting distorted results. The opposition accuse Anadolu of broadcasting counted AKP votes first in a warped picture of the overall result, and say they are in the lead. The largest opposition party, the Republican People’s party (CHP) is running a parallel count by stationing their own observers at every ballot box and photographing every ballot as it is counted. “According to our results, with 23.87% of the votes counted, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu is ahead,” said Yavaş, who is also Ankara mayor, adding: “This data comes from all over Turkey and I can say that we are ahead in Istanbul and Ankara.” İmamoğlu, whose election as mayor of Istanbul in 2019 was a close race that was ultimately disputed by Erdoğan and re-run before he was declared the winner a second time, also directed his anger at Anadolu. “Unfortunately, we are still experiencing the scene we see in every election. Another case of Anadolu Agency [...] AA’s reputation is below zero,” he said. Presidential candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu simply tweeted: “We are ahead.” Öndeyiz. — Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (@kilicdarogluk) May 14, 2023 Updated at 6.12pm BST 5.57pm BST Erdoğan&apos;s lead narrows with one-third of votes counted With more than a third (38.3%) of votes counted, according to the Anadolu state news agency (AA), the gap between the two leading candidates is shrinking. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan now stands on 52.7%, his centre-left opposition rival Kamel Kılıçdaroğlu on 41.4%, and the nationalist Oğan on 5.4%. Updated at 7.33pm BST 5.51pm BST The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) has said early results are looking positive for Kılıçdaroğlu. Faik Öztrak, the party’s spokesperson, said in a televised speech: According to the data we received so far, we see the table very positively. When the number of ballot boxes opened reaches a meaningful figure, we will start to share the number of votes. Updated at 7.34pm BST 5.48pm BST The Guardian’s video team were on the ground in Turkey last week and produced a fascinating film about the importance of the Kurdish vote in these elections. Kurdish voters, many of them anti-Erdoğan, account for about 10-15% of the country’s electorate and their ballots could prove crucial. You can watch the film here: Updated at 5.49pm BST 5.37pm BST Underlining how important the big cities are to Kılıçdaroğlu’s vote share, Ruth Michaelson writes, the head of his CHP party in Istanbul and leading opposition figure Canan Kaftancıoğlu has just released a partial opposition parallel count in Istanbul. The move seems designed to calm anxious opposition voters as the count continues. İstanbul’da saat: 19.17 itibariyle sandıkların %15 sisteme girdi ve %15 veriye göre: Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu: % 51.33 R. Tayyip Erdoğan : % 43.94 Sinan Oğan : % 4.45 Muharrem İnce : % 0.28#SanaSöz 🫶 — Canan Kaftancıoğlu (@Canan_Kaftanci) May 14, 2023 With 15% of the ballot boxes entered into the system in Istanbul, the vote stares stand at: Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu: 51.33% R. Tayyip Erdogan: 43.94% Sinan Oğan : 4.45% Muharrem İnce : % 0.28 The vote in Istanbul is key as it is Turkey’s largest city, with more than 15 million residents out of 85 million in total. At least 64 million people were expected to cast their ballots across the country on Sunday. Updated at 5.56pm BST 5.24pm BST The Guardian’s Ruth Michaelson in Istanbul has this to say on the vote tally: Voters across Turkey are now glued to their television screens, watching results come in for what many are calling the most important election of the year. In some cases, people have travelled across the country to go back to their villages destroyed by powerful twin earthquakes earlier this year in order to cast their ballots, and turnout is expected to be unusually high. People everywhere reported unusually long wait times and long lines to vote. With the broadcast ban on the vote count now lifted, we’re now seeing results trickle in live, in an extremely tense vote that is expected to be close. Erdoğan has almost total control of the domestic media, which is affecting how we learn the latest results. Referring to the Anadolu Agency, a representative from the majority Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) to the electoral commission said: “There is a great media manipulation. AA gets all the information from the government’s partners.” Ziya Meral of the Royal United Services Institute in London said: “With all of its faults, yes it’s not a fair election, it’s decently free but not fully, given the overall conditions. But you can still select the candidate you want freely, so it’s substantially free from that perspective. Even for Erdoğan this vote matters so much, which goes to show this is a fundamental political battle for him.” 5.19pm BST Key event Just over 23% of votes have now been counted, according to state news agency Anadolu’s vote tracker. (Note that these are not official results. In past elections, Anadolu has been accused of favouring Erdoğan and his AKP party.) Vote shares stand at 54.6% for Erdoğan and 39.4% for Kılıçdaroğlu, with Oğan on 5.5%. Again, many of Kılıçdaroğlu’s votes are not expected to be reported until much later in the evening, while results from small rural polling stations that are mostly pro- Erdoğan tend to get counted first. Updated at 7.35pm BST 5.01pm BST As expected, Erdoğan leads in early results With just under 10% of votes counted, Turkey’s state Anadolu Agency reports that the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, holds an early lead with 59.5%. His arch-rival for the presidency, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, is on 34.8%, while the third candidate, nationalist Sinan Oğan, has just over 5% of votes counted so far. Analysts have said that Kılıçdaroğlu, who has relatively high levels of support in some of Turkey’s biggest cities, is likely to trail in early results but should pull back as more results come in. Updated at 7.36pm BST 4.52pm BST Opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has asked election officials on Twitter not to leave the ballot boxes until the last vote was delivered. Demokrasi kahramanlarımıza seslenmek istiyorum. İmzalı son sandık tutanağı teslim edilene kadar, ne olursa olsun asla sandıkların başından ayrılmayın. Millet iradesinin tam ve doğru biçimde tecelli etmesi sizin kararlılığınıza bağlı. Göreceksiniz, yorgunluğunuza değecek. 🫶🏼 — Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (@kilicdarogluk) May 14, 2023 “I want to call out to our heroes of democracy. Never leave the ballot boxes, no matter what, until the last signed ballot box report is delivered,” he said. “The full and correct manifestation of the will of the people depends on your determination. You will see, it will be worth your tiredness.” 4.46pm BST Results reporting ban lifted; early lead for Erdoğan expected As of 6.30pm local time, Turkey’s supreme election board has lifted its ban on the reporting of election results – originally in place until 9pm. Results should now start trickling in, more than two hours before they were initially expected. The picture is is likely to remain unclear for some hours yet, however. That’s essentially because results from Erdoğan’s rural and conservative heartland tend to be declared early, while Kılıçdaroğlu’s strong urban support comes through later. Analysts have said they expect an initial lead for Erdoğan that should be clawed back by Kılıçdaroğlu in the course of the evening. Updated at 6.08pm BST 4.42pm BST The election campaign has been dominated by the state of Turkey’s economy and the country’s cost of living crisis, as well as the massive damage caused by February’s earthquakes. Even before the earthquakes Turkey’s economy was in trouble: economists say Erdoğan’s unorthodox insistence on keeping interest rates low has sent inflation soaring – to 85% last year – while the Turkish lira has lost about 80% of its value against the dollar in the past five five years. Soaring food prices and rents have been among voters’ biggest concerns throughout the campaign. Interest rates are usually hiked to cool inflation, but Erdoğan has denounced them as “the mother and father of all evil”. The opposition has also successfully attacked alleged government mismanagement of the rescue operation after the earhquakes, which killed more than 50,000 people and displaced millions more. The slow pace of reconstruction, as well as accusations of a failure to enforce building codes owing to widespread corruption, are also believed to have hit Erdoğan’s suport, particularly in the hard-hit, traditionally pro-AKP east and south-east of the country. Updated at 7.36pm BST 4.30pm BST Deniz Barış Narlı in Istanbul writes in with some news on turnout, which could prove crucial to the election’s outcome: Election turnout is expected to be high in this pivotal election. Turkey has a fairly high turnout rate generally: it was around 86% in the previous presidential elections in 2018. “We are expecting a record turnout in Istanbul, and there are also reports that this is the same across Turkey,” said Canan Kaftancıoğlu, the Istanbul chair of Kılıçdaroğlu’s CHP party. Istanbul is Turkey’s biggest city and turnout here may be decisive for the election results as the race is expected to go down to the wire. “Except for one or two individual cases, I would say that our citizens completed the voting process without any trouble or problem,” Kaftancıoğlu said. She also invited voters to go to polling stations to observe the vote-counting process, regardless of the party they voted for. Voting was also being monitored by a mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is due to deliver a preliminary statement on its findings on Monday. Updated at 4.32pm BST 4.20pm BST The news portal Haberler has posted an amusing video clip of two voters waiting patiently to cast their ballots in Istanbul who suddenly realise their president is standing in the queue right behind them: Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan&apos;ı arkasında gören seçmen şaşırdı. pic.twitter.com/QymY2oEax9 — Haberler.com (@Haberler) May 14, 2023 Updated at 6.15pm BST 4.15pm BST Reuters has pulled together the views of a range of Turkish voters from around the country as they cast their votes on Sunday: In Istanbul, Hasibe, 40, a school employee: Erdoğan gave us everything. He made many lovely things happen. I don’t know what else he can give us but I want him to continue. We’ve been worn about by the excitement all week. I don’t think it will go to a runoff. Ahmet Kalkan, retired health worker, 64: I see these elections as a choice between democracy and dictatorship. I chose democracy and I hope that my country chooses democracy. I have hope that Kılıçdaroğlu will win. Kubra, 36, telecommunications sector worker: I have voted many times but I feel so excited for the first time. I voted for Kılıçdaroğlu and the Nation Alliance. I want development and change in education, law, democracy and human rights. Gungor Yucel, 80: My ideas have changed since the last election. We feel insulted now. We are tired of the constant sayings and empty words. Of course, there are good things Erdoğan did, but lately, they started to look down on and insult the nation. In the southern city of Antakya, devastated by February’s earthquake, Ozgur Kayabolen: We don’t like this government, especially this president. When the earthquake happened, they leave here the people for dead, nobody come here for four days. In Diyarbakir, in the mainly Kurdish southeast, Nuri Can, 26: I voted for the Green Left Party and Kılıçdaroğlu because the economic crisis is making it difficult for us. A change is needed for the country. After the election there will be an economic crisis at the door again, so I wanted change. Hayati Arslan, 51: I voted for the AK Party and Erdoğan. The country’s economic situation is not good but I still believe that Erdoğan will fix this situation. Turkey’s prestige abroad has reached a very good point with Erdoğan and I want this to continue. 3.47pm BST The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has tweeted to his supporters after polling stations closed: Değerli dava ve yol arkadaşlarım... Oy verme işlemi ülkemiz genelinde, hamdolsun, demokrasimize yakışır bir şekilde tamamlandı. Şimdi, her zaman olduğu gibi sandıklara sıkı sıkıya sahip çıkma vakti. Sonuçlar kesinleşinceye kadar milletimizin iradesini korumaya devam!.. — Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (@RTErdogan) May 14, 2023 “The voting process has been completed throughout the country in a way that befits our democracy,” the outgoing president said. “Now, as always, it is time to firmly protect the ballot boxes. Until results are finalised, we continue to protect the will of our nation.” Updated at 4.32pm BST 3.37pm BST Emre Peker, an analyst at EurasiaGroup, has an interesting thread on Twitter here on what the election is ultimately about and how it could play out: Ultimately, this is an election battle between continuity and change, with the economy the biggest driver. Erdogan is desperately trying to move the debate to issues such as terrorism/national security and family values, while trying to project a strong-world-leader image. But given the scale of economic problems, he is not having much luck—therefore resorting to handouts to woo voters.Kilicdaroglu is doubling down on sound economic management, democracy, justice, rule of law, and freedoms. His coalition is performing well on the campaign, outshining Erdogan with painting a pretty picture for the future, compared to Erdogan’s reliance on past accomplishments. Peker suggests neither Erdoğan nor Kılıçdaroğlu may be able to decisively push past the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff — but he reckons a surprise win is within reach all the same. “The vote will be a knife-edge,” he said. Updated at 4.34pm BST 3.27pm BST Today’s election matters far beyond the borders of Turkey. Under Erdoğan, the country has flexed is military muscle in the Middle East and beyond, launching incursions into Syria, waging an offensive against Kurdish militants inside Iraq and sending military support to Libya and Azerbaijan. It has also clashed diplomatically with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Israel, rowed with Greece and Cyprus over maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, and been subjected to US arms industry sanctions after buying Russian air defences. Erdoğan’s closeness to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has led critics to question Turkey’s commitment to its fellow Nato members, which Ankara’s recent reluctance to endorse Sweden and Finland’s membership applications has only reinforced. Turkey also, however, brokered a deal for Ukrainian wheat exports – underlining its potential role in ending the war. For the EU, defeat for Erdoğan would be strategically welcome but politically tricky, since it might relaunch Turkey’s accession bid. 3.23pm BST Here are some agency photographs of today’s voting in Turkey Turkey’s president for the past 20 years, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, casts his vote in Istanbul Photograph: Dia Images/Getty Images Opposition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu casts his ballot at a high school in Ankara Photograph: Alp Eren Kaya/Depo Photos/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock Election workers start the count after polling closes in Ankara Photograph: Çağla Gürdoğan/Reuters Voters in Istanbul line up to cast their ballots earlier in the day Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images Updated at 3.25pm BST 3.04pm BST Polls close It is now 5pm in Turkey and voting has ended in both the country’s parliamentary and presidential elections. Under Turkish law, reporting of any results is banned until 9pm local time. By later this evening we should have a good indication of whether either presidential candidate has cleared the 50% bar necessary to avoid a runoff in a fortnight’s time. Updated at 3.05pm BST 3.01pm BST Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, 74, has headed the main opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) since 2010 and was named the six-party opposition alliance’s presidential candidate in March. Long stuck in Erdoğan’s shadow, the bookish former civil servant, from a historically repressed Kurdish group, has lost half a dozen national elections to Erdoğan while leading his secular party. He entered parliament in 2002 with the CHP, which was established by modern Turkey’s founder Ataturk, and – although he has led the CHP to major victories in big-city municipalities including Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir – has struggled to reach beyond its secularist grassroots to attract conservative voters. The candidate of the Nation Alliance or Table of Six has been criticised as lacking charisma, and for blocking politicians from his own party – such as high-profile mayors – who may have stood a better chance of victory. During this campaign, however, Kılıçdaroğlu has struck a more inclusive note, seeking to draw in voters disillusioned by Erdoğan’s rhetoric and perceived economic mismanagement. He has promised economic prosperity, and greater respect for human rights and the rule of law. His frank kitchen chats with voters have belatedly turned him into something of a social media star. He has also promised to retire after stripping the presidency of Erdoğan’s powers and then “go and spend more time with my grandchildren”. Kılıçdaroğlu’s promise to “bring spring … and serenity to this land” has attracted younger voters as well as a broad cross-section of Turks exhausted by the outgoing president’s culture wars and harsh, polarising rhetoric. He has also pledged to release many of the popular figures jailed by Erdoğan’s government in the wake of a failed but bloody 2016 coup attempt as part of his objective of ending what he has called the president’s “one-man regime”. Updated at 3.08pm BST 2.44pm BST The country’s most powerful leader since Atatürk, who founded modern Turkey a century ago, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a devout 69-year-old, has steered Turkey steadily away from secularism, glorifying its Islamic past - and embracing chaos on the way. He rose to power 20 years ago as prime minister while Turkey was emerging from a period of rampant inflation, promising sound government, and became president in 2014. At the height of his success, Turkey enjoyed a protracted economic boom. But economists blame Erdoğan for the country’s current economic crisis, saying his insistence on low interest rates has sent inflation soaring – to 85% last year – and caused the Turkish lira to lose 80% of its value against the dollar in five years. Erdoğan has logged more than a dozen election victories and survived an attempted coup in 2016, shaping the country to his vision of a pious, conservative society and assertive regional player. In 2018 he abolished its parliamentary system, centralising power in an executive presidency. From his 1,000-room palace outside Ankara, Erdoğan in effect dictates government policy and, critics say, has eroded democracy, stifling dissent and bringing media and judges under his sway. His supporters argue he has saved the country from serious security threats. Abroad, Turkey under Erdoğan has flexed its military muscle in the Middle East and beyond, launching offensives in Syria and squabbling incessantly with Greece. His interventions in Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh swung the outcomes of complex great-power conflicts. His courtship of Russia has upset Washington, and his sale of weapons to Ukraine has irritated the Kremlin. But he has always seemed to know how to play one off the other so as to appear like the consummate statesman to his domestic audience. Updated at 3.40pm BST 2.22pm BST Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Barış Narlı are in Istanbul for the Guardian. Ruth has just sent this early dispatch on the atmosphere as Turks went to the polls: The mood at some of the polling stations in Istanbul was sharply divided, with AKP voters stating they were determined to re-elect Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and rebuffing concerns about the economy or the risk he could lose. Many mentioned a need for the country to remain united despite the deep political polarisation that has overtaken Turkey throughout the past decade and fears that Erdoğan or his Justice and Development party (AKP) could demand people take to the streets if they lose, or if the vote is close. “We will do what justice and fairness require,” said 51-year-old Veysel Isinal, asked if he would take to the streets if the AKP demanded it. “I believe the president will win re-election – if he doesn’t that would be bad for the country.” Younger voters, however, were determined to vote for anyone other than Erdoğan or the AKP. A group in their mid-20s standing in the middle of Erdoğan’s home district in Istanbul, where he campaigned just yesterday, said gen Z would be the generation to end his 20-year reign. Kurdish voters, courted by the opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, were jubilant about the prospect of ending Erdoğan’s reign. “This time he’s going,” one said, laughing happily with several friends who had turned out to vote. Updated at 3.12pm BST 2.16pm BST The basics: who is standing, and how do the votes work Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his Justice and Development party (AKP) face their greatest political challenge yet. Amid an economic crisis, and months after earthquakes killed more than 50,000 people and displaced millions more, today’s elections – presidential and parliamentary – will decide who leads the country where it heads next. Erdoğan has championed religious and conservative social values at home, while asserting Turkey’s influence in the region and loosening its ties with the west. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the secularist Republican People’s party (CHP), is standing for the six-party Nation Alliance. He has pledged to prioritise justice, corruption and education. In the presidential election, any candidate who wins more than 50% of votes in the first round is elected president. If no one secures a majority, the election goes to a runoff – due on 28 May – between the two leading candidates. In the parliamentary elections, the number of seats a party wins in the 600-member parliament is directly proportional to the number of votes it receives, providing it gets – alone or as part of an alliance – at least 7% of the national vote. Updated at 2.17pm BST 1.58pm BST The year&apos;s most important election? Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of what many of the world’s media and pundits have had no hesitation in describing as the most significant election of 2023. It’s easy to see why: Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, leader for the past 20 years of a country of global economic and strategic importance, could be on the way out. Polls increasingly show Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the unity candidate for six opposition parties, with a narrow lead over Erdoğan – possibly scoring above the 50% needed to win outright. Over two decades, an increasingly authoritarian Erdoğan has taken control of many of Turkey’s institutions – including much of the media and judiciary – steadily sidelining his opponents. Kılıçdaroğlu aims to reverse many of those policies, including Erdoğan’s all-powerful executive presidency, return power to parliament, slash inflation and improve relations with the west. The stakes are high: Turkey, a country of 85 million people at the crossroads between Asia, Europe and the Middle East, could continue its democratic slide, or reverse the damage. We’ll be bringing you all the latest news as it happens: polls close an hour from now, at 5pm local time (2pm GMT), and we could have an early indication of the result by 9pm local time.</body>

    <head>Carlos Alcaraz stunned by world No 135 Fabian Marozsan in Italian Open</head>
    <body>The qualifier Fabian Marozsan produced the biggest shock of the ATP season so far with a stunning 6-3, 7-6 (4) victory against the second seed Carlos Alcaraz in the third round of the Italian Open on Monday afternoon. Marozsan, a 23-year-old Hungarian ranked No 135, is the lowest‑ranked player to defeat Alcaraz since July 2021. Until he came through the qualifying draw in Rome and defeated the No 67 Corentin Moutet, Marozsan had never won an ATP match. Related: Andrey Rublev: ‘I lost them matches because of myself. I couldn’t handle the pressure’ He had additionally arrived in Rome in poor form. Although Marozsan won an ATP Challenger event on clay in March, he started this tournament having lost five of his previous six matches. Alcaraz, meanwhile, had a 30-2 record in 2022 after tournament wins in Barcelona and Madrid and the 20-year-old will return to No 1 in the ATP rankings next week. Despite his disappointment, Alcaraz absorbed the defeat with a typical smile, heaping praise on his opponent’s performance after the match. Asked if he felt any physical issues, Alcaraz shrugged off the question: “No, no, no. I was perfect physically,” he said. “I just didn’t feel comfortable. He made me feel uncomfortable on court. He was aggressive all the time. He was playing inside the baseline all the time. It was tough for me to get into the match, into the rally.” The defeat may prove a blessing in disguise for Alcaraz, who will have a chance to rest instead of toiling through a second two-week Masters 1000 event ahead of the French Open, where he will be seeded No 1 at a grand slam for the first time. For Marozsan, his victory moves him up to around 114 in the ATP rankings, meaning he is very close to directly entering his first grand slam main draw. “The goal for me was winning one match in the qualies. Now I just won five matches,” he said. “I’m very, very happy,” Marozsan said. “I can’t imagine this one. It was my dream last night.” On his first appearance on any major stadium court, Marozsan approached the most hyped and in‑form player on the tour without fear or favour. From the very beginning of the match, Marozsan served precisely and controlled the baseline. He forced Alcaraz back with consistent aggression and his sweet two-handed backhand while offering the Spaniard a taste of his own medicine: a constant stream of winning drop shots. As Marozsan commanded the opening set, Alcaraz struggled to find his range. He continued to spray unforced errors, eventually falling down a set and a break. But Alcaraz fought hard, retrieving the break at 3-4 by landing returns and finding greater consistency, and he eventually forced a tie-break. Just as it seemed that Alcaraz had steadied himself, establishing a 4-1 lead in the tie-break, Marozsan exploded. He won the final six points of the match with an array of absurd winners from difficult defensive positions. Marozsan attacked until the end, forcing a final forehand error from Alcaraz as he completed the victory of his life. “I just tried to do something special, win a few games and maybe a set,” he said. “I just beat the world No 1, he’s the best in our sport, so I’m really happy with this.” Meanwhile, Daniil Medvedev continued to find his feet on clay as he moved into the fourth round with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-3 victory against Bernabé Zapata Miralles of Spain. Medvedev has reached at least the round of 16 of all three clay court Masters 1000 events this year and his progress has been clear. “This year, I feel different, I feel like I can play on clay,” he said. “I can play well. I can put my opponents in trouble. It’s just, well, don’t miss, don’t double fault and that’s how you can win matches.”</body>

    <head>The biggest ever space explosion has occurred – what do you mean you don’t care?</head>
    <body>Something pretty huge happened in space recently. Well, that’s not strictly true – to be more accurate, something truly gargantuan happened in space approximately 8 billion years ago, that we are only just finding out about now. Last Friday, scientists revealed the largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed: like a supernova, but more than 10 times brighter and more powerful than any other seen before. And its cause? A giant cloud of gas being sucked into a supermassive black hole. If you want people to be excited about something, it’s important to come up with a catchy name. So, taking a leaf out of Elon Musk’s book of baby names, scientists called it AT2021lwx. But I’m gonna call her Sue. Sue Pernova. (You’re welcome.) Sue had humble beginnings. She started out like the damp patch in the corner of your bathroom – small and barely noticeable, then over the course of time growing into something monstrous and without precedent. It was only when scientists established just how distant Sue was (8 billion lightyears) that they realised quite how much energy she must be burning to produce a light so bright. This is all well and good, I hear you cry, but why should I care? Sue seems great, but she lives miles away and besides I’m far too busy having to do the weekly shop, picking up the kids from school and Googling “black mould removal”. Well, I’ve been a space superfan since I was old enough to say “Houston we have a problem”, so you don’t have to convince me to care. But space can give us an insight into our existence. There are certain aspects of space exploration that are easy to defend. Like the Dart mission last year which successfully tested technology designed to shift an asteroid off its course, protecting Earth and its inhabitants from a fatal collision. Most of us have a vested interest in the Earth not being smashed to smithereens, so it’s great to know that Nasa is on the case. Related: Astronomers capture largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed Some of the other stuff, though, is far more abstract and, for want of a better word, nerdy. But the truth is, every time something like this happens it puts another piece in the puzzle of understanding where we came from and where we will go. We all know some basic things about the universe and our solar system from our school days: Jupiter has its raging stormy eye, Saturn has its rings, and Pluto has an identity crisis about its latest reclassification. But what you perhaps didn’t know, because they only found out recently, is that Saturn didn’t always have its rings. A study from the University of Colorado suggests that the rings are only 400 million years old, with Saturn being nearer 4.5 billion years in age. Those figures are quite hard to get your head around, but if you scale that timeline down, it’s the equivalent of an 85-year-old bloke called Stanley deciding to grow a mo-hawk at 81. That’s a pretty wild and late-stage development, right? Certainly not something to define his whole existence by. In the even blinkier-blink of an eye that is the period of human existence, we happen to have magically coincided with this beautiful phenomenon. Us being here now at the same time of Saturn’s rings is a delightful coincidence: a reminder that everything is fleeting, everything is changing, even in the universe. Someone sent me a meme recently with a picture of the galaxy and an arrow pointing to a barely visible dot labelled “You, crying in the shower”. Apart from being very funny, it’s also very true (the crying bit, certainly). I find the underlying message of it weirdly profound. We are all so very small and the universe is so very big and almost all of our hopes, dreams and fears are entirely trivial. If that doesn’t sound particularly comforting, stick with me. In 2009, Nasa released captures from the Hubble telescope showing the deepest image of the universe ever taken to date, allowing you to scroll in and out of hundreds of galaxies and solar systems that seemingly go on for ever. If you ever need a moment of profound perspective, that does it. Cosmically speaking, if we are all insignificant, then everything we do is almost in defiance of that. It renders the choices we make simultaneously meaningless and also the most wonderful act of living; one more beautiful addition to an already improbable existence. That’s a pretty liberating thought. It’s all connected. Like it or not, we’re all part of a kind of celestial foxtrot: expanding, contracting, dying and being reborn. So next time you hear about something happening a million miles away, think about how you’re a small part of that and how incredible it is to exist. Why not look out of your window tonight – maybe you’ll see the light from some supernova long since gone. And who knows, perhaps someone 8 billion lightyears away will be looking back from their damp, damp, bathroom, seeing the dead light from our sun and wondering about their own place in the universe.

    <head>Doyle Brunson, the ‘Godfather of Poker’, dies at age of 89</head>
    <body>Doyle Brunson, one of the most influential poker players of all time and twice world champion, died on Sunday at the age of 89. Brian Balsbaugh, Brunson’s agent, posted a statement on Twitter from the family. “It is with a heavy heart we announce the passing of our father, Doyle Brunson,” the statement read. “He was a beloved Christian man, husband, father and grandfather. We’ll have more to say over the coming days as we honor his legacy. Please keep Doyle and our family in your prayers. May he rest in peace.” Related: Doyle Brunson Brunson started playing seriously in Fort Worth, Texas, where he said the game was far tougher than the glossy, televised tournaments that are prevalent today. “It was like the old west. Violence was rampant,” he told the Guardian in 2005, adding he had seen two people shot during games. “It was kind of a hangout for the hoodlums and gangsters of Texas and it was very, very volatile.” Brunson, called the Godfather of Poker and also known as “Texas Dolly,” won 10 World Series of Poker tournaments – second only to Phil Hellmuth’s 16. He also captured world championships in 1976 and 1977 and was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1988. He won more than $6m in live earnings during his career. He wrote Super System in 1979, one of the first books to delve into poker strategy. It created a lasting impact that professional and casual players used to improve their performances. “The two most important things are a good sense of recall and a good understanding of people,” Brunson said when asked about the secret to success in poker. “You have to have a sixth sense, a kind of gut feeling that tells you what the other guy’s holding. That’s probably the thing that all the greats share.” Tributes poured in from other poker players after Brunson’s death was announced. Five-time WSOP winner Scotty Nguyen tweeted that he “can’t believe this day has come – you will always be held high in our hearts, the man, the myth, the legend &amp; THE GODFATHER of poker baby! Mr Brunson, you made poker what it is baby! thank you for what you give to all of us baby! RIP Mr Doyle Brunson THE GODFATHER OF POKER.” Brunson continued to play at a high-level well into his 80s and said poker helped him feel young. “We don’t stop playing because we get old, we get old because we stop playing,” Brunson said on a number of occasions. Rest in Peace to the Biggest Legend of Them All. Thank you for being the consummate player and gentleman. No one will ever fill your seat. pic.twitter.com/riE35PCrQh — WSOP - World Series of Poker (@WSOP) May 15, 2023 Brunson is survived by his wife, Louise, and children Todd and Pamela. Todd followed in his father’s footsteps, becoming a professional poker player and is also a member of the Poker Hall of Fame. “The plan was for [Todd] to be a lawyer,” Brunson told the Guardian in 2005. “He was in this third year of college and I didn’t even know he played poker. Then he came home one summer and declared he was going to turn professional. His mother was very angry about it. And I pretended to be.”</body>

    <head>‘I used to do tarot readings but it got too scary’: Sting on making Shape of My Heart</head>
    <body>Sting, singer, songwriter The guitarist Dominic Miller and I would get together at my house in Wiltshire every Wednesday. One week, Dom came in with four chords. I said, “I like the sound of that” – and eventually we had the shape of a song. I took it out into the garden on headphones and just walked around thinking, “What is the story this music is trying to tell?” The chords weren’t sexy – they were contemplative. So I was thinking of somebody who uses their brain. I came up with the idea of a card-player who is also a philosopher. As a kid, I had played five-card stud. Years later, someone taught me tarot and I would do readings for people and see all this dark stuff I was apprehensive about telling them. In the end, it got so scary I gave it up, but I remained fascinated by tarot cards and their relationship with regular playing cards – the diamonds are pentacles and the spades are swords. So for the song, I liked the imagery of a kind of soldier whose weapons are his cards. The hook – “But that’s not the shape of my heart” – reflects the fact that a playing card heart doesn’t look like a human one. ‘We didn’t dress it up too much’ … Sting. Photograph: Eric Ryan Anderson By that point, I had spent a lot of time in airless studios and I just wanted to come home. So I built a studio in the kitchen. The atmosphere on the record came from that environment – we were all very happy, and the house was reverberating with music. In the video, I’m walking the dog. I asked the legendary harmonica player Larry Adler if he’d play on it. The guy had recorded Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue and had a piece – Romance for Harmonica – written for him by Vaughan Williams. It was such an honour that he agreed. David Sancious played keyboards and Vinnie Colaiuta drums. We didn’t dress it up too much. It’s been sampled many times by rap artists: I think the descending chords inspire a contemplative kind of rap. When I hear Craig David or Juice WRLD’s versions, I think they’ve interpreted the song in the same way. In my set now, we do Shape of My Heart and Juice WRLD’s version as a mashup. There’s even a magician called Shawn Farquhar who plays the song as he shuffles cards. Every time a certain card is mentioned in the lyrics, it miraculously appears at the top of the deck. I’ve watched his video several times. I’m fascinated by all the places where the song turns up. Dominic Miller, guitarist, songwriter When I auditioned for Sting in 1989, I couldn’t get any sound out of my guitar. Technicians were running around, changing amps, switching power supplies. I stood there thinking: “This is really going to shit.” Then, after they’d exhausted every possibility, Sting casually walked over and turned the volume up on my instrument. The crew were in hysterics – but thinking I’d already lost the gig helped me relax. We’ve played together ever since. The Shape of My Heart riff wasn’t something I intended to present to him. I was just playing around with some Chopin-esque descending piano chords as an exercise, but they were really nice. So, instead of naffly trying to make it sound classical, I came up with a series of notes for the right hand with a John Lennon type of rhythm. It’s been sampled many, many times – and there are something like 150 covers I was sitting by Sting’s fireplace in Lake House playing it. Only the dog was listening, but then Sting said, “What’s that, mate?” I told him it was just my silly little riff and he said, “That should be a song.” We put a simple beat together on a drum machine and he went out to the garden and came back with a lyric, but I didn’t really hear the words at that point. I drove home and didn’t think more about it. We had 30-40 ideas for songs. Then later he called and said: “That thing we were working on today sounds really good.” It was the fifth single from the album Ten Summoner’s Tales, but people started taking more notice of it after Luc Besson used it in the film Léon. Since then, it’s been sampled many, many times – and there are something like 150 covers. The 90bpm tempo and descending chord sequence seem to connect with a certain type of producer. It amuses me that people like Juice WRLD, Nas, Craig David and the Sugababes are actually playing Chopin without realising it. • On 18 May, Sting will become an Ivors Academy Fellow, the highest honour the Academy bestows.

    <head>Sunday Mirror ‘did dodgy stuff’ on every story, phone-hacking trial told</head>
    <body>The Sunday Mirror’s editor personally taught journalists how to hack voicemails, a former reporter has told the high court. Dan Evans told the phone-hacking trial that illegal activity was “bog-standard” at the tabloid newspaper. “The paper did dodgy stuff on basically every story and that is how we operated,” he said. Andrew Green KC, the Mirror’s barrister, suggested that Evans’s recollection of events might be affected by the reporter’s heavy consumption of alcohol and drugs while working on the Sunday Mirror. Evans replied: “That would be common to pretty much everyone else who worked on those newspapers.” Evans was giving evidence in support of Prince Harry and other alleged phone-hacking victims, who are suing Mirror Group Newspapers. They claim illegal behaviour was widespread at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People and was approved by top executives including Piers Morgan. Morgan has denied all wrongdoing. The reporter said he was the victim of “corporate grooming” in the dark arts of journalism, after joining the Sunday Mirror as a junior reporter in the early 2000s. Evans said he was taught to systemically hack celebrities’ voicemails by the Sunday Mirror’s then boss, Tina Weaver, and the news editor Nick Buckley, with the knowledge of the newspaper’s lawyers. The journalist says he was made the Sunday Mirror’s dedicated phone hacker in 2003 after the previous occupant of the role left to join another newspaper. Evans then acted under the “tutelage and instruction” of Weaver and Buckley to build a phone-hacking database, with other journalists at the Sunday Mirror feeding him celebrities’ personal mobile phone and landline numbers to be hacked. These numbers were stored on a PalmPilot, enabling Evans to systematically access the celebrities’ voicemails in the hope of finding stories about their personal lives. The court has already heard allegations that Weaver, a former showbusiness correspondent, was personally involved in illegally accessing voicemails during the 2000s. She was arrested on suspicion of phone hacking along with other senior Mirror staff in 2013 but the case was dropped two years later, after the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was “insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction”. Phone hacking involved calling an individual’s phone number and attempting to guess the pin code that provided remote access to voicemails. Most people did not change the default four-digit code, making it easy for journalists to listen in on what was in their inboxes. Evans, who went on to work for the News of the World, later admitted hacking phones and carrying out other illegal acts. He was given a suspended sentence after giving evidence against Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson at their phone-hacking trials in 2014. The reporter told the court that the Sunday Mirror regularly used private investigators to illegally “blag” private records by phoning up organisations and persuading people to hand over personal details. Weaver allegedly ordered Evans to stop using one private investigator “not because it was illegal” but because she feared the individual would leak confidential tips and stories to a rival newspaper. Evans denied his evidence to the phone-hacking trial was driven by a desire to pursue a personal vendetta and said he was tired by his involvement in phone hacking. “It has been a bane on my life,” he said. “It’s been extremely stressful. I’ve committed to seeing through an important process.” He said illegal behaviour was “deeply entrenched” at the company. Mirror Group Newspapers, which has already paid out more than £100m to settle phone-hacking claims, is disputing much of the evidence in this trial and argues that the claimants have waited too long to bring their cases. The case continues.</body>

    <head>Chelsea’s new monsters, bench depth and other Women’s FA Cup final lessons</head>
    <body>Hybrid monsters After Chelsea had navigated their way past Bayern Munich in 2021 to earn a place in their first Champions League final, Emma Hayes labelled her gutsy side “mentality monsters”. They then lost the final against Barcelona by a humbling 4-0 scoreline. But the “mentality monsters” moniker stuck and has been reaffirmed in three consecutive FA Cup wins and back‑to-back Women’s Super League titles, with a third in sight. After beating Manchester United 1-0 to win the FA Cup at Wembley on Sunday, Hayes had a new label for her side. “What the team has become is the most flexible team,” she said. “Our team has become ‘hybrid monsters’. We can float between things in ways that takes years to master. They are so adaptable.” Winning in transition There are always incomings and outgoings, but football teams exist in cycles, with the core peaking and then being pulled apart as the side is reshaped for the next phase. Chelsea are in transition. The team have had to cope for much of the season without the forwards Fran Kirby and Pernille Harder and the summer signing Kadeisha Buchanan forced the captain, Magda Eriksson, out of the side in the early stages of the season. But it is ongoing, with Harder and Eriksson out of contract at the end of the season and courting offers and Kirby’s injury and illness record meaning Chelsea always need a plan B. Despite the turmoil, they are still winning and that is what makes these victories more impressive. After their triumph on Sunday, Hayes spoke of her aim during periods of change. “Our team has been in transition,” she said. “We had six different players in the starting lineup to last year’s final. That, for me, is a sign of real progress. My big thing is: ‘How can we keep winning while transitioning?’ To win knowing we’re in that stage, this is far and away my most memorable FA Cup final.” Emma Hayes lifts the FA Cup after her team’s victory at Wembley. Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images Depth and bench “Manchester United had the first half but we had the second half,” Hayes said. United could rue missed chances and not capitalising on their first‑half dominance but it was in the second that the game turned. The change was easy to pinpoint. In the 57th minute, Harder and the midfielder Sophie Ingle replaced Jessie Fleming and Melanie Leupolz and the momentum shifted decisively in Chelsea’s favour. When United’s brightest threat, Nikita Parris, exited a few minutes later, with the forward Rachel Williams coming on, the Reds faded. The later introductions of the forwards Lucia García and Martha Thomas underwhelmed. That is the difference between the sides. Chelsea don’t just have incredible high‑quality depth in their squad, they have players on the bench with many minutes under their belts. “All the time in training, we don’t play starting groups, we believe in different combinations, different relationships and everyone that knows me knows I don’t put together a team of 11 players – it’s about a squad,” Hayes had said before the final. That is the level United need to reach. The starting XI is strong, but Marc Skinner’s lack of rotation this term has frustrated a layer of the fanbase. It is costly not only because those players don’t get a rest but also because the transition of players in and out of the XI is not smooth. Convincing Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle, whose contracts are up this summer, to stay will be vital for United alongside strengthening the squad. But will players be enticed to the club if playing time is limited? Not even Champions League football will be enough to lure players if they won’t play. Is this the Kerr World Cup? There is no doubting Sam Kerr’s phenomenal talent and drive. Her 10th goal in seven domestic cup finals is testament to the Australian’s potency. Kerr has been the figurehead of Chelsea’s more bruising charge towards the double this season, a role she has shared in recent years with Harder and Kirby. The return of Harder, who has four goals and an assist in two league games since her comeback from injury and set up Kerr for the winning goal in the final, speaks to how much has been put on Kerr’s shoulders. She has looked knackered but Harder’s availability is allowing her much‑needed rest. The World Cup starts in July and Kerr is the tournament’s poster woman. Australia have had their share of injuries this year, with Arsenal’s Caitlin Foord and Steph Catley, San Diego Wave’s Emily van Egmond, Melbourne Victory’s Elise Kellond‑Knight, Tottenham’s Kyah Simon and Aston Villa’s Emily Gielnik among those who missed their most recent training camp. Some will return, some won’t, but what has been clear this season is that if Kerr is there anything can happen no matter who is around her or what the odds are.</body>

    <head>George Osborne to lead £2.4bn investment management firm</head>
    <body>George Osborne has been hired to lead a new $3bn (£2.4bn) investment management firm, adding to a growing roster of lucrative jobs the former UK chancellor has taken up since stepping down as an MP in 2017. Osborne, who led the Treasury under David Cameron from 2010 to 2016, has been appointed chair of Lingotto Investment Management, which is owned by the billionaire Agnelli family’s Exor group. Exor manages the Italian family’s investments in an array of companies, including Juventus FC, the Economist and Ferrari, and is run by the Agnelli heir, John Elkann. Related: Ban smoking and tax fruit juice, says George Osborne Lingotto markets itself as “an independent, entrepreneurial” firm that will allow staff to pursue their “passion for investing without the bureaucracy of most large organisations, or the loneliness of standalone funds”. It adds to a growing list of City roles held by Osborne, who is already a partner at the boutique City advisory firm Robey Warshaw. That role, which he took up in early 2021, has already proved lucrative, with the former politician having been one of four partners who shared a £26.5m payout last year. He will also remain a director for his family’s wallpaper-making business, Osborne &amp; Little, which is controlled by his father, Sir Peter Osborne. The company disclosed last year that it had increased pay for directors, including the former chancellor, by 30% after a jump in profits that were helped by £700,000 in British and US government grants. The ex-parliamentarian will also maintain his roles as chair of the British Museum and managing partner of the venture capital firm 9yards Capital, which he founded with his younger brother, Theo. The firm has made a number of investments in startups including the US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase – which recently reached a settlement with US authorities after an investigation into compliance and money-laundering controls – and Robinhood, the trading platform that gained notoriety for allowing amateur stock investors to play the market. Osborne had an even more wide-ranging portfolio career before he agreed to give up many of those positions when joining Robey Warshaw two years ago. He said goodbye to a big annual paycheque from BlackRock, which paid him £650,000 for working one day a week as an adviser. Previous posts he had held also included his editorship of the Evening Standard – which he led between 2016 and 2019 – and his chairmanship of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. The new role at Lingotto is new but not unexpected, with Osborne already having served as the chair of Exor’s business advisory council for the past five years. Lingotto – which is not disclosing Osborne’s salary – said the former chancellor would drop the council role to run the investment management firm, but would “use his extensive professional experience in support of the company’s development”. “I’m delighted to be joining the team here, which offers something new and unique in the investment management space,” Osborne said. “It’s been a privilege to chair the Exor partners’ council since 2018 and I now look forward to working with the Lingotto team, helping them to build a great company.” Lingotto has also hired former Baillie Gifford partner James Anderson to its investor team. It brings Anderson back into the industry a year after he stepped down from Baillie Gifford, where he was an early backer in firms including Amazon, ByteDance and Tesla, and helped deliver returns of 1,155% for his actively managed fund between 2000 and 2022.</body>

    <head>Swiss academic Tariq Ramadan goes on trial accused of rape</head>
    <body>The prominent Swiss academic and Islam scholar Tariq Ramadan has gone on trial in Geneva on charges of rape and sexual coercion. The 60-year-old told the court he denied allegations that he carried out an attack on a Swiss woman in a Geneva hotel in 2008. Ramadan was a professor of contemporary Islamic studies at the University of Oxford before taking a leave of absence in 2017 when rape allegations were first made against him by French women, in what was seen as the biggest repercussion of the #MeToo movement in France. He has also denied those allegations. The complainant in the Swiss case, who had converted to Islam in her youth, was 40 at the time of the alleged attack. She says she has faced threats and therefore wishes to be known under the assumed name of “Brigitte” during the trial. She said she had met Ramadan at a book signing in Geneva and later at a conference. They had corresponded via social media. A few months later he had invited her for coffee at his hotel after a conference. Ramadan is charged with three counts of rape against Brigitte in his hotel room on 28 October 2008, and one count of sexual coercion. Ramadan is accused of subjecting her to brutal sexual acts as well as beatings and insults. Ramadan, who could face up to 10 years in prison, denies all charges and told the court he was innocent. He said: “I’m here because I’m going to fight,” and denounced what he called “lies and manipulation” against him. He told the court he had multiple sclerosis and was currently receiving a monthly payment from Oxford. “This trial is an ordeal for my client, not therapy,” the Swiss complainant’s French lawyer, François Zimeray, told AFP. “She is waiting for recognition of the suffering that she has lived with for 15 years and which she has made it a painful duty to reveal. She expects a difficult, painful confrontation but she is ready for it, convinced that this fight is a duty for her as much as an ordeal.” The Swiss woman had filed a police complaint in Geneva after French women spoke to the media about alleged rapes by Ramadan in hotels in France. The French state prosecutor last year called for Ramadan to stand trial in France for the alleged rapes of four women between 2009 and 2016. It will fall to French investigating judges to rule whether those cases should go to trial. Ramadan was arrested in France in 2018 and spent nine months in prison on remand over the French rape allegations before being released on probation and barred from leaving the country. He was given exceptional authorisation to attend the Geneva trial this week. In recent years, Ramadan had repeatedly said allegations of rape against him in France and Switzerland were a politically motivated plot and that he had been the victim of bias in the French justice system. The academic, who had advised successive British governments on Islam and society, denied all allegations. The three-day trial in Geneva will be heard by a panel of judges who will return a verdict on 24 May.</body>

    <head>Police hunt suspects after more than a dozen cars set alight in Dorset</head>
    <body>Police are hunting suspected arsonists who caused havoc when they set fire to 13 cars in usually peaceful Dorset neighbourhoods. The apparently random incidents in suburbs of Poole and Wimborne Minster took place over a three-hour period and led to 65 calls to the fire service. Residents in one street were awoken at 1.20am to find four vehicles ablaze. One woman was so frightened that she and her two young daughters fled their home in their pyjamas, fearing the flames would spread from her car to the building. The cars affected included a Nissan Micra, Fiat Panda, BMW X5 and an Audi A1. One witness, Poppy Baker, 57, a credit controller, said: “At about 1.30am I saw this orange glow from my window. A Ford Ka was burning and there was so much heat the paint on my front door was melting. “The car belongs to a mother and she ran out the house in her pyjamas with her two young daughters. The fire engulfed the car very quickly. I’m told a man had been seen running away from a fire and someone said they saw a man jumping on the back of a motorbike. Everyone is in shock.” Maggie Stirrup, 70, said: “I was woken up with my husband at around 2am. We looked out the window and saw our neighbour’s car on fire. It was right next to our door and my husband is in a wheelchair. I didn’t know how we would get out if it spread.” Darren Trickett, 60, whose Land Rover Discovery was destroyed, said: “I woke up when I heard a bang, I didn’t know what was happening. I looked out the window and saw my car in flames. I was worried that the engine might explode. Local residents described the scene as ‘like a war zone’. Photograph: Jesse Bartlett/PA “I ran out of the house to try to get the fire extinguisher from the boot but the central locking wouldn’t work. I just stood and watched. I just can’t believe it happened here.” Chloe Torring, whose Nissan car was burnt out, said: “My neighbour woke me up and I saw my car burning and I just couldn’t believe it. Why would someone do something like this?’ Kayleigh Humphires, 33, said: “The night sky was just glowing orange. It’s like a war zone out there today, there are so many burnt out cars.” The first blaze was reported in Wentworth Drive in Broadstone, a suburb of Poole, at 11.35pm, before three cars were torched on Oakley Hill, Merley, on the outskirts of Wimborne, at 1.08am. At 1.20am, fire crews were called to New Borough Road in Wimborne to reports of four cars alight. The suspects then moved on to Poole Road where they torched two more vehicles at 1.24am and at 1.35am set fire to another car on the road, which spread to a home. The rampage ended with two cars being set ablaze on Merley Ways, Poole, at 2.26am. DS Simon Austin of Dorset police appealed for people with any CCTV that may have captured the arsonists to come forward. He said: “These incidents have affected a large number of victims in the wider Wimborne area and we are aware that this will cause concern.” A Dorset and Wiltshire fire service spokesperson said: “Between 11.30pm yesterday and just before 2.30am, our service control centre received approximately 65 999 calls about vehicle fires in the Wimborne and Poole areas.”</body>

    <head>Thailand’s opposition parties start alliance talks after voters reject military rule</head>
    <body>Thailand’s opposition parties have secured by far the largest number of votes in national elections, delivering a damning verdict to the military-backed government that has ruled for nearly a decade. Move Forward, a progressive opposition party popular with young Thais, surpassed expectations by winning the most votes and seats and said on Monday that it was ready to form a government. Its leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, told media he had invited Pheu Thai, the party associated with the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and four other opposition parties to form an alliance. “I am Pita Limjaroenrat, the next prime minister of Thailand,” he said in Bangkok, vowing to be a “prime minister for all”. Pheu Thai later confirmed it had agreed to Pita’s proposal to form an opposition coalition. Related: Young Thais look to Pita Limjaroenrat to bust military-royalist grip on power For any of the opposition parties to take power, they will need to form a coalition that has numbers strong enough to pass through a system that is weighed in favour of the military-backed candidates. A future prime minister will be voted on not just by the 500-seat house of representatives, whose membership is be dictated by the election results, but also by the senate, whose 250 members were appointed by the military after the last coup. It is unclear if senators’ votes will reflect the will of the people, especially given Move Forward’s ambition to reform Thailand’s lese-majesty law. Pita Limjaroenrat warned of a “hefty price” to pay if there was interference in the election outcome that would lead to the formation of a minority government. The election commission chair, Ittiporn Boonprakon, said Move Forward had secured 151 of the 500 available seats, while Pheu Thai had 141. The numbers would need to be confirmed before they could be pronounced as official, which would happen within 60 days. He said voter turnout was the highest recorded, at 75.22%. Supporters of the Move Forward party react to the election results. Photograph: Sirachai Arunrugstichai/Getty Images Prayut Chan-ocha, a former army chief who first came to power in a coup in 2014, and who ran a staunchly nationalist campaign, was trailing far behind with 36 seats. However, this is sufficient for him to still be in the running for prime minister, in the event he can cobble together a coalition. Move Forward, which wants to reform the lese-majesty law – a taboo topic – and has taken a strong stance in calling for military reform, shocked even some of its own supporters by outperforming expectations on Sunday. Throughout the national count, it was neck and neck with Pheu Thai, a heavyweight opposition party that had been aiming to win by a landslide. Over the past two decades, parties linked to the Shinawatra family have repeatedly proved unbeatable at the ballot box, winning the most seats in every election since 2001. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, described the results as “staggering” and “historic”. Pheu Thai had campaigned using its old approach of populist policies, he said. “Move Forward takes the game to the next level with institutional reform. That’s the new battleground in Thai politics.” This was the first election in which the lese-majesty law was openly discussed by candidates – a change brought about by the 2020 youth-led mass protests where activists risked jail to call for the influence and wealth of the monarchy to be curbed. Move Forward, whose own candidates have been charged under the law, is the only party to make a clear commitment to reforming it. Pheu Thai said the matter should be discussed in parliament but is strongly opposed to the law being scrapped, while Conservative parties all fiercely oppose any change. Pita, 42, a former executive of a ride-hailing app, said: “The sentiment of the era has changed and it’s right. And today it’s a new day and hopefully it’s full of bright sunshine of hope going forward.” Related: Thailand elections: young people want radical change in a country they say is stagnating A joint session of the House of Representatives will be held with the Senate in July to select the new prime minister. It is unclear how senators will vote. Somchai Sawangkarn told Reuters, that any candidate “must be honest and not cause problems in the country. Hitler was elected in a majority but led the country to world war … If there is a possibility of creating division in the country, I will not vote for them.” Opposition candidates could also face court cases that could prevent them from staying in power. Move Forward is the reincarnation of Future Forward, an equally outspoken party that performed well in the 2019 election and was closed down by the constitutional court the following year, after it was accused of breaking funding rules. Last week, a complaint was filed against Pita, claiming he owned undeclared shares in a media company. He has denied any wrongdoing. Complaints have also been filed against Pheu Thai. On Sunday, Prayuth slipped away quietly from his United Thai Nation party headquarters, where there were few supporters to be seen. “I hope the country will be peaceful and prosper,” Prayuth said. “I respect democracy and the election. Thank you.” Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</body>

    <head>West Ham to appoint director of football in attempt to fix transfer shortcomings</head>
    <body>West Ham are set to appoint a director of football in an attempt to address misgivings over their recent transfer strategy. A recruitment process is under way and changes are expected at the club this summer. Potential candidates have been identified and include the former Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards, Monaco’s Paul Mitchell, Brentford’s Lee Dykes and Atalanta’s Lee Congerton. There have been discussions with Victor Orta, who recently parted company with Leeds, but the Spaniard is regarded as an unlikely appointment. Related: Mbeumo and Wissa guide Brentford to victory against distracted West Ham West Ham, who are yet to decide whether to keep David Moyes as manager, have endured a disappointing campaign despite spending close to £160m on players last summer. Control over signings was largely handed to Moyes. Sources have spoken of dissatisfaction within the hierarchy over the club’s business. If Moyes stays it is anticipated his influence over transfer business would be reduced. Moyes would have to decide whether he is willing to work with a director of football. Moyes is close with Rob Newman, the head of recruitment. Questions are set to be raised over Newman’s role. West Ham, six points above the bottom three, have been battling against relegation despite their outlay. It is felt that bringing in a director of football would help the sporting director, Mark Noble. The former captain was appointed in January and the board are impressed with how he has settled. It has been recognised, though, that there is not enough support or experience around Noble. West Ham want to bolster their scouting network and relieve the demands on Noble, who is expected to have a large say over the academy. West Ham had a director of football when Mario Husillos joined in 2018. Husillos was heavily associated with the then manager, Manuel Pellegrini, and left when the Chilean was fired in December 2019. The latest search for a director of football is being led by David Sullivan, West Ham’s largest shareholder. Sullivan has reached out to intermediaries and remains the most influential figure at the club. The co-owner will take charge of finding a manager if Moyes leaves. Moyes’s future could depend on whether West Ham win the Europa Conference League. They are 2-1 up before the second leg of their semi-final at AZ Alkmaar on Thursday. Moyes could earn himself another season if he brings West Ham their first major trophy since 1980. Winning the Conference League would also earn qualification into the Europa League. There is disquiet over how West Ham have fared in the league. They are not safe from relegation after losing to Brentford on Sunday and there have been complaints over the style. West Ham are monitoring Graham Potter, Brendan Rodgers and Celtic’s Ange Postecoglou. There are indications that Paulo Fonseca will spend another season at Lille. At least one other candidate is lurking in the background. West Ham had hoped to kick on after finishing seventh last season. Moyes and Newman were handed significant funds and chased a number of targets but the spending has produced mixed results. The biggest disappointment has been the £35.5m Italy striker Gianluca Scamacca, from Sassuolo. Scamacca, who has struggled to settle, has three league goals and is out for the season with a knee injury. Flynn Downes, Emerson Palmieri, Thilo Kehrer and Maxwel Cornet have also struggled to live up to expectations, and Alphonse Areola is yet to displace Lukasz Fabianski as the No 1 goalkeeper. There has been more encouragement from the Morocco defender Nayef Aguerd, who joined for £29.8m. Lucas Paquetá has produced flashes of class in midfield since becoming West Ham’s record buy at £51.5m from Lyon. But West Ham will need more hits than misses this summer given that they are likely to lose Declan Rice. The midfielder is attracting heavy interest from Arsenal and Manchester United. West Ham hope to receive at least £100m for Rice but they would need to spend the money wisely.</body>

    <head>London woman, 95, unable to use breathing machine due to persistent home flooding</head>
    <body>A 95-year-old woman receiving palliative care has been left unable to use her breathing equipment due to power cuts caused by persistent flooding at her council-run house. Asabu Laher, who lives in Clapham, south London, is bed-bound, blind and suffering from organ failure. She is receiving end-of-life support at the home she shares with her three children, who have learning difficulties. Laher’s family say the house floods monthly, causing power outages – and that they first flagged the issue a year and a half ago. The flooding, which started more than 30 years ago, is partly due to damage to the external drains caused by tree roots. “They did tanking [the application of a coating] around the walls in the basement many years ago now. But … the problem has returned. It is ruining the foundations of the property and the main electricity has stopped working with the amount of water in there. Over time, the foundations will become soft and the building may collapse,” said Laher’s grandson Maajid Patel. He added the council sends a company around to drain the water after it floods, although the company does not always arrive. However, he claims there has been no attempt to address what is causing the deluge. “We have said if you cannot be bothered to fix the leak in the basement then at least bring mains electricity points upstairs [to avoid power outages],” he said. On 3 May, the water level in the basement reached 73cm, causing a total power outage to the entire house. It meant Laher could not use the machine that helps her with breathing. All the refrigerated food also spoiled. Her family phoned the council at midday, her grandson said, but nobody showed up to fix the issue after an initial appraisal at 2pm. “I called Lambeth again at 7pm to chase it up and was told by two colleagues that they were due to come out for the repair. By this point my grandmother was struggling to breathe already as she hadn’t had access to her oxygen tank for the entire day,” Patel said. “Unfortunately, as we expected, nobody came and at 11pm we had to put my grandmother in a taxi and pull her out of her home and into our house in Streatham so we could provide her with working electricity for her oxygen machine. We have had to use makeshift bed arrangements due to the neglect of Lambeth repairs,” he added. Patel says he has struggled to get any “compassion” from Lambeth about their situation. “This has been a constant cycle for almost one-and-a-half year now and we have unfortunately received minimal support from Lambeth repairs. We are completely drained, broken and tired from the constant lack of care from Lambeth.” Laher pays rent at the property, and her children are cared for by council support and relatives, who also come regularly to help. A spokesperson for Lambeth council said it accepted its services “fell below its normal standards on this occasion”, apologising to “Mrs Laher and her family for any frustration and inconvenience this has caused them”. They added: “The council has carried out a number of repairs to tackle leaks at this property. But it has proved to be a complex problem – for example, a CCTV survey has found that multiple tree roots have damaged the external drains. “Our contractors will be at the property tomorrow to drain the basement and to work on the longer-term issues with the drains over the coming days. The electricity supply will be restored once it is tested and given the all-clear.” In February, the housing ombudsman warned that Lambeth council had to improve after five recent incidents, including a vulnerable child left without vital repairs. The ombudsman expressed concern for how its actions were at times disrespectful and lacked empathy for the impact of its service failures on residents.</body>

    <head>Average monthly rent outside London now more than £1,000, says agency</head>
    <body>The average new monthly rent outside London has passed £1,000 for the first time, figures show, with tenants in Great Britain now typically paying 25% more than they were at the start of the Covid pandemic. The estate agent Hamptons, which issued the data, warned that the rate of rent rises was “unlikely to slow considerably due to the number of landlords looking to pass on their rising costs” and this may force some tenants to downsize or relocate to a cheaper area. Many landlords with buy-to-let mortgages have seen their costs rise sharply after 12 consecutive interest rate rises and the chaos of last autumn’s Truss government mini-budget. The average rent on a newly let home outside the capital rose to £1,002 a month in April, according to Hamptons, which was 7.8%, or £72, higher than the figure a year earlier. Meanwhile, the London rental market is continuing to speed ahead of the rest of the country: annual rental growth in the capital was running well ahead of inflation at 17.2%, said the firm, with the average monthly bill passing £2,200 for the first time last month. That would cost the average tenant moving into a new home an extra £3,895 a year. Across Great Britain as a whole, the average monthly rent rose 11.1% year-on-year in April to reach a new high of £1,249 – the second-highest figure for rental growth across the country on record. Overall, rents across the country have leapt 25% since the eve of the pandemic. This is the latest in a series of surveys that have highlighted how sizeable rent hikes – also fuelled by severe shortages of properties – are piling yet more pressure on households already facing severe strain. Earlier this year, some city mayors in England called for an immediate rent freeze and a ban on evictions to help renters deal with the cost of living crisis. Some in the property sector have claimed that the government’s renters’ reform bill, which will include a ban on property owners evicting tenants without showing any fault on the tenants’ part, could prompt more buy-to-let landlords to quit the sector, causing rents to rise further. At the end of April, the property website Rightmove reported that average monthly asking rents outside London had soared to a record high of £1,190 in the first quarter of this year, with tenants in the capital paying more than £2,500 for the first time. Hamptons said that in February 2013, when it launched its lettings index, the average tenant who moved into a new home outside London paid £677 a month – £325 less than in April 2023. That represents a 48% increase in a decade. Aneisha Beveridge, the firm’s head of research, said: “Affordability constraints will likely hit the brakes on rental growth at some point this year; however, it’s unlikely to slow considerably due to the number of landlords looking to pass on their rising costs.”</body>

    <head>Philadelphia Inquirer severely disrupted by cyber-attack</head>
    <body>The Philadelphia Inquirer is scrambling to restore its systems and resume normal operations after it became the latest major media organization to be targeted in a cyber-attack. With no regular Sunday newspaper and online stories also facing some delays, the cyber-attack has triggered the worst disruption to the Inquirer in decades. The attack aimed at Philadelphia’s paper of record has been reported to the FBI. Related: Guardian confirms it was hit by ransomware attack Disruption to the Inquirer, the most read daily in Pennsylvania and the third-longest continuously serving newspaper in the US, comes as the city prepares for a mayoral primary election on Tuesday. The Inquirer’s offices are closed through at least Tuesday, and the company is looking for co-working space to serve as a makeshift newsroom for election night. It is unclear when normal editorial services will be restored. News organisations are increasingly being targeted by sophisticated cyber-attacks – as have government agencies, hospitals, universities and the business sector. In December, the Guardian was hit by a ransomware attack in which the personal data of staff in the UK and US was accessed. The print edition continued uninterrupted but the incident, which was probably triggered by a “phishing” attempt in which the victim is tricked – often through email – into downloading malware, forced the Guardian to close its offices for several months. The Los Angeles Times in 2018 was affected by a major ransomware attack in which a kind of malicious software that essentially paralyses a system – holding it to ransom – and demands payment to free the system. Few details about the attack on the Inquirer have been released to staff members or readers. It is unclear whether any personal data has been exposed, exactly which systems had been breached, or who was behind the attack and what motivations they had. In an email, the Inquirer’s publisher, Lisa Hughes. said “we are currently unable to provide an exact timeline” on when operations will be fully restored. “We appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding as we work to fully restore systems and complete this investigation as soon as possible.” Monday’s newspapers were printed albeit without any classified ads. The incident is the greatest publication disruption to the state’s largest news organisation since a blizzard shut operations down for two days in January 1996, the company said.</body>

    <head>Low birthrate is UK’s top priority, Tory MP tells rightwing conference</head>
    <body>A Conservative MP has claimed the UK’s low birthrate is the most pressing policy issue of the generation and is caused in part by “cultural Marxism” stripping young people of any hope, at the start of a populist-tinged conference in London. Addressing the National Conservatism gathering, run by a US-based thinktank, Miriam Cates said western countries faced an existential threat from falling reproduction, arguing that a lack of family-friendly tax policy in the UK played a significant role, as well as a shortage of housing. But Cates, seen as a rising star in a new generation of culture-war keen Tory MPs, also blamed too many young people attending university, the devaluing of motherhood, and what she described as the mass indoctrination of young minds. “Having a home, a secure job and support from your family, community and nation are not the only conditions to starting a family,” Cates told the event in Westminster. “You must also have hope for the future. And that hope is not reaching so many of our young people today, because liberal individualism has proved to be completely powerless to resist a cultural Marxism that is systematically destroying our children’s souls.” “When culture, schools and universities openly teach that our country is racist, our heroes are villains, humanity is killing the Earth, you are what you desire, diversity is theology, boundaries are tyranny and self-restraint is oppression, is it any wonder that mental health conditions, self-harm and suicide, and epidemic levels of anxiety and confusion characterise the emerging generation?” Asked whether Rishi Sunak agreed with this latter concern, Downing Street appeared to say this was the case, referring to recent concerns Cates had raised with the prime minister over sex education in schools. “We recognise there is significant concern in this and that’s why that the DfE [Department for Education] is working through additional guidance for schools and support for teachers,” Sunak’s official spokesperson said. The use of “cultural Marxism” as a description by the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP is controversial because it is a term referring to a conspiracy theory often associated with the far right and antisemitism. When Suella Braverman, the home secretary – who is addressing the conference later on Monday – used the phrase in a 2019 speech, she was criticised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Cates’s argument for a higher birthrate echoes those made by European populist leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, although they are explicit about contrasting this with what they see as a parallel threat from immigration. Braverman’s speech is to make a case against any increase in immigration, arguing that Britons should be trained to work in haulage, butchery and crop picking to avoid the need to fill vacancies with foreign workers. Cates said the low birthrate was “the one overarching threat to British conservatism, and to the whole of western society”, and was a greater concern that the climate emergency, Russia or China. Criticising no-fault divorce and the expansion of childcare, Cates said the rise of university attendance also played a role: “Many graduates are saddled with debt, and so are unable to afford to buy a house and start a family. “Spending so much time and money on education also makes it much more difficult, particularly for women, to decide when is a good time to pause and have children.” Several other speakers scheduled for the event – known as NatCon – are more explicitly populist or in favour of the ideas of people like Orbán and Donald Trump, including the Trump-supporting Ohio senator JD Vance, who will speak virtually. After Cates spoke, Yoram Hazony, the Israeli-US thinktanker behind the NatCon organisation, told the event that the UK was plagued with woke “neo-Marxist” agitators who want to detach Britons from their entire past, and called for a return to mandatory military service. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former cabinet minister, used his address to give an intellectual argument for national conservatism and to delve into contemporary UK politics. He reiterated his condemnation of Sunak for breaking a promise to repeal any EU-origin laws by the end of this year, while also urging people to support the prime minister “because the alternative is far worse”. In one striking intervention, the former business secretary labelled his party’s introduction of mandatory voter ID as gerrymandering that backfired, likening it to Labour’s idea of extending votes to long-settled EU nationals in the UK. “Parties that try to gerrymander end up finding that their clever scheme comes back to bite them, as dare I say we found in insisting on voter ID for election,” he said. “We found that the people who didn’t have ID were elderly, and they by and large voted Conservative. “And we upset a system that worked perfectly well. One of the glories of our country was that we did it on an honesty basis.”</body>

    <head>Italian man fined nearly €900 for filling in pothole hits out at ‘injustice’</head>
    <body>An Italian pensioner has pledged to fight against the “injustice” of being fined almost €900 for fixing a pothole. Claudio Trenta was so frustrated by the local council’s failure to repair the 30cm pothole on a pedestrian crossing in Barlassina, a small town in Lombardy, that the 72-year-old decided to take action himself by filling it with cold bitumen. This led to a fine of €882 (£767) – but has also triggered a debate about the potholes plaguing Italy’s roads. In a post on Facebook, Trenta shared a photo of the letter he received from the police accusing him of violating the highway code. He was fined for carrying out a potentially dangerous job in a public space without permission or the competence to do so. Trenta has been ordered to restore the hole to its original state. “If they think I’m an idiot, they are wrong,” he told Corriere della Sera. “They’ve provoked me, and so now I’m filing a countercomplaint against the council for negligence.” Related: Filling a gap: the clandestine gang fixing Rome illegally Trenta, who says he reported the pothole to the local authority several times over three months, has received a wave of solidarity from across Italy. One commenter on Facebook wrote: “Today I sent a protest email to Barlassina town hall. I’m aware of the realities in Calabria and Sicily, where the streets have been reduced to sieves and if people don’t take action themselves, everything collapses.” Another wrote: “The council ought to be reimbursing you for the money spent on a bag of bitumen.” Vittorio Sgarbi, an undersecretary at the ministry of culture, joined the debate. “In addition to the highway code, there is common sense,” he said. “Common sense should have prompted the local police to thank this gentleman.” The pothole debacle has provoked significant media interest, with Trenta being invited to appear on the Mediaset programme Le Iene on Tuesday night to shed more light on the case. “I’m not used to all this publicity,” he told Monza Today. “I will fight to the bitter end to have this fine cancelled as, in my opinion, it’s an injustice. Why fine me instead of those who knew about the problem and failed to intervene?”</body>

    <head>‘It takes a village to protect a child’: why Childhood Day matters</head>
    <body>The daily commute isn’t usually a life-changing experience for most of us. But it was for Darren Sobers, who never imagined that flicking through a newspaper on the tube might one day lead to him trekking the Great Wall of China to raise money for the NSPCC. “I don’t even normally read that particular paper, but I picked it up that day and saw an article about the trip,” he says. “In that moment, I realised I could use my time to benefit children who need protecting and safeguarding. It was just that Monday morning feeling that I could be doing more than this. I could do something really fulfilling and impactful.” After contacting the charity to find out more, Sobers joined the trek, spending three weeks in China where he helped raise thousands of pounds for the NSPCC and made some lifelong friends in the process. “The NSPCC made it really simple for me to get involved, with clear travel instructions and information about everything I would need to think of,” he says. “And it helped that every potential stop light along the way was green – I wasn’t sure if I would be eligible for the trip but I was, and I didn’t think my employer would approve three weeks off work, but they did. The more positive signs I encountered, the more I felt this was something I had to do.” Through his involvement in the journey and the connections made with other NSPCC supporters, Sobers heard about other fundraising events, including Childhood Day. Inspired to continue using his time for a good cause, he joined in with collecting donations from his local community on Childhood Day last year – dressed in a repurposed Halloween costume. Relationships are at the heart of Sobers’ commitment to the charity, as is the case for many NSPCC volunteers. A staff member and her husband, both of whom Sobers met on the trek in China, have become close friends and, he says, their values inspire him. “Through our friendship I learned how little it takes to make an impact; raising just a few hundred pounds can make such a difference in the lives of children, which really made me realise what a precious commodity my time is. These days people might feel they can’t offer financial support to a charity but giving your time is invaluable.” Illustration: Beya Rebaï/The Guardian Volunteering with the NSPCC for Childhood Day also helped Sobers to build new connections with his local community. In particular, he recounts feeling moved by the reaction of the public and the sight of children asking their parents for change to drop into the collection buckets. “These are kids who – had life dealt them different cards – might themselves need help from the NSPCC,” he says. But Childhood Day isn’t just about fundraising. Keeping children safe requires a community-wide approach, which is why building awareness of the work the charity does is so important. “They say it takes a village to raise a child but I think it also takes a village to protect a child,” says Sobers. “People can learn to recognise the signs of abuse or vulnerability that might not be obvious on the surface but which show in a child’s behaviour,” he says. “A collaborative pool can always do more than one individual, so it’s important to have multiple people – parents, friends, childminders and teachers – all looking out for children who could be in need of help. Being involved with the NSPCC has raised my awareness about vulnerable children and how silent their screams for help can sometimes be.” Sue Wardle, an ex-primary school teacher who has been involved with the charity since 2005, is “immensely proud” to be a volunteer with the NSPCC and says the experience has given her a sense of purpose, alongside camaraderie and fun. She became chair of an active fundraising committee in Staffordshire and helped to raise more than £250,000 over a number of years. Related: ‘Start early, have open conversations’: how to keep children safe online Wardle heard about Childhood Day from her local NSPCC community fundraising manager and liked the idea of joining together with other supporters of the charity in a common cause. “Cruelty and abuse take many forms, so the more people know about the signs – and the more children realise that they can speak out to a trusted person in their community – the better chance we stand of preventing it,” she says. “Children need to know that there are people who will listen to them and help them. Childhood Day is important because the publicity it attracts helps spread the word about the work the NSPCC does to prevent abuse and neglect of children in the UK.” Wardle says there is a great range of options for anyone who wants to get involved with Childhood Day this year, from participating in the Childhood Day Mile to helping with a collection, or organising a fundraising event such as a bake sale. “You will get lots of help from [NSPCC’s] head office and our new king is keen for communities to get together and volunteer too.” And if you’re reading this on the way to work and find yourself, like Sobers, inspired to get involved, he says this: “Just do it. Jump in. It only takes 10 seconds of courage.” Childhood Day is a day that brings everyone in the UK together to have fun and help protect children. Whether you join the Childhood Day Mile, volunteer or donate – we need everyone to play their part.</body>

    <head>‘Start early, have open conversations’: how to keep children safe online</head>
    <body>Holly* thought the man she was talking to online could be trusted. But things turned sinister when he convinced the 14-year-old to send him nude pictures of herself, which he then threatened to share with her friends and family unless she sent more or paid him money. Holly felt trapped and afraid. She told the NSPCC’s Childline that she had reported it to the social network she was using to communicate with the man, but she had not heard back from them. “I don’t want to tell the police because my parents would then know what I did and they would be so disappointed,” she said. Holly’s disturbing story illustrates how easily children can be drawn into online sexual abuse. During Covid there was a 374% rise in the number of sexual images and videos that children and young people took themselves and shared online, according to the Internet Watch Foundation. While some children have shared “self-generated” sexual images, others are unwittingly exposed to disturbing content. Last year, more than a third (36%) of children aged between eight and 17 saw something online which was “worrying or nasty”, according to the communications regulator Ofcom. This could include self-harm or pro-suicidal content, pornography or terrorist beheading videos, says Kate Edwards, associate head of child safety online at the NSPCC. “Algorithms are driving the content that these children and young people are seeing,” she says. “A child may have looked at a post about self-harm, maybe out of curiosity, or something may have appeared on their Explore page. Once they’ve engaged with one or two similar posts the app will start sharing more and more of the same content with them.” And because algorithms are linked to an individual’s online experience, it can be very difficult for parents to see the same content their children have seen. So, what does the NSPCC suggest parents do to reduce online risks, and what signs should they look out for that indicate their child may have been exposed to harm? Parents who restrict the time their children spend online and limit when they can use their online devices or smartphones will still not be doing enough to protect them from predators, says Edwards. “The thing is, a child can be exposed to online abuse after being online for five minutes or five hours,” she says. Key to protecting a child is for parents to create a “no-blame” culture at home. “We get Childline calls from children who have been on their devices and exposed to disturbing content during the night when their parents are asleep,” says Edwards. “The children are then too scared to wake their parents because they should be asleep. It’s important for parents to keep an open mind and to talk to their children about what they are experiencing online, and be open to hearing what they have to say.” Turning on parental control settings on wifi, phone networks, individual apps and devices is vital. The move blocks and filters upsetting or inappropriate content, as well as managing what different family members can see. Parents, though, will have to adopt a different strategy for younger children. Seventeen percent of three- and four-year-olds now have a smartphone, alongside 28% of five- to seven-year-olds. “The difficulty with younger children is that they don’t know how they can stop watching something that scares them,” says Edwards. “The thing to do here is to teach them how to press the sleep button on their device and then bring the device to you,” she says. It is also key at this early age to start “active conversations” about the online world and how it is important not to keep a secret or share images. “I don’t think parents are naive about the online risks, but I think it’s very difficult to keep up to date because technology is moving so quickly,” says Edwards. “Some of this is also quite tricky – parents think if they put a filter on the home wifi that it will stop anything coming through that you don’t want your children to see. No filter is 100% effective, which is why it’s also important to develop a strategy.” A clear sign of whether a child has been exposed to harm is if they become withdrawn and are fearful of their device every time they get a message, says Edwards. Another indicator is if they receive an unusual number of messages and look worried. Parents should also be alert if their child starts to use very adult language, has a number of new friends and new apps, or if they suddenly have a lot of extra money to spend, she says. Parental involvement in keeping their children safe online is especially important when self-regulation by tech companies appears to have failed to protect them. The NSPCC is hopeful that the online safety bill, which is currently going through parliament, will go some way towards creating a safer environment for children. It is crucial that the amendment it has lobbied for – to establish an advocacy body to represent the voice of the child and sound the alarm to any new online threats as they happen – is written into the statute books. “We get a rich insight when we listen to children at the moment,” says Edwards. “By having this formal advocacy body in place, children and young people will be written into the process of effective regulation.” * Name changed for safeguarding Childhood Day is a day that brings everyone in the UK together to have fun and help protect children.

    <head>German Greens suffer setback in Bremen local election</head>
    <body>The German Green party has endured another disappointing election night in the country’s smallest state, Bremen, as voters voice concerns about the social consequences of green transformation projects. The northern city state’s incumbent Social Democratic party mayor, Andreas Bovenschulte, emerged top in projected results from Sunday’s poll published by the local statistics office, with about 29.5% of the vote. This gives the centre-left the option to either continue governing with the Greens and the left-wing Die Linke, or form a “grand coalition” with the second-placed conservatives. Support for the German Greens, who have been in government at national level since December 2021, slid to 11.7%, down 5.6 percentage points compared with state elections in 2019, providing another sobering moment for the environmentalist party after an underwhelming result at Berlin’s repeat state elections in February. With only 475,500 eligible voters, the election in Germany’s smallest state is not considered a bellwether poll. Bovenschulte’s personality ratings played a strong role in the SPD’s strong showing, and national Green party leaders on Monday attributed their poor performance down to “local mistakes”. A month before the vote, Bremen’s Green transport senator, Maike Schaefer, had provoked local ire by scrapping the so-called “bread-roll button” in one of the city’s districts, a short-term free parking option at parking ticket machines designed to give locals just enough time to pop into a high-street bakery. On Monday, Schaefer announced she was stepping down from her post and retiring from politics. Parallels between the votes in Bremen and Berlin, however, will trouble the Green’s leadership. Even among a progressively minded urban electorate, the party was punished as it set about turning promises to reduce carbon emissions into action: Green voters who like the idea of car-free cities are now also concerned about the social consequences. Related: Berlin’s plan for a car-free city prompts bitter war of words The question whether the party’s stated mission to make the German economy more green will sufficiently heed citizens’ concerns has also been raised at a national level, where the Green economic minister, Robert Habeck, has endured a backlash against his plans to electrify the country’s gas-reliant heating sector. “Voters are scared of change, be it in their boiler room or on inner-city streets,” wrote news magazine Der Spiegel in response to the Bremen vote. “The Greens are not able to meet these fears at eye-level and with respect.” Bremen was the first state parliament that the Green party entered in 1979. But as the state with the highest rates of unemployment and social benefit recipients, it is also a region that will always put the party’s credibility on social issues to the test. On Monday, the German Green’s co-leader Ricarda Lang said that while her party would hold on to its core ecological projects, it had to get better at connecting these projects to “the material core of social security”.</body>

    <head>UK pledges more weapons for Ukraine as Zelenskiy meets Sunak at Chequers</head>
    <body>Volodymyr Zelenskiy hinted on an unannounced visit to the UK that Kyiv could soon receive F-16 fighter jets, saying he was hopeful of “very important” decisions soon on the subject with the help of the UK. The Ukrainian president flew in by helicopter on Monday morning for a one-to-one meeting with Rishi Sunak at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat, the latest stop in a tour of Europe that had already taken in Rome, Berlin and Paris. Britain promised to supply “hundreds of attack drones” capable of operating at a range of 200km, although this description did not match any known UK capability, and the Ministry of Defence refused to give any extra details as to what was on offer. Speculation centred on whether the drones are a 3D-printed suicide drone made by the UK defence company QinetiQ. A press release from the company referring to them was removed from its website in February after it was picked up and reported on by a specialist publication. Standing next to Sunak after the meeting, Zelenskiy said they had discussed fighter planes “because we can’t control the sky”, and he was positive about persuading the US and other western nations to supply them. “We want to create this jets coalition and I’m very positive with it,” Zelenskiy said. “We spoke about it and I see that in the closest time you will hear some, I think, very important decisions, but we have to work a little bit more on it.” Interactive Sunak, clearly happy to be with the Ukrainian leader, said he was supportive, while acknowledging the complexity of providing fighter jets. “It’s not just the provision of planes, it’s also the training of pilots and all the logistics that go alongside that and the UK can play a big part in that,” the prime minister said. The UK said in February that it would begin training Ukrainian pilots in standard Nato techniques, and Downing Street repeated that on Monday, saying the plan was to help “build a new Ukrainian air force with Nato-standard F-16 jets”. Britain does not use F-16s, which are made the US defence firm Lockheed Martin in South Carolina. Ukraine has been seeking to obtain them for some time to augment its small Soviet-standard air force because they are widely available, with about 3,000 in service in 25 countries. Both countries will have to persuade the US if Ukraine is to receive F-16s. Asked later on Monday if the US had changed its position on supplying the jets to Ukraine, John Kirby, a spokesperson for the White House’s National Security Council, gave a one-word reply: “No.” On Zelenskiy’s last trip to the UK, the president addressed both houses of parliament, asking for “wings for freedom” and pleading for Britain to give Ukraine European-made Typhoons. But that demand was dropped because it was deemed impractical, and Ukraine went back to calling for F-16s. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The Ukrainians made the decision to train their pilots on F-16 jets – you know the RAF don’t use those.” They added that subsequent to Zelenskiy’s previous trip, “the Ukrainians made clear they wish to use F-16s”. The long-range drones referred to by Downing Street appear to be similar in capability to Iranian-made Shahed-136s repeatedly used by Russia to bomb Ukraine’s cities, and would help Ukraine hit targets beyond the 50-mile range of the Himars rocket artillery, currently the principal longer-range weapon in its arsenal. One drone expert voiced concern that the UK and other European countries seemed focused on supplying “ever more lethal military hardware”. Chris Coles, of Drone Wars, said that instead of “escalating the conflict by supplying ever more lethal arms, the UK should be urging negotiations to end the war”. Over the preceding 48 hours, Germany had committed €2.7bn of military aid to Ukraine, including older Leopard 1 tanks and Marder fighting vehicles, while France said it would provide more AMX-10RC light tanks and train more of Kyiv’s troops as part of wider international efforts. Ukraine is expected launch a counteroffensive shortly as the weather improves, although Zelenskiy said it was not yet ready. “We really need some more time,” he said. “Not too much. We will be ready in some time.” Sunak took Zelenskiy to the Hawtrey Room, where Sir Winston Churchill gave some of his radio addresses during the second world war. The British leader then made a direct comparison between the two men, saying that in “the same way today, your leadership, your country’s bravery and fortitude are an inspiration to us all.” Additional reporting by David Smith in Washington</body>

    <head>Vernon Kay on Radio 2 review – not even a ‘warring’ Holly and Phil can hold the new man back</head>
    <body>There was one extra sung syllable in the name jingle – “Ver-non Kay!” instead of “Ken Bruce!” – but the new host, stepping in after his predecessor’s 31-year reign, seemed keen to reassure Bruce fans that the new regime would not be too revolutionary. After variously exclaiming: “Right, here we go! The adventure! Let it begin! Let’s do this!” the first two tracks were U2’s hit Beautiful Day and Chic’s Good Times, both of which he called “absolute classics”, possibly seeing off the social media fear-smear from Bruce devotees that the new man would fill the show with the sort of grungy stuff 49-year-olds like Kay are into. The biggest new feature – Vernon’s Vault, featuring selections from the BBC archive – is also decidedly retro, even leading to a rare Radio 2 airing these days for Frank Sinatra, whose death 25 years ago this week was one of the things Kay vaulted. Remarkably, a later track was 70 years old: Doris Day’s Once I Had a Secret Love from 1953, played for Kay’s mum’s birthday. Kay can have only a limited number of older relatives to leaven the records in this way, but “producer Phil” was trying to throw any Radio 2 veterans who tuned in to post fingers-in-ears emojis as the vaporwave and witch house tracks banged out. The first guest on Tracks of My Years (a Bruce-era holdover) – Suggs from Madness – began his career when Kay was two. Such a slick anecdotalist was another reassurance to wavering listeners and Suggs’ first selection gave a second play of the day for Sinatra, with his 1961 recording of a 1937 song, A Foggy Day in London Town. That provided BBC balance to Kay’s opening mission statement: “We’re not going to be London-centric: this show is about you!” which risked confusing listeners in London. Proving his status as a Radio 2 trouper, Gary Davies, the interim presenter between Bruce and Kay, was the emergency breakfast show fill-in for Zoe Ball and so, not considered hot enough for a permanent slot, had to spend the last part of his segment reading out motivational texts to Kay from listeners. Between Kay’s early tunes, there were also motivational voicenotes from new airwave mates Ball, Scott Mills and Jo Whiley. Kay mentioned that he had worked with them at “’tother place” – code that perhaps acknowledged complaints from older listeners about Radio 1 being recreated on Radio 2. At 10am, Kay could have done anything he wanted, while the nation’s media corps watched ITV’s This Morning to see if Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, co-stars reported in wild weekend headlines to be on Gallagher-brothers-like terms, would agree to share their sofa. (They did, choreographed to sit closer to each other and gaze into each other’s eyes like a dating app advert.) As Bruce opened his Greatest Hits Radio show with Blondie’s 1979 single Heart of Glass, Kay went with something younger: Abba’s Lay All Your Love on Me, from 1980. Throughout the second hour, Kay, texters, contestants and weathercasters and sportscasters kept telling each other they were “smashing it”. Touchingly, Kay was still nervous enough to answer his own cry of: “How good is that?” with: “Brilliant!” Producer Phil needs to find him a better 10.30am quiz. Ten to the Top, a pop trivia quiz, is, compared with PopMaster (which Bruce took with him to Greatest Hits Radio), like listening to Blue after the Beatles. Audibly relaxing in the final stretch, Kay made two minor slips, suggesting that he listens to Greg James’s Radio 1 breakfast show (the bosses will get him on Ball) and giving Bruce supporters one of their few victories of the morning, when he yelped embarrassingly over one intro: “Check out the slap bass on that. That was fu-un-kee!” But true to what seemed a classic-rich playlist strategy, he finished the first show with the Rolling Stones’ Satisfaction, from 1965, nine years before he was born; he would be justified for feeling the emotion that Mick Jagger hymned. Kay had described following Bruce as equivalent to taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. Ferguson’s replacement, David Moyes, won his first league game 4-1 (Kay came out at least 2-1 up), but failed to complete the first year of his contract. In music radio, as in football, the trick is relentless consistency – which is the DJ’s next post-Bruce challenge.</body>

    <head>Emanuel Ax review – quicksilver agility and a model of good musical sense</head>
    <body>Chipping Campden music festival regularly boasts a lineup of soloists that would put many of its better-known counterparts to shame. Outstanding pianists are a feature of its programmes: Emanuel Ax has become an almost annual visitor to the Cotswold town, and the two weeks of concerts this year, the last to be planned by Charlie Bennett who founded the festival in 2002, also include recitals by Paul Lewis (the festival’s president), András Schiff and Piotr Anderszewski, as well as Christine Rice and Kate Royal, the Academy of Ancient Music and the Takács and Škampa Quartets. Ax’s recital was devoted to Schubert and Liszt. His wonderfully straightforward, unfussy approach to piano playing is perfectly matched to Schubert’s sonatas, and his performances of the two that framed this programme, the early A major sonata D664, and the last of all, the B flat major D960, were models of intelligence and good musical sense. The account of the A major seemed relaxed but never indulgent; every phrase was perfectly weighted and individually coloured and given its own expressive space. Every phrase was perfectly weighted and individually coloured The B flat sonata offers different challenges of scale, of course, but Ax showed that the same principles of directness coupled with a refusal to overcomplicate things could be just as effective on that larger, more complex canvas, too. The great paragraphs of the opening movement were unfolded with unforced inevitability, the melody of the andante tinged with just the right sense of tragic regret, while the scherzo and the finale seemed perfect vehicles for his quicksilver agility. Four of Liszt’s transcriptions of Schubert songs linked the two composers perfectly. However elaborate the decoration lavished on the songs, Ax ensured the melodic integrity of the originals was always preserved, so that, in Ständchen from Schwanengesang, for instance, Liszt’s rippling additions were never allowed to overshadow its essential melodic charm. And even in Vallée d’Obermann, from the Swiss volume of Liszt’s Années de Pèlerinage, the most ferocious climaxes were neither overwrought nor contrived; magically, Ax managed to bring the same imperishable musical qualities to Liszt’s baggy grandiloquence as he did to Schubert’s understated profundity. • Chipping Campden music festival continues until 22 May.</body>

    <head>Milan flinch in the shadow of the Curva as moment of destiny awaits</head>
    <body>Defeat was a disaster, but it was the aftermath that made international headlines: Milan’s players and manager silently facing their supporters in the away section of Spezia’s Stadio Alberto Picco while one fan addressed them with a monologue. There were no TV microphones close enough to listen in but bowed heads and solemn expressions made it appear as an act of submission: disobedient students being scolded by a master. Those present told it differently. “What happened beneath the Curva was something positive,” said Stefano Pioli. “They were only motivating us, pushing us to give our all.” The defender Simon Kjær echoed that sentiment, adding: “Our fans have surprised me in lots of good ways since we won the league. They have always been close to us.” Related: European football: Bayern stay top after hitting Schalke for six, Spezia stun Milan Even so, interpretations varied of what went down after Spezia’s 2-0 win. Writing in La Gazzetta dello Sport, the columnist Luigi Garlando asked whether the likes of Paolo Maldini would ever have tolerated being spoken down to. The former Milan and Italy defender, now a director at the club, famously berated a supporter who sought to lecture players on their attitude after they blew a 3-0 lead in the 2005 Champions League final. Milan’s players – like those of many clubs in Italy – go under the Curva to acknowledge fans after every game, win or lose. It is uncommon for individual supporters to be given an opportunity to address the team directly, as happened on Saturday, but not unprecedented. Whether it should happen is a grey area. The Milan ultras were not happy with the players 😳 pic.twitter.com/5xJkeedknm — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) May 13, 2023 The Italian Football Federation’s Code of Sporting Justice has specific clauses to prohibit “public stockades” in which players are obliged to attend and endure abuse. The governing body is understood to be gathering further information about what happened in La Spezia to determine whether any action needs to be taken – though it seems unlikely in this instance. Raised tensions could come as no surprise. Milan were still reeling from defeat by an identical scoreline in the home leg of their Champions League semi-final against Inter on Wednesday night. Fans had hoped to see a reaction against Spezia. Instead, there was a distinct sense of deja vu to a game in which Sandro Tonali produced Milan’s best chance with a shot against the post from outside the box. Milan fans have been left bitterly disappointed by recent results. Photograph: Tano Pecoraro/LaPresse LaPresse/Shutterstock Spezia were full of motivation, seeking to lever themselves back out of the relegation zone after they were overtaken by Verona the previous weekend. Their manager, Leonardo Semplici, has pulled off escape acts before, twice keeping Spal in the top flight before rescuing Cagliari in 2020-21. Yet his team were winless in eight games leading up to this clash with Milan. The gameplan was predictable, Spezia mostly sitting deep, aiming to keep the game alive long enough that their moment could arrive. Arkadiusz Reca offered occasional adventure from the left wing-back position, but scoring chances from open play were rare. Spezia’s first goal arrived instead from a corner in the 75th minute, Kelvin Amian heading Salvatore Esposito’s cross against the bar before Przemyslaw Wisniewski forced home the rebound. Related: ‘Football is about friendship’: the photo that captured an iconic Milan derby moment Milan conceded for a second time as they pushed to equalise. This time Esposito whipped a free kick over the wall and direct into the top corner of the net, Mike Maignan barely able to brush the ball with his fingertips. While all energies have, understandably, been focused on the Champions League semi-final, this loss could have more long-lasting consequences for Milan than the result of Tuesday’s return leg. The Rossoneri are fifth in Serie A, but a win here would have taken them to within a point of fourth-placed Lazio, who they beat the previous weekend. Neither side is ending the season strongly. Lazio have taken only four points from their last five matches and needed a 93rd-minute equaliser at home to Lecce on Friday. But Milan have won only three out of 11 league games since the start of March. Last week, Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of Redbird Capital, the owners of Milan, acknowledged that for all his emotional investment in the Champions League semi-final, qualifying for next season’s edition was still essential. The club recorded losses of more than €66m on last season’s accounts but football finance website calcioefinanza.it has reported that revenues from this season’s competition could help push the club into the black for the first time since 2006. Stefano Pioli remains popular with supporters, but he is not invulnerable. Photograph: Fabio Fagiolini/EPA There is more to the story than that. Milan have steadily reduced their wage bill in recent years, bringing costs to a more sustainable level, one of several reasons to believe their medium-term future remains bright. The club is expected to confirm the commitment of their biggest star, Rafael Leão, to a new five-year contract in the coming days. More pressing, though, is the question of whether he might be fit to play against Inter on Tuesday night. After missing the first leg with a thigh strain, Leão resumed training with teammates on Sunday. Pioli struck a cautiously optimistic tone when asked about the forward but said Monday’s practice would be decisive. Lazio 2-2 Lecce Salernitana 1-0 Atalanta Spezia 2-0 Milan Inter 4-2 Sassuolo Verona 0-1 Torino Monza 2-0 Napoli Fiorentina 2-0 Udinese Bologna 0-0 Roma Juventus 2-0 Cremonese Monday: Sampdoria v Empoli Even after leading Milan to a Serie A title last season, the manager knows his job could be at risk if this campaign ends poorly. Perhaps it is for that reason, too, that he is willing to prioritise the voice of supporters. Ultras from the Curva Sud have thus far continued to back his leadership. The chant of “Pioli is on fire” before the semi-final first leg kicked off at San Siro was deafening. On Sunday, several hundred supporters came to the Milanello training ground, where they were met at the gate by Pioli and his team. This time there was no monologue, only 10 minutes of chants, flags, and flares. As usual, the simplest song cut through the clearest. “Noi vogliamo questa vittoria” – “We want this win.”</body>

    <head>European economy expected to grow faster than forecast, says EU</head>
    <body>Europe’s economy is expected to grow faster than previously thought this year and next, despite high inflation and rising interest rates, according to the European Commission. The commission said the EU’s 27 members would grow at an average of 1% in 2023, up from a previous estimate of 0.8%. It nudged its forecast for growth in 2024 to 1.7% from 1.6%. The eurozone’s 20 members are expected to grow by 1.1% on average and 1.6% next year. Related: European Central Bank chief suggests firms are engaging in ‘greedflation’ By comparison, the UK economy is expected to be weaker, with growth of 0.25% expected this year and 0.75% in 2024, according to the Bank of England. With fears of a recession easing, EU growth so far this year has been stronger than expected when the last growth estimates were made in February, the commission said. “The EU economy is managing the adjustment to the shocks unleashed by the pandemic and Russia’s aggression of Ukraine remarkably well,” it said in a report. “Last year, the EU successfully managed to largely wean itself off Russian gas.” Interactive Ireland will lead EU growth league over the next two years as it has done over the past two years. Dublin is forecast to enjoy a growth rate of 5.5% and 5% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, after chalking up a growth rate of 13.6% in 2021 and 12% in 2022. France’s growth rate will accelerate from 0.7% in 2023 to 1.7% in 2024 while Germany’s economy, which was hit hardest by sanctions on Russian gas, is expected to expand by 0.2% this year and 1.4% next year. Estonia and Sweden are the only EU countries to suffer a contraction this year – Sweden by 0.5% and Estonia by 0.4%, before both make modest recoveries in 2024. For the first time, European Commission officials examined the prospects for Ukraine’s economy in its quarterly forecast – a move made in response to Brussels accepting the war-torn country as a candidate for EU membership last year. The report said that before the Russian invasion last year, Ukraine’s economic development had been held back by “a somewhat uneven implementation of structural reforms”. It also suffered from regular interference from vested interests, plus “a high degree of corruption, chronically low levels of investment, and territorial disputes also linked to the 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia”. Yet Ukraine had demonstrated remarkable resilience during the war and much of its economy was able to continue operating. Ukraine’s GDP is estimated to have slumped by 29% in 2022. This year growth is expected to be just 0.6%, rising to 4% in 2024, the commission said, although the path of the war will be crucial to the outcome for economic growth. The commission said that overall the forecasts were good news for European households and businesses. “The European economy has managed to contain the adverse impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, weathering the energy crisis thanks to a rapid diversification of supply and a sizeable fall in gas consumption. “Markedly lower energy prices are working their way through the economy, reducing firms’ production costs. It added: “Consumers are also seeing their energy bills fall, although private consumption is set to remain subdued as wage growth lags inflation.” Interactive Inflation remains higher than expected, as it has done in the UK, and was revised upwards compared with the winter forecast. Prices growth is now expected to average 5.8% across the eurozone in 2023, and drop to 2.8% in 2024 due to “persisting core price pressures”. Like the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB) has a 2% inflation target. The report said there was a risk inflation would persist, forcing the ECB to maintain high interest rates. European Commission officials warned individual countries against embarking on a spending spree to boost growth, saying this would “lean against” monetary policy and force a further tightening. Previously, inflation was forecast to average 5.6% this year in the eurozone, and 2.5% in 2024. The ECB has indicated that it will increase interest rates for the eurozone by at least 0.5 percentage points during the summer to almost 3.75% on its main deposit rate to reduce the pressure on prices.</body>

    <head>Erdoğan is in the lead in Turkey’s elections – and democracy is likely to be the loser</head>
    <body>It was a tense and confusing night after election polls closed in Turkey yesterday. The official result is still unclear, but a runoff between the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his main challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, looks increasingly likely. Neither seem to have reached the necessary 50% threshold to win the election outright, but Erdoğan is clearly in the lead. In a press conference in the early morning hours, Kılıçdaroğlu said he that he was confident that he would win the runoff. However, enthusiasm, both onstage and among his supporters, was muted. These were not the faces of winners. While many thought that the opposition’s campaign, centred around political reform, unity and an end to the toxic polarisation in the country, was a breath of fresh air; others have criticised Kılıçdaroğlu’s approach for targeting mostly those who already agreed with his views, for his blue-sky attitude and focus on positive soundbites on social media. In their 21 years in power, Erdoğan and the AKP have amassed incredible powers and resources, bending the mainstream media, the judiciary and state institutions to their will and their message. The opposition was always fighting an uphill battle. Its election campaign was run amid a ruthless and increasing crackdown on civil society and freedom of speech in Turkey. Human rights groups have been criminalised and sidelined over the past years. Journalists have been jailed for their reporting. NGOs were shut down. Civil society leaders have been put on trial on bogus terrorism charges. Government-appointed trustees replaced democratically elected local politicians in the predominantly Kurdish south-east. Women’s rights were put on the auction block for the sake of wooing ultraconservative parties and voters. Hate speech and violence against the LGBTQ+ community have soared. It would be cynical to argue that Kılıçdaroğlu’s election promise to return Turkey to democracy and the rule of law, with a seat at the table for everyone who wants to make their voice heard, was simply not attractive enough and too soft. It certainly is what millions of people in Turkey desperately wanted, and still want. This hope was reflected in the energy and courage of civil society in the runup to yesterday’s polls. The elections mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers who campaigned for Kılıçdaroğlu and other opposition parties, who rallied to get out the vote, who monitored voting, protected ballot boxes and reported inconsistencies. Civil society groups organised transportation for the people displaced from the regions affected by the devastating February earthquakes back to cities where they were still registered to vote. People there opened their homes to accommodate them. Video editors helped desperate youngsters whose parents requested filmed proof of them casting their vote in favour of Erdoğan. Voter turnout stood at a very high 88.8%, according to Turkey’s supreme election council (YSK). Despite this, the results so far point to a loss for Kılıçdaroğlu and his alliance. It is very difficult to say exactly why the votes went this way – we will likely understand more in days to come, not just on why Kılıçdaroğlu performed worse than expected but why Erdoğan was able to perform so well above expectations. But what is clear is that Erdoğan now has the advantage for the probable runoff elections on 28 May. His rightwing, ultraconservative alliance has secured a majority in parliament, and voters may shy away from electing a president that will not have the necessary legislative backing. Disappointment and disillusionment on the opposition side may eat into the second Kılıçdaroğlu vote. But those that risk losing even more than they already have are civil society groups, human rights defenders, the Kurds, women and the LGBTQ+ community. It stands to reason that the crackdown on human and cultural rights will intensify if Erdoğan remains president at the helm of an alliance that has already forced Turkey’s exit from the Istanbul convention, the international contract that aims to protect women against gender-based violence and discrimination, with the argument that such a contract “violated Turkey’s family values”. Kingmaker Sinan Oğan – the far-right presidential candidate who has garnered a little more than 5% of the vote – ran on a ticket of anti-Kurdish and anti-immigration sentiment that will heavily shape the coming two weeks and the discourse of both presidential candidates. Thousands of people who have tweeted criticism of Erdoğan and his government in the runup to the elections may find themselves the target of criminal prosecution on charges of having “insulted the president”. More journalists may end up behind bars. Kurdish politicians and human rights defenders jailed on bogus terrorism and conspiracy charges will remain in prison. The already very small space left to civil society will shrink even further. These elections have been framed as a dispute over the future of Turkey, a contest between democracy and autocracy. For those defending rights and justice for everyone in the country, this battle may just have entered its last round.

    <head>John Lewis owner picks Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to replace agency behind hit Christmas ads</head>
    <body>The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has replaced its advertising partner of 14 years with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the agency famous for its 1979 “Labour isn’t working” Conservative party election campaign. The deal ends the relationship with Adam&amp;eveDDB, which created a run of highly successful promotions based on a cosy emotional feel without a hard focus on price and turned John Lewis’s tearjerking Christmas ads into an annual event, with Monty the penguin, Edgar the excitable dragon and Buster the bouncing boxer dog all capturing the nation’s attention. S&amp;S, also known for its Harvey Keitel-fronted Direct Line ads, will now become the lead creative partner for all advertising activity for the John Lewis Partnership (JLP), which owns 34 department stores and dozens of Waitrose supermarkets. Related: What has gone wrong at John Lewis and Waitrose – and can they survive? The agency will take the lead on this year’s Christmas TV campaign and next year’s launch of a joint John Lewis and Waitrose loyalty card as well as promotion of the group’s financial services arm. Charlotte Lock, the customer director at JLP, said: “We’re thrilled to be partnering with the talented team at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in our next stage of growth. As well as sharp strategic thinking and creative excellence, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi’s culture, commitment to inclusion and social impact makes them a great fit for JLP. We’re very excited about what we’ll achieve together.” Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was behind the Conservative party’s ‘Labour Isn’t Working’ advertising campaign in the 1979 general election. Photograph: Chris Ware/Getty Images Franki Goodwin, the chief creative officer at S&amp;S, said: “There’s no bigger need or indeed appetite for advertising than the success of John Lewis Partnership – these brands are important to the fabric of our nation and we can’t wait to get started.” The ad agency change comes as the JLP chair, Sharon White, attempts to lead a turnaround in fortunes for the employee-owned retail group, which has slumped to a loss amid soaring costs and stumbling sales growth since the start of the Covid pandemic. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was responsible for the Direct Line adverts starring Harvey Keitel. Photograph: cityam White has insisted the group is on the right path to profitability but she faced a major rebellion from the group’s staff council last week, when nearly a quarter voted against her continuing as leader and more than 90% voted to chastise her over performance in the past year. As part of her revamp, White is cutting central costs, investing in new avenues including building flats to rent above stores and trying to bring in customers via partnerships with the likes of the takeaway delivery firm Deliveroo and Dobbies garden centres. White has hired the former Hovis boss Nish Kankiwala as the group’s first chief executive, tasking the former private equity supremo who has no direct retail experience with speeding up the pace of change.</body>

    <head>‘It proves he is capable’: the extreme sports offering release for disabled people</head>
    <body>Dieumerci Yanga never recovered from the seizure which, at the age of three, left him in a coma for three weeks. He woke up with significant brain damage, unable to talk or see clearly. But last week, the 27-year-old was to be found working out in his local boxing ring in Rotherham with as much focus and skill as any other beginner. “We’ve tried a range of more gentle sports and none have engaged Dieumerci like boxing has,” said Ghazala Tanveer, Yanga’s support worker. Before he began boxing three months ago, Yanga could only communicate very basic concepts through signs and simple phrases, and experienced acute anxiety when parted from his mother. “He still can’t talk fully but since he starting boxing, he’s not only more independent – happy to go out and about with his mother – but he can communicate so much more clearly that his mum can barely stop crying: she’s able to ‘talk’ with him properly for the first time in his life,” said Tanveer. Yanga is not the only person with complex disabilities to find extreme sports have transformed their lives. Kian Kotecha, from Leicester, is just 19 and has autism, ADHD and epilepsy. Six weeks ago, Kotecha started weekly lessons at his local climbing centre. He is, said his father, a new man. “Kian can already climb walls that would be a challenge for someone who didn’t have disabilities,” said Piyush, his father. “It’s amazing: he struggles to clean his teeth but he can happily climb right to the top of the climbing wall.” Kian Kotecha at the climbing centre in Loughborough. Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The Guardian He added: “Kian has just the same need for adrenaline and excitement as any other young man but life doesn’t often offer those opportunities to those with complex disabilities.” He has tried more traditional sports but it is clear he gets a particular thrill out of climbing, his father said. “He’s so proud of himself: he likes to show everyone the photos of him climbing because it proves that despite his disabilities, he is capable.” Yanga and Kotecha are benefiting from a Sport England grant of £2.2m to Sense, the charity for those with complex disabilities. The money, given across the next four years, means 5,000 disabled people will be able to take part in extreme sports including snow sports, surfing, boxing, ice-skating, goalball and canoeing. “People with complex disabilities are no different to anyone else in the world: they want to have their senses engaged and they want to be thrilled,” said Louis Wickett-Padgham, head of sports and physical activity for Sense. “People with complex disabilities typically live quite static, sedentary lives. “To go from that to a sport that engages all their senses and puts them out of their comfort zones is incredibly exciting. It can feel, sometimes for the first time, that they’re really living their lives.” These moments can, Sense believes, be life-changing – helping them at home, in education, in work and in their social life. “The physicality and freedom of movement that comes with extreme sports is often the first time they’ve had either freedom or ownership of their own movement,” said Wickett-Padgham. “The result is that their motor skills, balance and coordination can leap forward, massively improving their independence.” Lin Wallace at a sensory tennis session in Exeter. Photograph: Mark Sweeney/Owen de Visser Photography Lin Wallace in Devon has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and is blind. She has just taken up sensory tennis, which breaks up the game into smaller chunks of activity like bouncing and catching tennis balls. “I’ve tried other sports but they’re just not exciting: swimming, for example, is just floating around,” she said. “Starting tennis was a huge challenge: I didn’t think I’d be able to do it but I gave it a go and feel I’ve achieved something really extraordinary,” she said. “I’ve started tennis aged 64 – there are a lot of able-bodied 64-year-olds who wouldn’t be able to do that!”</body>

    <head>My dad is ill, but his flat’s ceiling is falling in and our food bill has doubled. There’s no one to help us</head>
    <body>We take things day by day with my dad. After more than 10 years as his full-time carer, I know not to get my hopes up that things will magically get better. At the end of last year, he had some polyps removed from his colon. The surgery helped him to start eating again and gain some weight, something I had been hoping for. I bought him some clothes in bigger sizes for Christmas and now they fit him, which is so good to see. He has his appetite back and can stand long enough in the kitchen to make himself something to eat. Sometimes he’ll even go out for a little walk, which can make you feel as if he is making progress. But then I will arrive the next day and he can’t get out of bed. He tells me he can’t move. He rolls and groans but can’t say what’s wrong. He’s not an old man so there’s clearly something. He used to be so fit: he played football, he had a dog he’d walk for miles, he baked his own bread. Yesterday was one of those bad days so he has another GP appointment tomorrow. This is how we live now – one day at a time without planning or hoping, or looking too far into the future. February and March were particularly rough. With Christmas and New Year over, the days were dark, quiet and cold. Even now, he is still living in thermals and sleeping under extra duvets. He has no central heating in his flat. I’ve been trying to get him into new accommodation, somewhere warm and dry, where the ceiling isn’t caving in because of the damp. Somewhere safe; there’s always screaming and shouting where he lives and I’ve turned up to find police tape cordoning off his building. Finding something suitable has been a nightmare. I’m an educated person and even I am stumped by the endless bureaucracy. I will think I have put him on a waiting list but when I try to follow up – what are his options? How long will the wait be? – I just get an automated email or a leaflet in the post that doesn’t answer any of my questions. Every government website seems impossible to navigate and I think it’s deliberate. There’s usually no phone number, no email address. My laptop and phone are both really old models and there’s no way I can afford new devices or updates or technical help. I often wonder if my technology just isn’t compatible with the right systems. I can’t be the only one. Related: In my freezing house, gripped by fear, I scrawl ‘things can get better’ on a chalkboard | Marin I do the shopping for us. The cost is easily two-and-a-half times what it was last year. The only reason I’m managing OK is because I’ve been getting vouchers from the food bank. I look after my dad in the daytime and I don’t go out much in the evening – it’s unaffordable – so I stay in, read, watch TV. I’m endlessly angry about our situation so I try not to engage too much with the news. Instead, I get my news from lefty comedians – that way it at least comes with a laugh. My dad has a dark sense of humour, too, and a wicked accent – old school, deep Midlands. No one young talks like that any more. Spending so much time together isn’t always easy, but we still manage to laugh. My hope for the summer is a new home for him in a ground-floor flat somewhere safe and comfortable, where he can start building his strength. He wants a dog when he’s able to walk one – he’s always had dogs in the past – and who knows, maybe it will be possible. If all that happens, we’ll be doing all right. As told to Anna Moore.

    <head>One can of chickpeas, two recipes: Nancy Birtwhistle’s budget midweek meal</head>
    <body>This colourful, satisfying soup is great for those wanting to cut down on their meat intake, and ticks the gluten- and dairy-free boxes, too. It can be cooked on the hob, or in the oven, slow cooker or pressure cooker. Save the liquid from the tin of chickpeas and whip it up into a deliciously light chocolate mousse for afters. Chunky soup Save all of the vegetable peelings and trimmings, and use them to make the flavourful stock. Prep 15 min Soak 12 hr Cook 1 hr 30 min+ (depending on cooking method) Serves 4-6 1-2 tbsp vegetable oil 2 onions, peeled and chopped small 2-3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped 1 stick celery, chopped 1 tbsp mixed dried herbs, or 2 tbsp chopped fresh herbs Salt and black pepper 800g mixed vegetables (eg carrots, sweet potato, leeks, potatoes), all cut into 2cm dice ½ tsp chilli powder, or 1 tsp hot chilli sauce or 1 medium fresh chilli (green or red), finely chopped 100g dried lentils, beans and/or pulses (puy lentils, red lentils, green lentils, yellow split peas, green split peas), soaked in 300ml cold water for 12 hours, then drained 1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained and liquid reserved for the chocolate mousse below 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes, or passata 800ml vegetable stock (see method) 185g frozen peas First, make the stock. Put all the vegetable peelings and trimmings, including the onion skins, any parsley stalks and the garlic skins, in a large, microwave-proof bowl, pour on 800ml boiling water, cover, microwave for 10 minutes on high, then set aside. In a large pan, pressure cooker or ovenproof casserole, heat the oil, then fry the onion and garlic on a low heat for five to 10 minutes, until they start to soften. Stir in the celery and herbs, a hefty pinch each of salt and pepper, and cook for a few minutes, to soften. Add all the diced mixed vegetables, turn the heat to high and fry, stirring regularly, until they start to catch and colour at the edges. Add the chilli and the drained lentils and chickpeas, then stir in the tomatoes and stock. To cook in the oven, cover with a well-fitting lid and bake at 220C (200C fan)/475F/gas 9 for about an hour, or until the vegetables are tender and the pulses have absorbed much of the liquid and thickened the soup. If using a slow cooker, cook for five to six hours, until the vegetables are tender and the soup has thickened; for a pressure cooker, cook on high for 20 minutes; on the hob, bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer, cover and cook for 40-50 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary, then stir through the peas until cooked, and serve in warmed bowls. Chocolate mousse Nancy Birtwhistle’s chocolate mousse.

    <head>‘Gone, but still here’: how vanished flight MH370 is reflected in a father’s dementia</head>
    <body>On 8 March 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur airport. Somewhere over the Indian Ocean the plane, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, vanished from air traffic radar. Though the subsequent search was the biggest in aviation history, the mystery of what happened to the passengers and crew has never been solved. The families have been left in a state of uncertainty, their questions unanswered. All Right. Good Night. – initially reported to be the final message from the pilot of the missing jet – is a show by Helgard Haug of German theatre innovators Rimini Protokoll. It weaves together the story of the disappearance of flight MH370 and the stasis in which it left the families, with a personal account of her father’s gradual decline from dementia and the way someone can vanish from our lives even while remaining physically present. The show, which premiered in Germany in 2021 (where it was awarded best show of the year by German theatre critics), knits together projected text with a score composed by German musician Barbara Morgenstern, performed live by the Zafraan Ensemble. It is neither a concert nor a performance, but “something in between,” says Haug. “The text has a very clear, insistent rhythm that we tied together with the music,” she says. The musicians perform behind a transparent curtain and images of waves are projected on the back wall. Morgenstern, who previously collaborated on the Rimini Protokoll show Chinchilla Arsehole, Eyey, a piece about Tourette syndrome, is predominantly an electro-pop musician so she faced the challenge of working with a chamber orchestra. Haug’s text captures moments of lucidity and distress, hope and hopelessness. Both of the show’s scenarios, she says, are in some senses anti-dramatic. “We know the end of both stories from the start,” she says. The piece is more about “the attempts to adjust to a situation”. The musicians play surrounded by sand, as if on a beach. It is at once soothing and ominous. “People always long to go to the sea, but it can be frightening,” she says – this vast, potentially deadly expanse of water. “Every scene has a new kind of setting,” Haug explains, but as soon as the setting is established, nothing else happens. “It’s more like a tableau.” A woman writes messages for the passengers of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in 2016 in Kuala Lumpur, on the second anniversary of the plane’s disappearance. Photograph: Fazry Ismail/EPA Haug had become increasingly interested in the idea of absence. She conducted research into missing people. “I went down a lot of rabbit holes,” she says. Gradually she focused on the story of MH370 and on her father, and everything else fell away. These two narratives interweave in poignant ways. Talk of drift analysis merges with descriptions of her father’s handwriting, which grows jagged on the page. His conversation turns in circles just as the plane is thought to have circled over the ocean. “You are gone, but also still here,” the text says. There are, however, moments of humour too, something that was true to Haug’s experience with her father. The show started with “an enormous pile of text”, she says, but then, gradually, they whittled it down and “the music took over”. There’s something fitting in this. Often with people with dementia, when memories fade away, music remains. “Memories are often triggered by music,” she explains. “People may not know their name any more, but they can sing along to a song they remember from their childhood.” Haug was very conscious of the fact that, for the families of the passengers, their grief isongoing; they have no closure. She did not want to expose them. The use of unspoken text is, in some senses, protective. The audience reads it in their own voice. They hear it in their heads. Haug also had to ask herself and her family whether they were comfortable sharing her father’s experience on stage in this way. He was a public figure, she reasons, an intellectual, and in his later years, he spent a lot of time thinking about what would make the perfect flat for someone living with dementia. “He was very aware that it might happen to him,” she said. “The older you get, the higher the risk that you will suffer from this.” Perhaps, she suggests, he even had some sense this was happening to him, before anyone else noticed. “He had very clear opinions about how he wanted people to deal with him when he grew confused and was no longer able to speak for himself,” she says. In the end, she realised, “I felt that I could do this, and maybe I should do this”. After all, the statistical likelihood of experiencing dementia within our families is high, even if it is something people don’t often want to acknowledge or discuss. The show is a way of placing these issues “on the table”, says Haug, and though it is personal to her, “it has resonated with a lot of people”. All Right. Good Night. is at Home, Manchester, 6-8 July, as part of Manchester international festival</body>

    <head>‘We are a forgotten people’: how rap music processed trauma in Iraq</head>
    <body>The 2003 invasion of Iraq left a small but noticeable impression on US hip-hop. “Stomp, push, shove, mosh, fuck Bush / Until they bring our troops home,” as Eminem rapped on Mosh, and he begged: “No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil,” alongside a bitingly direct video. “We rebellious … screaming ‘leave Iraq alone!’” Jay-Z rapped in 2003, and a year after the invasion, MF Doom questioned what the point of it all was on the Madvillain track Strange Ways: “All you get is lost children / While the bosses sit up behind the desks, it cost billions / To blast humans in half, into calves and arms / Only one side is allowed to have bombs.” But the rap scene in Iraq hadn’t taken off in the same way it has now – Iraqi musicians such as the hugely popular Kadim al Saher continued to produce music influenced by the usual choubi and chalgi folk and pop styles – and so these relatively infrequent interjections from US rappers came to dominate the conversation around the war. In the 20 years since, though, rappers in Iraq and its diaspora have voiced their lived experience of the conflict and their reflections on its legacy, often striking a noticeably different tone to how the conflict was documented in western rap. An entire generation born after the invasion lived with the aftershocks of war, which are ongoing, and this jyl il jdeed (new generation) didn’t share their parents’ sentimentality for the country’s bygone era (expressed in Iraqi “heyday” songs such as Seta Hagopian’s Droub El Safar and Nadhim Al Ghazali’s Fouq il Nakhal). Instead, they provocatively utilised the tools of a genre, rap, that had originated from the country responsible for their nation’s predicament. That irony is one reason why satire reigns in Iraqi rap today. Perhaps the most potent example of this is I-NZ’s This Is Iraq, a version of US rapper Childish Gambino’s This Is America – both of them commentaries on their respective countries’ corruption. The young Iraqi cites Iranian-backed militias (“Corruptin’ the area / Farsi hysteria”), assassinations and censorship (“I might get shot for this / you might get blocked from this”) and, of course, a reference to Bush’s 2003 invasion and oil extraction: “Food for barrels and barrels.” He also notes that irony of using the culture of his oppressor: “The US taught me.” Aged 23, rapper Hussein Khalifa AKA Khalifa OG is Iraq’s most popular rapper – the Baghdadi’s 2022 song Tapsy has 16m views and cleverly uses a traditional zanbour drum sound heard in traditional Iraqi choubi music alongside a western hip-hop beat. Khalifa, like I-NZ, enjoys poking fun at the hypocrisy of Iraqi leadership, rapping on Tapsy: “This is a democratic country and we have freedom to express, but don’t you speak about them, my brother, of course that’s not allowed” (in Arabic, this has a more biting tone). Last year, he told the National that using playful satire was a way of helping Iraqis process and move past the war. “As Iraqi people, we are upset and depressed all the time,” he said. “We don’t want to listen to sad things about our reality … I try to talk about our problems in a fun way. We cannot keep pestering about the issues. We have to keep it fun. Why else are we living if not?” But other rappers favour direct storytelling, and relay war trauma with solemnity. “My fate was in the hands of the American soldiers as our streets became dangerous,” raps Vife as he tells an Iraqi story in Qusat Iraqi: “Dead bodies like flower pots / In each corner you’ll find hundreds / Red blood coloured the streets / and we became the victims.” Despite the heaviness of the lyrics dictating the reality of Iraqis since 2003, the track ends with a call to resistance and hope: “My life would be pointless if I let my situation dictate my future … I’ll continue, and I’ll not give up on my rights.” Outside Iraq, rappers with Iraqi heritage have long been processing the war and while they’re vocal about the situation in contemporary Iraq, their most powerful lyrics focus on the marginalisation they face in the west. The most notable is Narcy Narce, AKA Yassin Alsalman. The Canadian-Iraqi rapper, who is also a professor at Montreal’s University of Concordia and teaches courses on Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, tells me he uses rap for its “potential [to be] both expressive and educational – a person can really find their inner voice and bring it out and then manifest the reality they wish for.” On tracks like his classic Makoo, he pushes back against Islamophobia through both lyrics and production – sampling a recording of the iconic Souad Abdullah’s choubi track where she claims “there is no one better than us”, Narcy raps: “I’m afraid that if you hate it then you probably fear us.” In the video we see “Fuck Mohamed, return to Iraq” written on a Quebec wall, and Narcy’s vocals then emulate the Muslim call to prayer: a pointed rebuttal. There’s also that Iraqi flair for humour: “Fear, fire, famine / nothing much has changed since the 90s, except maybe the haircuts,” says actor Fajer Al-Kaisi in the introduction of Narcy’s Love Me (Hate Me), a reminder of the still-reverberating effects of the 1991 Gulf war, America’s first invasion of Iraq – and a poke at today’s famously outrageous Iraqi male hairstyles. Growing up in Quebec, Narcy and his family were labelled as the enemy; he felt others could only perceive him through the lens of the war, which inspired defensiveness and “brought Iraq to the forefront of my identity”, he says. “We are a forgotten people – a people who injustice and war labelled as downtrodden, but I knew how old and rich our cultural heritage is.” That drive inspired him to tell Iraqi stories from a place of positivity, highlighting the historical significance of Iraq to the world, and to use hip-hop, long an anti-establishment mouthpiece and the perfect medium to castigate what Narcy calls “20 years of puppeteering and violence”. For Narcy, a complete processing of the war can only be accomplished through justice, which Iraqis are yet to receive and not ever likely to. So for Iraqi artists to use the tools of hip-hop to speak the truth of their oppression by “the same colonial system that oppressed Black and brown people in America is only natural”, says Narcy. ‘It’s not about pity’ … Lowkey. Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty Images The sense of unity between oppressed peoples also distinguishes the music of London-based activist and rapper Lowkey, AKA Kareem Dennis. In Iraq2Chile, like Narcy, Lowkey uses rap to educate listeners about Iraqi realities (“It’s not about pity, handouts or sympathy / It’s about employment, water and electricity”) and draws links between neoliberal US intervention in Iraq and Chile: “Selling state assets for private interests is real treason.” Ghosts of Grenfell hymns those who died in the Grenfell tower fire, most of whom were ethnic minorities from the Wana region, and several of them Iraqi. The Iraqi rap scene continues to respond to the war and challenge the corruption which settled in the country’s leadership since the invasion, but it’s also evolving to celebrate Iraqi joy and culture beyond conflict. The established Saudi producer Big Hass recently brought together nine domestic and diaspora Iraqi rappers, such as Odd Khalid and Nayomi, for the Iraq Cypher freestyle track which racked up half a million views on YouTube, rapping about everything from immigrant-parent struggle to double-meaning wordplay. Sweden-based Nayomi is also diversifying a male-dominated scene, referencing her Iraqi culture by using the oud in her track OMG. A new era of bravery and playfulness among young musicians means that Iraq is “finally finding its voice on the ground”, Narcy argues, refashioning an Iraqi identity on their own terms: “It’s time for our brothers and sisters to shine.”</body>

    <head>BBC Westwood inquiry chief says it has received ‘significant’ new information</head>
    <body>A BBC inquiry into what the corporation knew about allegations of sexual misconduct against the DJ Tim Westwood has received “significant” new information. It comes after the independent review team, led by Gemma White KC, opened a confidential phone line in an attempt to “expand the ways in which people can come forward” to report information. White announced on Monday that the phone line would close as planned on 19 May and the inquiry had received a “significant amount of important new information”. Last year, a joint investigation by the Guardian and BBC News published allegations of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour made by several women against Westwood. The presenter, who denied the allegations, subsequently stepped down from his show on Capital Xtra. The BBC appointed White last August after an internal review found that the corporation may have missed chances to explore concerns raised against Westwood, who was a DJ at BBC Radio 1 from 1994 to 2013. Jahnine Davis, one of the UK’s leading specialists in the safeguarding of Black children, was appointed to help with the review. The inquiry, which has reportedly already seen more than 50,000 BBC documents, is expected to publish its findings in the summer. Giving an update on Monday, White said: “We would like to thank everyone who has contacted us via the review phone line. We know that taking the decision to call was not easy for many of you and that speaking to us has taken courage. “Your evidence will assist me in my task of independently establishing whether the BBC knew of concerns and responded appropriately to them. If you have been thinking of contributing but have not been sure about whether to do so, please do get in touch now.” Westwood has denied all the allegations, with a spokesperson saying they were “completely false” and that there had never been any complaints against him “officially or unofficially”. The hotline is available on 08000 121 838 until 19 May.</body>

    <head>The big idea: why we need a new definition of junk food</head>
    <body>Strange as it may seem, food has replaced tobacco as the leading cause of early death globally. Each year, more people die in America from illnesses caused by poor diet than were killed fighting in every war in US history combined. In the UK the situation is equally dire. Officially, the health effects of food are entirely due to its nutritional content – the amount of fat, salt, sugar and fibre it contains. The current system leaves it up to you to read the detailed information on the pack and decide how much to eat based on recommended values, and if you have children you’ll need to know the values for them too. This is nigh-on impossible for most people – but even if you were able to calculate exactly how much fat, salt and sugar you were consuming in each mouthful, you would still be neglecting one vital determinant of health – how the food was processed. You might feel like you’ve heard all this before. People have expressed concern about “processed food” for a long time, but it’s not always been an easy concept to pin down. After all, we have been processing food for hundreds of thousands of years. The human diet was invented by primarily female domestic scientists who modified plants and animals by milling, shaking, pounding and grinding them, or altering them via fermentation and heat, before salting, smoking and drying them for preservation. Food processing has shaped almost every aspect of our bodies: we have the shortest guts of any animal our size because part of their job is outsourced to our kitchens. We are the only animal that must process its food to survive. Processing is fine. But just over a decade ago a team of scientists in Brazil noticed a paradox in the data from their national nutrition surveys. Obesity had gone from being rare, to being the country’s dominant public health problem – even though people were buying less oil and sugar. What they were eating more of was industrially processed food: biscuits, emulsified breads, confectionary and so on. The team developed a definition that distinguished between traditional food, whole or processed, and these items, which they termed ultra processed foods, or UPFs for short. The full definition is pages long because it needs to encompass so many different products. But if you’re trying to work out if something is a UPF, a good rule of thumb is that it’ll be wrapped in plastic and contain an ingredient you don’t find in a domestic kitchen. The Brazilian team’s work meant that the hypothesis – that UPFs were themselves the cause of health problems – could be tested. There are now hundreds of robust scientific studies which show that higher UPF intake is associated with weight gain, stroke, heart attack, cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, depression, dementia and early death. In the UK we get around 60% of our calories from UPFs, and that figure is even higher for young people. At this point, it is our national food culture, and the material we build our children’s bodies from. Much of it is familiar as “junk food”, but our traditional idea of what constitutes that – chips, crisps, fizzy drinks – needs adjusting. It should include all supermarket bread; likewise breakfast cereal; packaged snacks, reconstituted meat products and frozen meals. And beware: lots of UPFs are being marketed as healthy, nutritious or useful for weight loss. The evidence now shows that UPFs are harmful not simply because they are salty, fatty, sugary and low in fibre; the processing itself is at fault. Read the ingredients list and you’ll see that most UPFs are made from commodity crops such as corn or soy deconstructed into their most basic molecules (protein isolates, refined oils and modified carbohydrates). These are then reassembled with additives to produce food in any shape or texture desired. This manipulation of texture is a big part of the problem. UPFs are often very soft and very dry. The illusions of moisture is created with gums and oils, but the water content is low in order to improve shelf life. As a result these foods are extremely energy dense. High energy density combined with softness means you eat quickly, and bodily systems evolved over millions of years to tell you when you’re full can’t keep up. There is a very long list of other possible explanations for the damage UPFs cause. For example, fruits and vegetables are complex, containing tens of thousands of phytochemicals – molecules which are essential for dietary health. UPFs have dramatically reduced levels of these. And many of the additives used (such as emulsifiers, flavour enhancers and sweeteners) have direct undesirable effects on our metabolic health and our microbiomes. All this is scientifically fascinating, but trying to dissect exactly how UPFs harm us, though important, may be less useful from a public health perspective than taking a step back and asking why we have them in the first place. The culinary scientists of pre-history invented food for the nourishment of their families and communities. Ultra-processed food is part of a financialised food system whose purpose is profit. For example, it incentivises squeezing every last sellable ingredient out of things that aren’t even grown for human consumption: soy protein isolate, corn syrup and modified starches all come from crops farmed at vast scale to feed animals. Products go through cycles of development and marketing over many decades, incorporating more and more processes and ingredients, all with the aim of making it hard to stop eating them. The evidence shows that for many people, myself included, some UPFs are as addictive as cigarettes and other drugs of abuse. It’s not surprising that food developed by transnational corporations motivated by shareholder value affects our physiology differently from food cooked by someone who loves us, but it’s taken us a long time to be certain of it; among independent scientists at leading institutions like UCL, where I work, there is a growing consensus that ultra-processing is a significant driver of the poor health that causes so much suffering in this country. So, what should we do? We need to put a warning about ultra processed food in our national nutrition guidance, the NHS Eatwell Guide, alongside those that mention salt, fat and sugar. This seems like a small step but it’s vital. From there we must tread carefully. For many people UPFs are the only affordable food available, and policy changes should avoid further stigmatising the disadvantaged groups most vulnerable to their effects. One win-win measure would be to limit the marketing of these products, especially to children. And we should make sure everything served in institutions like schools, hospitals and prisons is real food. Eventually we’ll need to recognise, as with tobacco products, that warning labels are necessary. And there are broader lessons here too: we know that when people can afford to eat more healthily, they do. Reducing the weight gain, diabetes and heart attacks caused by UPFs means reducing the poverty and inequality that make them the only option for so many. • Ultra-Processed People by Chris van Tulleken is published by Cornerstone.

    <head>Charities call for scrapping of VAT on sunscreen amid skin cancer fears</head>
    <body>The high cost of sunscreen is resulting in more skin cancer cases, according to charities who are calling on the UK government to scrap VAT on protective creams. Melanoma skin cancer is on the rise and 4,000 cases annually are linked to poverty, according to the Melanoma Focus charity, which argues that a VAT cut would reduce the number of deaths. Susanna Daniels, the chief executive of Melanoma Focus, said: “The government could help make skin protection more accessible to all, regardless of income level, by removing VAT from high-factor sunscreens. This would be a cost-effective way to cut the overall incidence of skin cancer and could help save lives.” The move would bring the UK closer to Australia, where sunscreen is subsidised. Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK and the deadliest form of skin cancer – yet 86% of melanomas are preventable. Melanoma Focus surveyed 2,003 adults, and found that half thought sunscreen was too expensive, while 10% said they did not use it because of the cost and two-thirds (67%) said they would use more if it were 20% cheaper. The survey also said most people (58%) did not know the signs of melanoma skin cancer, which include a mole that has changed shape, or colour, or looks and feels unusual, as well as skin with a sore that does not heal within four weeks, or has visible lumps, or hurts, itches, bleeds or scabs. There are about 2,300 melanoma skin cancer deaths in the UK every year, which the number projected to rise. Cancer Research UK has forecast there could be about 26,500 new cases of melanoma skin cancer every year in the UK by 2038, up from 16,700. One in 36 men and one in 47 women in the UK will be diagnosed in their lifetime. Michelle Richardson, 49, from Hampshire, was diagnosed with melanoma in 2018 after spotting an itchy mole on her back, which was then removed. She had 18 months of clear scans, then felt a lump on her pelvis. “By the next day I had seven lumps and within a week I was no longer able to eat or walk and breathing was very difficult. A scan found the melanoma had spread throughout my body including in my spine, lungs, spleen and brain. I had stage 4 incurable melanoma and my life as I knew it changed forever,” she said. “I was utterly terrified and felt so guilty about the thought of leaving my 10-year-old daughter without a mum. I had immunotherapy treatment for two years and I’m currently in remission and hope it stays that way for as long as possible.” Amy Callaghan, the MP for East Dunbartonshire and former member of the health and social care committee, backed the call to remove VAT from sunscreen. “When 52% of people in my constituency can’t afford to turn on the heating, it’s unlikely they’ll take on extra expenses like sunscreen,” she said. Cancer Research UK’s senior health information manager, Dr Claire Knight, added that the cheapest way to protect yourself was to stay in the shade and cover up. She said: “It’s worth remembering that you don’t need to spend a lot on a sunscreen to get good protection – what matters is an SPF of at least 15, and a star rating of 4 or 5.” Dr Louise Soanes, the chief nurse at the Teenage Cancer Trust, said few people realised that getting painful sunburn just once every two years could triple the risk of skin cancer, and that melanoma was the most common skin cancer in young people in the UK, with the number of cases rising. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “We recognise the impact that rising prices are having at home which is why we are providing significant support worth on average £3,300 per household. This includes holding down energy bills, uplifting benefits and delivering direct cash payments. “High-factor sunscreen is on the NHS prescription list for certain conditions and is already provided VAT-free when dispensed by a pharmacist to these patients.”</body>

    <head>‘Impossible to hold him accountable’: DeSantis signs laws to ease 2024 run</head>
    <body>Ron DeSantis is using the final weeks before he reportedly launches a presidential campaign to modify Florida law to allow him to run while serving as governor and reduce transparency over political spending and his travel. DeSantis is poised to sign a bill that would exempt him from Florida’s “resign-to-run” law, so that he won’t have to give up his office in order to run for president. Under existing state law, if he were to run, DeSantis would have had to submit a resignation letter before Florida’s qualifying deadline this year and step down by inauguration day in 2025. Last month, Republicans in the state legislature passed a measure that says the restriction does not apply to those running for president or vice-president. The bill also imposes sweeping new voting restrictions in the state and will make it much harder for non-profits to do voter registration drives. “I can’t think of a better training ground than the state of Florida for a future potential commander-in-chief,” Tyler Sirois, a Republican state lawmaker, said when the bill was being debated. Some Democrats questioned why lawmakers would allow DeSantis to take his attention away from being governor. “Why are we signing off on allowing Ron DeSantis the ability to not do his job?” Angie Nixon, a legislator from Jacksonville, said last month. Related: DeSantis signs bills banning Chinese citizens from buying land in Florida DeSantis also signed a bill last week that will shield records related to his travel from public view. The new law exempts all of DeSantis’s past and future travel from disclosure under Florida’s public records law, one of the most transparent in the US. It also exempts the state from having to disclose the names of people who meet with the governor at his office or mansion or travel with him, said Barbara Petersen, the executive director of the Florida Center for Government Accountability, who has worked on transparency laws for more than three decades in the state. Republican lawmakers and DeSantis have cited security concerns to justify the law. But Democrats and transparency advocates have said it is a brazen effort to keep DeSantis’s travel secret. “It’s un-fricking-believable,” Petersen said. “It will be virtually impossible to hold this governor accountable without access to those kinds of records.” The security rationale for the bill was “bogus”, she said. “They’re not going to let somebody in the mansion if they don’t know who that person is. I don’t understand why it’s a security concern of where he went six weeks ago. “Where a governor goes, who travels with the governor, who the governor meets with is all information of critical importance to the public. Who is influencing the governor? We need to know that.” The same bill that repeals the resign-to-run requirement would make it harder to know where political committees in Florida, including DeSantis’s, are raising money from. Currently, statewide political committees are required to file monthly campaign finance reports for much of a campaign. Under the new measure, those committees would only have to file quarterly reports until the state’s qualification deadline, when they would have to file more regular reports. “It’s definitely a step backwards for transparency in campaign finance,” said Ben Wilcox, the co-founder of Integrity Florida, a government watchdog group. “It’s just gonna slow down the reporting of what these political committees are raising. “They are raising boatloads of money. The political committees are the preferred fundraising tool out there,” he added. DeSantis recently moved to distance himself from his Florida political committee, which has about $86m, according to Politico. The move prompted speculation that the committee might attempt to transfer money to a federal super Pac backing his presidential bid, Politico reported. Such a transfer may be legally questionable and would only be possible if DeSantis were unaffiliated with the Florida political committee. “It looks like they’re laying the groundwork to transfer the money to some sort of vehicle that would support his presidential run,” said Stephen Spaulding, a campaign finance expert at Common Cause, a government watchdog group. “What that, again, goes to show is how loose the coordination rules are, how they need to be strengthened, and how existing rules need to be enforced.”</body>

    <head>We don’t know if jury-less trials will convict more rapists, but don’t shut down the debate</head>
    <body>Back in February, one of the reasons I gave for my decision to stand down as first minister was a concern about the part I might be playing, however unwittingly, in the polarisation of our politics. Polarised, often highly toxic, public discourse is not a uniquely Scottish phenomenon. And by no stretch of the imagination was I the sole or even primary cause of it in Scotland. But I had come to feel that the duration of my time in the trenches of frontline politics was making it harder for me to broker the common ground necessary to advance difficult or controversial policy changes. It is now almost two months since I left office and while that period hasn’t unfolded exactly as I anticipated – for reasons I won’t go into here – it has given me a different perspective. The benefits of the rear-view mirror (I am also learning to drive!) are considerable. On the issue of polarisation, I think that, if anything, I underestimated the depth of the problem. That people have strong opinions and express them vehemently is to be celebrated. Give me passion over apathy any day of the week. But it is depressingly striking in today’s politics just how quickly people adopt fixed and immovable positions. I am not breaking news with this observation – but being more removed from the cut and thrust has made it so much starker to me. Related: Sturgeon calls for both sides to ‘take a breath’ in rape trial reform row The reaction to the proposed pilot of judge-only rape trials in Scotland, part of a package of measures to improve access to justice for victims of this appalling crime, is a case in point. Before going further, full disclosure. I was first minister when the cabinet signed off the victims, witnesses and justice reform (Scotland) bill that includes this proposal. I support it. However, I also recognise that the arguments for and against are finely balanced – as is often the case with legislation seeking to tackle deep-seated problems. Indeed, that is why the proposal is for a time-limited pilot only – to test whether or not judge-only trials could help address the deficit of justice in rape cases without compromising the right to a fair trial of those accused. There has always been a recognition that the principle and detail of this proposal need serious consideration. But before the ink was even dry on the draft legislation and without a single word of debate or evidence being heard in parliament, let alone the shape of the final proposal being known, fixed positions had been staked. I am not expecting, or even trying, to change minds with this article – but I am expressing a hope that it is not too late for us all to take a breath. This issue matters. It should be beyond party politics. And it should not be beyond our body politic to approach it differently. First, we should accept there are valid points on both sides and allow some good faith to enter the debate. Contrary to what has been suggested, it is not a politician-inspired plan to undermine the justice system. In fact, the proposal is based on a recommendation from Lady Dorrian, Scotland’s second most senior judge. And it seeks to address a genuine issue. In Scotland in 2020-21, of the 2,176 rapes or attempted rapes reported to police, only 152 gave rise to a prosecution. And of these, only 78 resulted in a conviction – a conviction rate for rape and attempted rape of just 51%, compared with 91% for offences overall. The reasons are complex. But the impact of so-called “rape myths” can’t be ignored. We know what these are: that a woman who was dressed a particular way, or had been drinking, or in a relationship with her alleged attacker, must be at least partly to blame; that sex can only be rape if physical force is used – anything less implies consent; or that a woman who doesn’t immediately report a rape to the police must be making it up. It is uncomfortable to acknowledge that such views still exist in a modern society, but they do. And if they are still prevalent in society, is it credible to think they will never be present in the jury room? There is a strong case for change. But the counter-arguments are far from frivolous. It has long been accepted that for the most serious crimes, the sacrosanct right to a fair trial means trial before a jury of peers. Judges may be just as vulnerable to “rape myths” as juries – and as there is only one of them rather than a whole panel of jurors with mixed views, the impact may be greater. Even if this proposal did help solve the problem, would it be at the expense of the fundamental rights of those accused of crime? And is a pilot that involves scrutiny of conviction rates consistent with the independence of the judiciary? All these points, for and against, must be considered and addressed. We should proceed on the strength of evidence and reasoned argument and, where necessary, make amendments to the bill as it stands. It is surely at the end of that process – not before it has even started – that a judgment should be made on whether or not it is possible to design a pilot that might help tackle the denial of justice for many rape victims, without compromising the rights of those accused of such crimes. I hope we may yet proceed on that basis. It will require the government, as well as critics of the bill, to be prepared to keep an open mind. To that end, I was heartened to hear the justice secretary talk of the need for “sober and serious debate and scrutiny”. She has said her door is open and should be taken at her word. Related: Abusers are using a sinister new route to silence their accusers. This is how we fought back – and won | Tamsin Allen As the backbencher that I now am – albeit one who supports the bill – I am open to discussion on all aspects of it (it proposes much more than judge-only trials), and to supporting or tabling amendments that help allay concerns. Above all, given the deeply serious issues the bill seeks to address, it would be good to think we might take the opportunity it offers to demonstrate that the descent into a polarised and therefore paralysed politics is not as inevitable as it seems.

    <head>Sturgeon calls for both sides to ‘take a breath’ in rape trial reform row</head>
    <body>Nicola Sturgeon says the furious backlash to Scottish government plans to pilot jury-less trials for rape cases is the latest example of the polarisation of politics that contributed to her resignation as first minister. The proposal, part of a wide-ranging justice reform bill introduced by her successor, Humza Yousaf, aims to tackle endemic low conviction rates for rape prosecution, and would make Scotland the first part of the UK to use specialist courts and judge-only trials for serious sexual assaults. Related: We don’t know if jury-less trials will convict more rapists, but don’t shut down the debate But it has already attracted condemnation from the highest levels of the legal profession across the UK, with lawyers’ associations throughout Scotland balloting to join a near unanimous boycott of the scheme. In her first policy intervention since she stood down as first minister, Sturgeon calls on those in the legal profession who immediately opposed the idea as well as supportive MSPs like herself to “take a breath”. “This issue matters. It should be beyond party politics. And it should not be beyond our body politic to approach it differently.” Writing in the Guardian, Sturgeon also acknowledges that the period since she left office “hasn’t unfolded exactly as I anticipated”, a reference to the continuing police investigation in her party’s finances, which involved the “nightmare” arrest of her husband, the former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, and the forensic search of their home. She does not directly address any of the unanswered questions surrounding Operation Branchform, investigating allegations the party had mishandled more than £600,000 in donations, though she has repeatedly insisted that it had nothing to do with her resignation in February and expressed frustration that “I’m not able to give my version of what is under way”. After both Murrell and the former SNP treasurer Colin Beattie were arrested and released without charge pending further investigations, speculation continues about whether Sturgeon will herself be arrested or otherwise interviewed by officers. In recent weeks, allies including the SNP’s former director of communications Murray Foote have challenged the police investigation, with Foote insisting he does not believe it will result in any charges and describing the pitching of forensic tents outside the former first minister’s home as a “grotesque circus”. Regardless of the outcome of the police investigation, anger among party members towards Sturgeon at the emerging lack of governance and transparency under her leadership remains palpable, and has left Yousaf facing a clamour for internal reform. Her intervention in the row over judge-led rape trials comes a day after the former supreme court judge Lord Hope told the Sunday Times the plans risk undermining “the most basic principle of judicial independence”, while earlier this month Lord Uist accused politicians of “treating the courts as forensic laboratories in which to experiment with their policies”. Sturgeon points out that the pilot was recommended by Scotland’s second most senior judge, Lady Dorrian, rather than “a politician-inspired plan to undermine the justice system”. The proposals, which form part of a suite of radical measures set out by Yousaf and the justice minister, Angela Constance, last month, including the abolition of the controversial Scottish verdict of “not proven”, were welcomed as “transformative” by campaigners and survivors of sexual assault. Noting that she was still first minister when the cabinet signed off the victims, witnesses and justice reform (Scotland) bill, Sturgeon says “there has always been a recognition that the principle and detail of this proposal need serious consideration” and states her willingness to table amendments as a backbencher that help allay concerns. “It is surely at the end of that process – not before it has even started – that a judgment should be made on whether or not it is possible to design a pilot that might help tackle the denial of justice for many rape victims, without compromising the rights of those accused of such crimes.”</body>

    <head>Awkward? Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby ignore reports of rift on This Morning</head>
    <body>Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, the co-hosts of ITV’s flagship daytime TV programme, chose to ignore headlines about their off-air feud as they tried to present a cosy front on the studio sofa. Following days of front page headlines about reports of their strained relationship, Monday’s show opened with a review of the papers that avoided the subject altogether. The front page of the Sun had declared that “Furious Phil calls in lawyers” and other newspapers ran prominent stories about what they said were “crisis talks” between the pair and ITV. But Schofield, Willoughby and their guests, Gyles Brandreth and Camilla Tominey, spoke only about other stories including Eurovision, potential space travel to Australia, working from home, and Brandreth’s jumper. It was the pair’s first appearance together on This Morning since Schofield alluded to a strain in their relationship. There had been doubts about whether one or both of the presenters would appear on the show this week. Instead they opted to try to present a united front with no reference to the reported rift. But viewers claimed they picked up on the awkward chemistry between the pair. The show began with Disney composer Alan Menken playing a medley on a piano. Willoughby said: “Oh, that was so nice.” Schofield added: “What a way to start your Monday this morning.” Turning to Willoughby, he said: “That is right up our street.” His co-star agreed: “Right up my street. It’s just a little taste of what we’ve got coming up later ahead of the release of The Little Mermaid. “Award-winning Disney composer Alan Menken will be performing a medley of some of his best-known songs and I’m going to try really hard not to sing along. You might have to gag me.” Schofield joked: “This could be your audition. This could be your big moment.” Related: Phillip Schofield: how the TV presenter gave a fresh spin to Putin’s propaganda Last Thursday, Schofield told the Sun that “Holly is my rock”. But in a statement that was reportedly not cleared by his co-presenter he added: “The last few weeks haven’t been easy for either of us.” The pair’s relationship is reported to have begun to fray last September after they were criticised over claims they skipped the queue for Queen Elizabeth II’s lying in state. Schofield took a planned break from the show during the trial of his younger brother Timothy Schofield on child sexual abuse charges at Exeter crown court last month. Timothy Schofield is due to be sentenced later this week after being found guilty on 11 offences against a teenage boy. Willoughby also recently pulled out of presenting the show after reportedly suffering from shingles. The pair, who also present ITV’s Dancing on Ice, have been co-presenting This Morning for 14 years.</body>

    <head>Currys sales improve as shoppers ‘chase deals’ with credit</head>
    <body>Currys has reported improved sales as customers in Britain increasingly turn to loans to pay for energy-saving items such as air fryers and heat-pump tumble dryers amid the cost of living crisis. The UK’s biggest electrical retailer said cost cuts and a focus on promoting the sale of more profitable goods and services had improved its margins. However, it added that price inflation was causing further uncertainty for its future earnings and said it expects to report a decline in full-year profits when it releases its annual results in July. The company’s chief executive said Currys had benefited from a higher take-up of consumer credit that allows customers to pay off their purchases over a longer period of time, as well as repair and trade-in services, as households seek to stretch their budgets. “We’re seeing consumers lean more on credit to afford the technology that they need,” Alex Baldock told analysts and investors on Monday morning. He said Currys customers “are certainly chasing a deal and they’re looking for help with the affordability of their tech, with mechanics like trading. Consumers are concerned to see their expensive technology last longer, which is where our big repair business has had another strong year.” Baldock attributed the trends to rampant inflation, which stands at 10.1%. “The big picture on the UK consumer is that they remain hard-pressed by the cost of living crisis,” he said. “That’s playing through into relatively depressed demand for discretionary and big ticket products, and that’s placed downward pressure on the technology market. And that hasn’t changed.” The retailer said sales in the UK and Ireland had improved over the past two months, but from a very low base. In March and April, customers bought more energy-saving items including air fryers, microwaves and heat-pump tumble dryers. There was also an uptick in sales of consumer electronics such as headphones, as well as upmarket coffee makers and coffee bean roasting machines. “We’re not saying that consumers open their wallets in a carefree way at all, which is one of the reasons that we’re remaining cautious in our outlook,” Baldock said. Instead, Currys expects the tech market in the UK to “continue to go backwards” over the next 12 months amid the cost of living crisis, which has seen the cost of consumer goods soar as companies try to compensate for their own rising bills. “Consumer confidence may be up on where it was a couple of months ago, but it’s still at historically, pretty low levels.” Some of the biggest lag in consumer spending was around the “squeezed middle”, Baldock added. For example, while the sale of large screen TVs worth more than £1,200 and entry-level models worth less than £500 were “relatively healthy”, mid-market models worth between £500 and £1,000 had been “tougher” to shift. The chief executive said Currys had managed to increase its market share, despite putting fewer items on sale. Along with efforts to cut costs across its supply chain, it helped the retailer raise its full-year profit guidance, which is now expected to reach between £110m and £120m for the year to April, up from previous estimates of £104m. However, that is still down from £186m last year. Like-for-like sales are forecast to be down by 7% compared with a year earlier. “It’s a story of self help in a tough environment in the UK, which is encouraging because it leaves us in good shape to benefit from any recovery in the [macro-economic environment]. Not that we’re counting on one,” Baldock said.</body>

    <head>Keir Starmer says it ‘feels wrong’ EU citizens living in UK can’t vote</head>
    <body>Keir Starmer has said it “feels wrong” not to allow EU citizens who live and pay tax in the UK not to have the right to vote in general elections. While the Labour leader said there was “no settled policy”, he confirmed in an interview on LBC radio that the party was “looking at some of the voting issues”. The prospect could enfranchise about 5 million EU citizens over the age of 18 living in the UK with settled status. Starmer has said it does not pass the “common sense test” that settled migrants who have worked in the UK for decades do not have full voting rights. He said: “The thinking behind it is if someone’s been here say 10, 20, 30 years, contributing to this economy, contributing to the community, they ought to be able to vote. “Let me bring it alive – I’ve knocked on a lot of doors in the last few years, and you go to doors sometimes in a general election and you’re met with someone who says ‘look, I’m an EU citizen, I’ve been living here for 30 years, I’m married to a Brit. “‘My kids were raised and brought up here, they’re now working in the UK, we’re all working in lots of community projects but I can’t vote.’ “That feels wrong, and something ought to be done about it,” he told LBC presenter Nick Ferrari. Some non-British residents, Irish and Commonwealth citizens already have the right to vote in all elections in the UK as a result of historic ties within the UK. Extending that right to vote in general elections to other migrants has prompted criticism within Conservative party ranks and supporters. The Daily Mail in its front page on Monday declared Starmer was intending to “use EU citizens to ‘rig’ polls”, while the Tory party chair, Greg Hands, accused Labour of “laying the groundwork to drag the UK back into the EU by stealth”. He told the Telegraph: “This is an attempt to rig the electorate to rejoin the EU. The right to vote in parliamentary elections and choose the next UK Government is rightly restricted to British citizens and those with the closest historical links to our country.” The opposition leader said Labour was also considering expanding the voting franchise to allow 16- and 17-year-olds and settled migrants to cast a ballot. Allowing teenagers aged 16 and over to vote was also “not such an outlandish idea”, he said. Starmer added: “These are some of the ideas that are going into the mix, but they’re not policy – we’re just looking at them.”</body>

    <body>In the sample clues below, the links take you to explainers from our beginners series. The setter’s name often links to an interview with him or her, in case you feel like getting to know these people better. The news in clues Ye gods! A themed puzzle in the Times? Some kind of historic event? 9a Monarch to have something going on tomorrow (5) [ wordplay: abbrev. for current monarch + synonym for ‘to have’ ] [ CR + OWN ] [ definition: something going on tomorrow ] Ah yes, literally so. CROWN. “Meg”, “parade”, “queen-to-be” and others also feature. Elsewhere? Gaff has told us of his propensity for a theme, and there it is … 16a Famous street choir at noon performed without second thought (10) [ wordplay: anagram (‘performed’) of CHOIRATNOON without second letter of THOUGHT ] [ anagram of COIRATNOON ] [ definition: famous street ] … CORONATION in the Financial Times. Latter patter A different take on our titled friends in the Guardian. The annotated solution is now available for Brendan’s prize puzzle, which celebrates Duke Ellington, Lady Gaga and other members of the musical nobility. There is room of course for a musician who had her royal title awarded rather than having simply claimed it: 26a Old American statesman is blunt, taking nothing back (8) [ wordplay: synonym for ‘blunt’ + reversal (‘back’) of synonym for ‘nothing’ ] [ FRANK + backwards NIL ] [ definition: old American statesman ] 21d A change of heart for 26, queen of her genre (6) [ wordplay: A (‘A’) + anagram (‘change of’) HEART ] [ definition: solution to 26a, ‘queen of her genre’ ] So we see first FRANKLIN and then ARETHA, who’s sometimes a goddess as well as a queen of soul. Her name is not shared with many other Arethas: such is the way sometimes and a name becomes associated with one person and one only. It probably comes from the Greek “aretē”, meaning excellence; likewise excellent is the subject of our next challenge. Resembling the Hebrew “excellence”, “Ithra”, it was the name of Moses’s father-in-law and popular for a while among Puritans. Then no one really used it for a long time until some hairy musicians named their band after the Berkshire agriculturalist who perfected the horse-drawn seed drill and so the name enjoyed a 1970s revival. Reader, how would you clue JETHRO? Cluing competition Many thanks for your clues for PIVOT and I especially appreciate how many of them adopted the physics sense rather than the corporate lingo. Someone is clearly courting the audacity award in “Pilot out by 45° three fifths of the way through turn” – and it’s worked. Well played, Porcia. The runners-up are Rakali’s not-inaudacious “Progressive characters in politics will develop through constructive focus” and Montano’s apt “Belonging to SNP, I voted for change of direction”; the winner is the sly “Turn around Porto v Ipswich’s reverse fixture”. Kludos to Thespectacle. Please leave entries for the current competition – as well as your non-print finds and picks from the broadsheet cryptics – in the comments. Clue of the fortnight This one’s from the category “you have to stare at it for a while and take the sentence to pieces”, from Pangakupu. 23d Instruction to depart for one uppity solicitor (3,3) [ wordplay: reversal (‘uppity) of synonym for ‘for one’ + synonym for ‘solicitor’ ] [ reversal of EG + TOUT ] [ definition: instruction to depart ] GET OUT, you say?

    <head>Japanese talent agency apologises over claims founder sexually abused boys</head>
    <body>The president of one of Japan’s most powerful talent agencies has apologised over allegations that the firm’s late founder and pop impresario, Johnny Kitagawa, sexually abused multiple boys. In a video and statement released on Sunday evening, Julie Fujishima, Kitagawa’s niece, issued the apology to young men who had stepped forward with abuse claims, although she did not comment on the veracity of the allegations. Johnny &amp; Associates, the driving force behind a string of successful Japanese pop acts, had come under pressure to comment directly on the allegations after a former protege claimed he had been sexually assaulted on at least 15 occasions. Related: Former J-pop idol alleges sexual abuse by late music mogul Johnny Kitagawa Kauan Okamoto, a Japanese-Brazilian singer-songwriter, alleged in April that Kitagawa would abuse boys he had invited to stay overnight at his penthouse apartment in Tokyo, adding that his victims knew that speaking out would ruin their chances of becoming pop idols. Okamoto said he had been abused over a four-year period from 2012, when he was 15, as a member of Johnny’s Jr, a group of trainees who also worked as a talent pool for Johnny &amp; Associates. He added that he had been in the same room as three other boys when they were assaulted by Kitagawa. “First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest apologies” to the men who have come forward as victims, Fujishima said. She claimed she had not been aware of the abuse at the time, but added: “Obviously, we do not believe there was no problem. As a business and as an individual, I absolutely do not tolerate these acts. “On the other hand, it is not easy for us to simply declare by ourselves whether individual allegations can be recognised as facts or not, when we cannot confirm with the individual directly concerned, Johnny Kitagawa. “This is not the kind of occasion where you can be forgiven by saying: ‘I did not know.’ But the truth is that I did not.” Allegations against Kitagawa, who died in 2019 aged 87, have been public knowledge for more than 20 years, but were ignored by TV networks that depended on his agency to provide a steady stream of talent they would use to draw in younger viewers. In 1999, the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun ran a series of articles based on interviews with teenage boys who claimed he had sexually abused them. Kitagawa sued for libel and was awarded damages, but the judgment was partially overturned on appeal, with the Tokyo high court ruling in 2004 that the magazine’s allegations were mostly factual. Kitagawa’s appeal was rejected by the supreme court. He was never charged with a crime. Related: Predator: The Secret Scandal of J-Pop review – a breathtaking look at Japan’s paedophile boyband ‘god’ Kitagawa launched the careers of a string of boybands, including perennial favourites Smap and Arashi, over a career spanning more than half a century. At its peak, Johnny &amp; Associates managed clients who appeared in dozens of TV programmes and commercials. Kitagawa’s conduct has been in the spotlight since March, when the BBC documentary Predator: The Secret Scandal of J-Pop included interviews with other former Johnny’s members who said they had been sexually abused by the pop mogul. Penlight, a group of fans of Johnny’s boybands, said the agency’s decision to issue statements rather than hold a press conference had left many questions unanswered. “We ask the company to fully investigate and recognise the facts of the matter, to take responsibility as a corporation and apologise to the victims of sexual violence,” it said on Monday.

    <head>First Thing: Runoff increasingly likely in Turkish elections</head>
    <body>Good morning. Record high turnout in a tightly fought election has presented the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, with the greatest challenge to his leadership in two decades, amid signs that the vote was heading for a runoff even as Erdoğan attempted to claim victory before an official vote count had ended. Speaking to a jubilant crowd of supporters, an energised and delighted Erdoğan declared: “The fact that the election results have not yet been finalised does not diminish the fact that our nation’s choice is clearly in favor of us.” Despite Turkey’s supreme election council, the YSK, declaring that the count was not yet finished in either the parliamentary or presidential election, Erdoğan claimed his alliance had won a majority. “We believe I will finish with above 50% in the first round,” he added, projecting an outright win the presidential election without the need for a runoff. What are the results so far? With just over 99% of ballot boxes opened, Erdoğan has received 49.4% of votes in the country’s presidential election, the head of the country’s election council has said. Reuters is quoting Ahmet Yener as saying on Monday that Erdoğan’s rival, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, had scored 44.96%. What has Kılıçdaroğlu said? He hit back at Erdoğan in a more subdued speech: “Despite all of his lies and attacks, Erdoğan did not receive the desired outcome. No one should be enthusiastic about this being a done deal. The election is not won on the balcony,” he said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy arrives in London to meet ‘my friend’ Rishi Sunak Rishi Sunak embraces Volodymyr Zelenskiy at Chequers on 15 May 2023. Photograph: @RishiSunak The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has arrived in the UK for “substantive negotiations” with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak. In an early morning message as he landed in the UK, Zelenskiy confirmed he would “meet my friend Rishi” as Britain announced that it would send hundreds of new long-range attack drones with a range of over 200km to Ukraine. The visit is part of a tour of several key European allies ahead of an expected major Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian forces. Over the weekend, he was in Germany and Berlin announced Germany’s largest pledge in military aid since the start of the war. In a statement, the German defence ministry said the package would include 30 Leopard and 20 Marder tanks from industrial reserves, as well as armoured personnel carriers, reconnaissance drones and ammunition. Meanwhile, Zelenskiy has issued a new appeal to Nato today to make a “positive political decision” on Kyiv’s membership at its July summit. What is happening on the ground in Ukraine? Russia has said two of its military commanders were killed in eastern Ukraine, as Kyiv’s forces renewed efforts to break through Russian defences in the embattled city of Bakhmut. The Russian defence ministry said yesterday that commander Vyacheslav Makarov of the 4th motorised rifle brigade and deputy commander Yevgeny Brovko from a separate unit were killed trying to repel Ukrainian attacks. Border crossings reportedly decrease after Title 42 rules scrapped A child, who recently crossed the border, waits for food given by volunteers, in San Diego, California. Photograph: Étienne Laurent/EPA Crossings at the US border with Mexico have dropped 50% after Title 42 restrictions ended at the end of Thursday and the Biden White House implemented an arguably tougher immigration policy, the US homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, said on Sunday. Meanwhile, Joe Biden told White House pool reporters yesterday that the border situation immediately after Title 42’s elimination was “much better than you all expected”. The president said he did not plan to visit the border “in the near term” because to do so at this stage “would just be disruptive”. Mayorkas and Biden’s remarks yesterday were a defense of the policy which replaced the expired measure that allowed border officials to expel migrants 2.7m times to their home country or Mexico without hearing their asylum claims, ostensibly to limit the spread of Covid-19. Advocates have argued that the new Biden restrictions mimic two Donald Trump-era policies, but Mayorkas defiantly touted the updated measures, saying on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday that the “US Border Patrol has experienced a 50% drop in the number of encounters versus what we were experiencing earlier in the week before Title 42 ended”. What does the new rule mean? The rules now bar migrants from asylum if they don’t request refugee status in another country before entering the US. How many people have tried to cross the border following the end of Title 42? Mayorkas added that, on Friday, border patrol officers had detained 6,300 migrants and about 4,200 on Saturday, down from more than 10,000 “before the end of Title 42 earlier last week”. In other news … Nikki Haley is suffering from low polling – only 4.2%. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who is vying for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has distanced herself from calls for a federal abortion ban, saying that to promise such a universal barrier to terminations would be to lie to the American people. A Chinese court has sentenced a 78-year-old US citizen to life in prison on espionage charges. John Shing Wan Leung was detained in April 2021 by Chinese security services. The Hong Kong resident was chair of the Texas branch of Chinese ‘reunification’ association. The US rental car giant Hertz has apologized and pledged to retrain its staff after an employee denied a Puerto Rican customer a prepaid vehicle on the mistaken belief they needed a passport. During the incident a law enforcement officer allegedly threatened to turn the man over to immigration authorities even though Puerto Rico has been a US territory since 1898. The amount of adult speech children are exposed to in their early years may help to shape the structure of their brains, researchers say. Studies have previously suggested there are benefits to talking to young children, with research suggesting it can help improve their language processing and boost their vocabularies. Don’t miss this: why are so many young Americans adopting fake British accents? The reality show Love Island has fueled a habit among young Americans of shifting into a British accent in awkward situations. Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock Americans have long been called out for their phoney British accents – think Madonna in her Guy Ritchie era, or the friend who just came home from studying abroad in London. But generation Z has embraced bad imitations of cockney slang or a Yorkshire dialect, using obviously fake, theatrical voices to make light of low-grade daily dramas. “Fake British accent” videos have over 188,000 views on TikTok, where young people say they use the voice whenever they feel uncomfortable. Brinton Parker, a 30-year-old who lives in the Bay Area, works in tech marketing. She recently asked her manager for support at work after feeling like she was approaching burnout. “I said, ‘It’s affecting me mental health, innit?’” she explained. “And my boss was like, ‘Why did you say it like that?’ I think it adds levity to a vulnerable situation. The tougher the conversation, the more cockney I become.” … Or this: DNA evidence reveals family man in Australia was teenage killer who escaped Nebraska jail William Leslie Arnold killed his parents aged 16 in 1957 and escaped prison 10 years later, mystifying authorities until now. Photograph: US Marshals Service William Leslie Arnold was just 16 years old in 1958 when he killed his parents and buried them in the back yard after they refused to let him borrow the family car to take his girlfriend to a drive-in movie showing of The Undead. Two weeks later he was arrested, confessed to the killings and led investigators to his parents’ makeshift gravesite. The following year he was sentenced to two life sentences in the Nebraska state penitentiary. And that – most people expected – should have been that. But by the time Arnold died in 2010 in Brisbane, Australia, his life had taken a series of very unexpected turns. For one, he’d escaped prison in 1967, in what the prison warden said was one of the “cleanest” escapes in his experience, and then gone on the run for half a century. Climate check: climate crisis deniers target scientists for vicious abuse on Musk’s Twitter British scientists are concerned that the real effects of the climate crisis, such as this wildfire in Alberta, Canada, earlier this month, are not reaching the public. Photograph: Alberta Wildfire/Reuters A number of top scientists have spoken out about what they describe as a huge rise in abuse from climate crisis deniers on Twitter since the social media platform was taken over by Elon Musk last year. Since then, key figures who ensured “trusted” content was prioritised have been sacked, according to one scientist, and Twitter’s sustainability arm has vanished. At the same time several users with millions of followers who propagate false statements about the climate emergency, including Donald Trump and rightwing culture stirrer Jordan Peterson, have had their accounts reinstated. Climate scientists say the change has been stark, and they are fighting to make themselves heard over a “barrage” of often hostile comments. Last Thing: not having cellphone allowed US boy to save runaway bus from crashing In this image made from video, seventh-grader Dillon Reeves grabs the steering wheel on his school bus and hit the brakes after the driver passed out on 28 Apri. Photograph: AP A Michigan boy who recently stopped a school bus from crashing after the driver lost consciousness leapt into action because he was the only passenger not distracted by an electronic device, according to a new report from CBS. On Sunday, two weeks after seventh-grader Dillon Reeves regained control of a school bus when its driver became unconscious, the network reported that the boy’s parents’ refusal to provide him a cellphone paid off in a big way. Dillon’s father, Steve, told CBS: “What else are you going to do when you don’t have a phone? You’re going to look at people, you’re going to notice stuff. You’re going to look out the window.

    <head>More than 1,600 homeless families left in English hotels and B&amp;Bs past legal limit</head>
    <body>The number of homeless families being housed by English councils in hotels and B&amp;Bs for longer than the legal limit is at its highest in 20 years. The latest government figures show that 1,630 families were being housed in hotels and B&amp;Bs by councils in England past the six-week legal limit between October and December last year. This is the highest reported figure since 2003. It also marks the highest quarterly increase ever recorded, jumping 35% since data was last reported, for July to September last year. The problem is particularly acute in London. According to data from London Councils, the cross-party local government association for Greater London, there was an 180% increase in families being housed in hotels and B&amp;Bs for more than six weeks from 2021 to 2022. Many of these families have no access to cooking and clothes washing facilities and have to pay for laundry, storage services and takeaway food. Monica Rocha has been living in a Travelodge in Enfield with her two sons, aged 15 and five, since early February. They are one of 200 families currently being housed in commercial hotels by Enfield council. She was renting privately but was evicted from her home after the landlord decided to sell the property. She has not been able to find another property on the private rental market. “If you don’t earn over £40,000, it is very hard to get a property,” she said. “We saw a place that costs £1,600 per month. [The landlord] wanted me to earn £60,000.” Monica Rocha and her six-year-old son. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian The Guardian spoke to a number of families living in the Travelodge, most of whom said they had been homeless since being evicted from private rented accommodation due to a rent increase or the landlord wanting to sell the home. Rocha’s teenage son finds living in the hotel particularly difficult. “He tells me: ‘I feel suffocated, Mum’. He goes to the stairway to study because it’s quiet. It’s been affecting his studies and he got into a fight for the first time. “He keeps asking me: ‘Did [the council] tell you anything? When are we going to move?’ Every day it’s the same question. It is very difficult. When I cry, I have to cry by myself.” Rocha is an airport security officer. In accordance with Travelodge policy, she has to move rooms every 28 days, and she also says she has had to move out of the hotel temporarily several times. “I have to ask for annual leave to move. It’s very stressful. I never thought I’d be in this situation.” Piotr and Magdalena Rembikowski, who have been living in a Travelodge hotel room since last August. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian Piotr Rembikowski spoke to the Guardian in April. He is a wheelchair user with a reconstructed bowel, and had been living in the Travelodge since August last year. He said his booking had been extended until late June. Enfield council say that at least 6,000 homes in the borough are being used by other councils and government departments, including the Home Office. An Enfield council spokesperson said: “In February this year alone, 464 homeless families approached the council for help, compared to 196 in October 2021. Enfield residents are bearing the brunt of a national housing crisis.” Interactive A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “Over 600,000 households have been prevented from becoming homeless or supported into settled accommodation since 2018 but we know there is more to be done to help families at risk of losing their homes. “We are giving councils £1bn through the homelessness prevention grant over three years. This is on top of £26bn cost-of-living support this year. Local authorities have a duty to ensure no family is without a roof over their head, and temporary accommodation plays an important role in this.”</body>

    <head>Living in the Alaska rainforest with 1,000 bears: ‘Not the easiest place to be homeless’</head>
    <body>At a bend in a rushing river in the Alaska wilderness, the hatch of a nylon tent unzipped. A slight, curly-haired man in a vest emerged. Unhoused in the world’s largest temperate rainforest, Jacob Carroll said it was “no one’s goddamn business” how long he had been living in the woods, just outside the remote fishing town of Sitka. But he did agree to recount a few of his “multiple encounters” with bears. Related: The US city where ‘desert palaces’ are sprouting as affordable homes dwindle Once he had a stare-off with a young bear at night. The bear’s eyes glowed a fiery orange in the spray of his headlamp. Another time a bear got into his “igloo” – what he called his cooler. The bears are especially bad in the spring, before the salmon start to run, Carroll said. But that’s just the cost of being homeless in the woods, he decided. Situated on an island some 800 miles north of Seattle, unhoused people in the vicinity of Sitka face a particular peril: the Sitka brown bear, a brown bear that shows evidence of a genetic link to the polar bear. There are about 1,050 brown bears on the island – just under one bear per square mile, said Stephen Bethune, a wildlife biologist at the Alaska department of fish and game. And there are about 20 people living in the woods, according to the Sitka Homeless Coalition. As winter recedes and the days get longer, bears head for beaches where the greenest vegetation grows, Bethune said. The groggy creatures are “very motivated” by food, and might be attracted by any smells of more readily available meals along the way. This is how bears and unhoused Alaskans often come into contact. Sitka brown bears, a cross between the polar bear and the grizzly. Photograph: Donna Pomeroy/iNaturalist Tent cities have become common in the metropolises of the “Lower 48”. Although Sitka remains difficult to access – a town of 8,500 where more people own boats than cars, with just 14 miles of road – homelessness is on the rise here as well. Gayle Young, who co-founded the Sitka Homeless Coalition (SHC) in 2017, estimated that 35 people go without a home in Sitka – a number that increases in the summer when the weather turns, and the fishing industry kicks into gear, attracting “slime-line” laborers at the fish processors, and baristas at the pop-up food and coffee stands set up for the independent and cruise ship tourists. In 2020 Sitka was recognized as one of Alaska’s – and America’s – most picturesque towns, largely due to the historical buildings left from when it was under Russian control in the 19th century. Drawn in by the serenity of the fishing village vibe, and the seemingly endless pristine rainforest around town, visitor numbers from the continental US have snowballed. Cruise ship passengers have bounced from pre-pandemic numbers of about 158,000 in 2018 to nearly 600,000 projected for summer 2023. Median home prices have increased by 8% in the past year. “There is a shortage of available long-term rentals and affordable housing in the community,” said the Sitka realtor Kerri O’Toole. “Listing pricing continues to trend upward.” Homelessness is on the rise in the temperate rainforests of Sitka. Photograph: James Poulson “Everyone wants to be on this beautiful island, but that means that only people with a lot of money can afford a roof,” said Young, who helps unhoused people do their laundry every Monday between 8am and 11am at the Sitka laundromat. “Sitka is becoming a second-home community, and people are getting priced out. “If you’re already on the edge, you can easily get pushed off up here,” Young said. “And on top of that, to have bears in the spring – it certainly doesn’t make any of it easier.” Adult males can weigh over 1,000lbs, standing as much as 10ft tall, and are easily recognizable due to the pronounced hump behind the head that shifts when they walk. Bear attacks are rare, though they do occur. So far unhoused people have not been the victims. A man was mauled in August 2021, and survived after his friend shot the attacker. In 2012, a bear attacked and killed a Forest Service contractor in Poison Cove, north of town, Bethune said. “When they come out of hibernation is when a guy can get in trouble,” said Darian Bliss, 33, while sitting at a wooden picnic table in downtown Sitka eating lunch provided by the Salvation Army. “In the fall the bears are fat and happy after all the salmon. In the spring they just want to eat – anything.” Bliss came to Sitka for treatment for alcoholism and never left. He moves between the woods and various couches, and is in the process of trying to buy a fishing boat that will serve as shelter, a source of income, as well as a mode of transportation back to his home town of Ketchikan, south of Sitka. In the spring, he says that he tries to stay on boats and couches, to avoid the bears rather than live in the woods. Median home prices have risen by 8% in the past year in picturesque Sitka.

While camping at the base of Gavan Hill, he woke to the pressure of a bear’s paw on his hand. “When I opened my tent I saw tracks all over.” Another time in April he returned to his site to find the fabric of his tent slashed through. “It was violent. I mean – you could smell him. It made my hairs stand on end. The young ones are the ones to worry about.” Related: ‘It’s hell’: life under the American mobile home king who calls himself a ‘grave dancer’ Fortch “Stormy” Wayne, who arrived in Sitka from Ketchikan as a child and attended high school in town, has countless stories of bears plodding through his various campsites in the woods, where he lived for eight years, scaring them off with shouting and bear spray made of red pepper oil. As he strolled through a cemetery at the far end of Baranof Street, among lichen-coated headstones chiseled with Russian surnames, he recalled the time he encountered a bear digging out skunk cabbage root in the springtime. “When I saw him I yelled: ‘I don’t have anything for you, bear!’” The bears, along with the harsh winters and williwaw gusts off the mountainsides, compelled Stormy to apply for state-sponsored assisted living in town. “I just got tired of the winters, and always being afraid out there,” he said. He’s not the only one who believes Sitka’s unhoused need a refuge. The former magistrate judge Rachel DiNardo Jones said some of the court system’s “regulars” seem to commit petty offenses – urinating on squad cars, trespassing – in correspondence with the fall storms. “They just want to get out of the cold, and have three square hot meals. That’s what happens when there’s no shelter. Essentially Sitka’s jail is the town’s men’s shelter.” Andrew Hinton, the executive director of SHC, said that while he was impressed by the ability of Sitka’s unhoused population to forage and subsist he hopes to break ground this summer on a facility for 13 cabins with community showers, laundry and bathrooms. The project will allow SHC to address substance abuse problems, and to provide shelter – especially in the winter and spring. “We believe that people needing help for addiction should have shelter first. And then we can address the rest,” Hinton said. The new facility will have an electric fence around it, Hinton said, along with air horns, to keep out bears.

Photograph: James Poulson “These folks have to put up with so much,” Hinton said. “At the shelter they shouldn’t have to worry for their safety when they go to sleep.” On a recent morning a man named Kyle Sullivan followed a dim path cutting through the moss along the banks of Kaasda Heen River, not far from where Carroll lived. As the trail branched away from the bubbling current, salmonberry bushes and thorned devil’s club pushed up on either side. “For thousands of years bears on the island have been using this path to come down from the mountains after hibernation,” says Sullivan, 57, a denizen of the woods for the past couple of years. “People call it a ‘bear spirit trail’.” Following years of itinerant work in the continental US, fishing, horseback guiding, mucking out stalls and tiling, Sullivan ended up in Alaska. Unlike his two brothers who became miners in the footsteps of their father, Sullivan said he preferred the freedom of living in the open air. Related: How finding a home in America became so absurdly expensive When asked about Forest Service regulations that require people to move every 14 days, he cackled. “The Alaska troopers or police come around and annoy us with their flashlights. But we pretty much get left alone. Except in the springtime, when the bears wake up.” He added: “Bears keep you on your toes. It’s all a practice in not letting fear conquer you. It’s healthy not to be at the top of the food chain.” Sullivan said that he recognizes the dangers of sharing the forest with bears. He keeps a close eye on his site, and uses what he calls an “early detection system” for large and furry intruders. “It’s a bunch of strung-up trash bags. Once I heard a noise, opened my tent flap, and saw this bear staring at me from about 12ft away. I got him right in the eyes with the spray, and that sent him running right on home.” Read more about our housing project here • This article was amended on 15 May 2023 to describe the Sitka brown bear’s link to the polar bear more accurately.</body>

    <head>Butterfly Vision review – grim drama about Ukrainian prisoners of the Donbas war</head>
    <body>Ukrainian film-maker Maksym Nakonechnyi finished war drama Butterfly Vision last February, just days before the Russian invasion. His film tells a fictional story about a shellshocked female Ukrainian soldier held prisoner for two months by Russian-backed separatists in Donbas during the conflict that began in 2014. It’s a tough, unsparing movie, and possibly not the Ukrainian film that anyone wants to watch right now as the country fights for survival. Nakonechnyi’s reflective script, co-written with Iryna Tsilyk, doesn’t have Russia in its crosshairs; instead there are some inconveniently downbeat insights into the divided attitudes the soldier faces when she returns home. The soldier’s name is Lilya (Rita Burkovska), nicknamed “Butterfly”, an aerial reconnaissance expert who is released in a prisoner swap. We watch her reunion with her family in the format of a news bulletin, with the emojis and comments of online viewers flashing across the screen. One is an OMG about Lilya’s bedraggled appearance: “What happened to her gorgeous hair?” Others are more sympathetic: “It’s hard to imagine what she’s been through.” The thing is that nobody actually wants to know what Lilya has been through. There are deep scars carved into her back. We find out she was raped by her Russian guard; now she’s pregnant. The army investigator doesn’t ask if she was sexually assaulted (even though it was a well-known tactic and amounts to a war crime). It’s the same with her family. They know Lilya was tortured – horrifyingly, her mum talks about getting calls from the separatists on Lilya’s mobile, with her daughter’s screams in the background. But it’s just not a topic of conversation. Meanwhile, Lilya’s husband has joined a far-right vigilante group that attacks a Roma community. And one scene on a bus feels painful, in the real-life context of a year of hell, of Ukrainian nationalism, pride and patriotism: the driver refuses to accept Lilya’s veteran’s free travel card. The passengers mostly back him up; “It’s not my war,” one shouts. Butterfly Vision is Nakonechnyi’s feature debut; he has previously worked on documentaries about the conflict, which might explain the texture of truth here, his film’s grim believability. Though she might have turned the dial up, Burkovska conveys Lilya’s depression and anxiety, and finally her resilience, with a muted, powerful performance. This might be one to file away for the future, when the current conflict has ended. • Butterfly Vision is available from Wednesday on Mubi.</body>

    <head>The pet I’ll never forget: every night I would sing to Cackles the goose. Then tragedy struck</head>
    <body>Cackles was not technically a pet, I suppose, and certainly not the border collie I desperately craved, but she was my favourite goose. She was difficult to pet physically, but I tried my best, stroking her long, muscular neck. I sang to her nightly while she sat there quacking along. Or quacking in protest. It was hard to know the difference. I was very proud of her. No one else I knew had geese, except for the Ballantine’s distillery down the road, who had about 100 guarding the whisky. But no one from Ballantine’s went to my school, so that didn’t count. In short, it was unusual in the 80s to have geese, especially where we lived. But we kept a few at the old wreck of a cottage with a bit of land that my parents had managed to buy cheap – a tiny scrap of country in the middle of a council estate in Dumbarton. I was most proud when I had my birthday parties. They were so different from my friends’ celebrations. We would gather grass on the way home from school. A little gaggle of girls, with bundles of greenery held tight, back to my garden. I would show them how to feed the geese, not to be scared by those snake-like necks, by the hissing and flapping, the beaks, the long tongues and the little razor mouths. There would be nervous giggling and euphoria afterwards. The kids weren’t as scared of the geese as their parents. Some had good cause – my uncle Charlie was bitten in the nether regions by Billy, our cantankerous gander. I remember being scared, too, until I learned to stand my ground. As they chased me from behind, I would turn and they would stop short, as if they had run into a cartoon wall. “You just have to face them,” I would tell wary friends. “Don’t run.” Easier said than done, it would turn out. One day, I came home to find that Cackles was being taken away. She had chased a new mother wheeling a pram down our lane. The woman had been “terrified”. I was indignant: “Why did she run from a goose?” My dad said she had to go. I last saw her on my brother’s lap, in my dad’s van. She had a bag over her head, like it was some kind of waterfowl whacking. It was surreal and memorable for all the wrong reasons. I was heartbroken. My dad promised she went to a local farm for a happy retirement. I called him up for this piece. “Aye,” he said. “She did!” I am choosing to believe him.</body>

    <head>Recreate UK’s Homes for Ukraine scheme for Sudan refugees, urges one of plan’s architects</head>
    <body>One of the architects of Britain’s Homes for Ukraine scheme is calling on the government to replicate the programme for refugees from Sudan. Dr Krish Kandiah, the director of the Sanctuary Foundation, which was instrumental in matching many British hosts with Ukrainian refugees, said he wanted the country to show the “same generosity of spirit” to those fleeing war in Sudan as it did to Ukrainians. Within days of proposing the idea online, more than 100 people have formally registered with the organisation as being willing to host Sudanese families escaping the civil war. Kandiah said: “We’re not asking for unlimited numbers. We’re just asking for equity, that the same opportunity that was given to Ukrainians if they can find a sponsor and a host, can happen to a Sudanese person too.” He added: “The Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine Family scheme have been an incredible success, welcoming over 173,500 refugees to the UK, frequently being hosted in people’s homes. We need to show that same generosity of spirit and open hospitality to people from Sudan.” Chris Wilmott, 56, a retired university lecturer, and his wife, Anne Wilmott, 55, a doctor, have signed up to host at their home in Leicester if a visa route is established. They took in a Ukrainian couple for seven months last year and have space in their home again. Krish Kandiah, the director of Sanctuary Foundation, wants the UK to show the ‘same generosity of spirit’ to those fleeing war in Sudan as it did to Ukrainians. Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian Chris Wilmott said: “They’re fellow human beings fleeing from difficult situations. And if we’ve got the capacity to help them, we should do so. If we don’t have a Homes for Sudan type scheme, they’re in a chicken-and-egg difficulty as you can’t claim asylum unless you’re here, and we don’t have the safe routes to do that. And we’re making that increasingly difficult.” Cathy Ashley, a charity chief executive, has had a young Ukrainian woman living with her family in their south London home since last year. Their guest will be returning to Ukraine next month, and Ashley would like the option to help a Sudanese refugee in the same way. “I’ve enjoyed having her as part of our home and I want to be able to make that same offer available to those fleeing persecution in Sudan, because their need is as great,” Ashley said. “Without these safe routes, people are forced into terrifically desperate situations.” She added: “The government said there would be safe routes for those having to flee Sudan but there are none.” The Sanctuary Foundation is also proposing that the family visa scheme set up for Ukrainian relatives of people already living in Britain should be emulated for Sudan. Many expatriate Sudanese families living in Britain are worried for their relatives and want the opportunity to open up their homes. Chris Wilmott and his wife, Anne, have signed up to host Sudanese refugees at their home in Leicester if a visa route is established. Photograph: Chris and Anne Wilmott Mohammed Amin, 40, arrived as a refugee by boat from Calais in 2020 after fleeing Sudan and now has asylum. His sister and nephew recently fled Khartoum and he wants them to be able to live with him. “The situation is so bad. We need the same things that were done for Ukraine,” he said. “I’m trying to help them but it’s difficult. They ran out of Khartoum and they have no food, no place, and I’m trying to send them money from here to there but the banks aren’t working.” Algaly Saeed, who came to Britain from Sudan almost two decades ago, wants his adult son Hussam, who has been living in Khartoum, to be able to join him. Saeed, 56, who works as a taxi driver and lives with his wife and daughter in a four-bedroom house in Rotherham, says he has room for him to join. “All we ask is for the British people to help us like they did Ukrainians,” he said. A government spokesperson said there were no plans to open a “bespoke resettlement route” for Sudan, adding that it was focused on preventing a humanitarian emergency by “working with international partners and the United Nations to bring an end to fighting”. “Since 2015 we have offered a safe and legal route to the UK to almost half a million people seeking safety but our approach must be considered in the round, rather than on a crisis-by-crisis basis.”</body>

    <head>Rachel Roddy’s recipe for spaghetti with asparagus, butter and lemon</head>
    <body>A 10cm x 10cm wooden square with a large hole crossed with wire strings: it could be a tiny harp if it didn’t also have another set of 12 strings that cross the first, forming a mesh. Even so, it can be strummed with a long nail, the basic strum audible, if you get in close. Its actual purpose is for slicing puntarelle, the inner tubes of a variety of chicory called cicoria di catalogna or cicoria asparago (asparagus chicory). A late winter-to-early spring vegetable, succulent puntarelle, with its asparagus-like tips, or punte, is a popular salad in Lazio, so the basic, nifty and cheap square cutters (tagliapuntarelle) are common and easy to come by in hardware stores. And much as puntarelle migrates and thrives in soil all over the place, so do the cutters. Of course, you don’t need a cutter; a knife works just as well, only more slowly. I also know several people who have made themselves a tagliapuntarelle, inspired by the larger cutters you sometimes see on market stalls: wooden boxes or frames strung with wire. Big or small, it is a fantastically satisfying tool, the crisp tubes of chicory cutting like butter into thin strips, or, if you want to keep the tips intact, puntarelle octopi! And it isn’t only for puntarelle: celery, courgettes and red pepper work on this tool, too; large vegetables turned into fat strings in two musical seconds. Last week, while I know I can’t be the first to have done so, I did feel like a genius when I pushed asparagus through the mesh. I took off the tips first, so as not to offend them, but later wondered if they could go through, too. Asparagus stems are even more satisfying than puntarelle, because they sail through the wires and splay out like straight tentacles more or less the same proportions as spaghetti. Which is why, if the strips are wilted down in oil and given plenty of butter and lemon zest, they pair so well with spaghetti, for what is a two-tone joy and maybe my favourite recipe so far this year. As always, the final stirring is crucial. It’s when the pasta, asparagus, starch, fat and pan juices combine and everything comes together, so don’t be afraid to swish the pan and stir vigorously. I would also like to apologise vigorously for going on about a kitchen gadget that most people won’t have. Which is why this column is also an advert for the various makers of this good-value object and, more importantly, calls to anyone capable of stringing wire or adapting instruments. I am also interested in commissioning a larger model, for both oversized courgettes and strumming practice. Spaghetti with asparagus, butter and lemon Serves 4 1 x large bunch asparagus (about 250g) 3-4 spring onions 4 tbsp olive oil Salt 450g spaghetti 40g butter Finely grated zest of 1 unwaxed lemon, plus 2 tbsp lemon juice Trim the end of the asparagus as you prefer: snap off the woody ends or pare away the woody parts with a potato-peeler. Cut off the tips, then cut the spears lengthways into thin strings as close in size to spaghetti as you can. Trim the spring onions, then slice the bulbs into arcs and the green parts into short lengths. You want to coordinate the cooking so that both the vegetables, which take about 10 minutes to soften, are ready at the same time as the spaghetti, which, depending on the brand, can take anything from seven to 11 minutes, so drop the spaghetti into salted boiling water accordingly. While the pasta is cooking, warm the oil in a large frying pan set over a medium-low heat, soften the spring onions for a minute, then add the asparagus and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring, until it wilts; carry over a ladleful of the pasta cooking water, all cloudy with starch, to help it along – once cooked, the asparagus should be soft with just a little juice. Stir in the butter, lemon juice and zest. Drain the pasta (or lift it directly into the asparagus mix), then toss and swish vigorously for a minute or so, or until everything combines. Serve immediately, with grated parmesan for those who want it.</body>

    <head>The US asylum rule replacing Title 42 is strict – here’s what we know</head>
    <body>Last week, the Biden administration toughened its stance against migration at the US-Mexico border through a new federal regulation that severely restricts access to asylum. This “Circumvention of Lawful Pathways” rule effectively replaces the Title 42 public health order, which Donald Trump introduced ostensibly to stem Covid-19 but has functioned increasingly as an immigration enforcement tool, allowing border officials to quickly expel migrants without the chance to request asylum in the US. Title 42 ended on 11 May. Related: Calm prevails at US-Mexico border after Title 42 migration restrictions lifted The new regulation means people fleeing their home countries because of unlivable violence and instability are rendered ineligible for asylum unless they can meet one of a handful of exceptions. As a result, the US will probably return many more vulnerable people to dangerous situations. The rule is being challenged in federal court by advocacy groups. What does the rule do? Generally, the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule means those traveling through a third country before reaching Mexico and the US-Mexico border will be presumed ineligible for asylum, with limited exceptions. In practice, most nationalities seeking American protection will be disqualified from asylum if they reach the southern border by land or water and can’t overcome a “presumption of asylum ineligibility”. Who will be ineligible for asylum? Those requesting asylum in the US now will generally be presumed ineligible unless they or their accompanying family member can show they: already have permission to enter through a parole process approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). use a DHS scheduling system like CBP One – a recently developed government phone app – to secure a coveted appointment to present themselves at an official border port of entry. Or show up at a port of entry and meet a very high bar for why they couldn’t use the scheduling system. have sought protection in another country en route to the US and been denied it. Mexicans typically don’t transit through another country before reaching the border, so they are generally exempt from the new rule’s presumption of asylum ineligibility, though historically Mexicans in US immigration court have especially low rates of being granted asylum. Children who migrate unaccompanied by a parent or legal guardian may seek asylum, unaffected by the regulation. For others, even if they pass initial screenings for protection, they still face the presumption of ineligibility during their full immigration court proceedings. There’s the opportunity for rebuttal, but the chance of success is probably slim. Why can’t all asylum seekers just comply with the stated exceptions? In practice, the exceptions are weighted against the world’s most at-risk people. They are: Exception one: permission to enter. The Biden administration is offering specific parole processes, allowing up to 30,000 people total from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Haiti and Cuba to enter each month. But those people must obtain a passport, fly to the US and find a US-based sponsor who will support them financially. The government also recently announced more or improved family reunification parole processes for Colombians, Salvadorians, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Cubans and Haitians who already have approved, family-based petitions for green cards. These are invitation-only and apply to relatively few migrants. Exception two: CBP One appointments. The CBP One app offers a very limited number of daily appointments to begin the asylum process. Users – who need a smartphone – have reported glitches and deficiencies, causing frustration for those waiting on the Mexican side of the border. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has made some changes but the roughly 1,000 available daily appointments still can’t meet demand. Exception three: unsuccessfully sought protection elsewhere. Joe Biden has referred to “the greatest migration in human history” across the western hemisphere, driven by political instability or dictatorship, economic calamity, natural disaster and violence. Yet many of the countries that asylum seekers pass through overland on their way to the US are potentially dangerous places from which local residents are already simultaneously fleeing, and where poor travelers are targets for criminals. Conditions in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have sent many thousands to the US. And asylum systems in places such as Mexico, Costa Rica and Colombia are already under significant strain, which this federal regulation could exacerbate. Why can’t people just wait in Mexico for an asylum appointment in the US? When a previous Trump-era policy – the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico” – stranded people at the border, there were more than 1,300 reports of rape, kidnapping and other attacks. Since Biden took office, there have been approximately 13,500 reports of migrants and asylum seekers facing similar violence after being blocked in Mexico or expelled there under Title 42. Meanwhile, more than seven in 10 women in Mexico have experienced gender-based violence amid a decades-long femicide crisis. What about other forms of protection? Asylum seekers may still qualify for other, lesser, protections, for example for victims of torture. But, especially with the stresses endured on the way to and at the border, and during expedited processing, many will struggle to make their case. What are the other hardline rules at play? The Biden administration has also expanded the use of expedited removal, in which people are rapidly deported and given a five-year bar to re-entry; threatened potential criminal prosecution for those attempting to re-enter the US after being removed; expedited initial asylum screenings – called credible fear interviews – in border facilities, conducted by telephone soon after apprehension and with limited access to an attorney, also only by telephone; increased removal flights; and made an agreement in which Mexico accepts certain deported non-Mexicans. Together they make it far more difficult for asylum seekers with legitimate claims to access protection in the US. What about US and international law? Domestic law says that any non-citizen arriving in the US or already there – regardless of immigration status or how they entered – has a right to seek asylum. And the US is bound to international treaties protecting the rights of those fleeing specific kinds of threats. Accordingly, under federal law the authorities cannot return people to places where they face persecution or torture. The Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule inherently challenges these principles by potentially sending asylum seekers with legitimate claims back to danger. Attorneys for the union representing 14,000 US Citizenship and Immigration Services employees, including asylum officers, had urged Biden to rescind it, so that officers do not become “complicit in violations of US and international law”. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has also protested.

    <head>White House timidity on the debt ceiling is infuriating. What is it afraid of?</head>
    <body>One wonders what the Biden administration is afraid of when it comes to calling the Republicans’s bluff on raising the federal debt ceiling. While White House officials no doubt have genuine legal and policy concerns about their ability to act unilaterally to defuse the crisis, the overriding reason is probably fear of the political consequences, and on that front they are both misreading the moment and misunderstanding the composition of the country’s electorate. Related: The Democrats have a powerful campaign issue: price-gouging corporations | Robert Reich To quickly recap, Congress passes laws to “promote the general welfare” of the public, and those laws usually cost money. Not infrequently, the cost of those laws exceeds the amount of money the government has in the bank, so they have to borrow money to pay the bills. But because of an obscure 1917 law, the amount of loans the government can take out to pay its bills is capped at a set (and, frankly, relatively arbitrary) amount. When this happens, Congress must raise the limit of how much money can be borrowed to meet the country’s obligations. When a Republican is in the White House, this basic duty happens without any drama or fanfare. The limit gets raised, the bills get paid, and life goes on. But after Barack Obama was elected president, “burn it down” Republicans have taken to using the need to raise the debt limit as an opportunity to hold the government hostage and demand draconian cuts in spending programs – previously congressionally approved spending programs, mind you – in exchange for increasing the authority to borrow more money. Despite near-universal agreement that the economic shock and turmoil of defaulting on the debt would be catastrophic, the Republicans don’t care and use the potential economic crisis to pursue their destructive agenda. That is the behavior of terrorists. For its part, the administration has said it won’t negotiate with terrorists and is insisting that Congress pass a “clean” debt-limit increase. In a speech last week, President Biden said that Republicans are “literally, not figuratively, holding the economy hostage”. So we are at a standoff with dire economic consequences, particularly for low-income Americans and people of color still working to overcome the nation’s gargantuan racial wealth gap that accounts for much of the nation’s inequality in education, housing and employment. In the face of this impending emergency, myriad proposals have surfaced to call Congress’s bluff and ignore the ransom demand. Respected Harvard professor Lawrence Tribe has advocated for simply challenging the constitutionality of the 1917 law as a violation of “section 4 of the 14th amendment [which] says the ‘validity’ of the public debt ‘shall not be questioned’ – ever.” Another hostage-ending approach championed by Willamette University law professor Rohan Grey and New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman would be to have the treasury secretary simply mint a trillion-dollar coin and put it up as a guarantee that the US will pay its debts. Krugman writes that minting the coin and bypassing Congress “would be economically harmless – and would both avoid catastrophic economic developments and help head off government by blackmail”. The good news is that these solutions, once entertained as too radical or risky, are at least in the conversation. As recently as last week, President Biden said after meeting with the Republican House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, that he was still “considering the 14th amendment”. The bad news is that the president’s advisers are tiptoeing around these options for fear of them being “risky” in terms of the reaction on Wall Street and in the financial markets. Well, defaulting on debts is what’s really risky, and the economy and markets have always shown remarkable resilience, bouncing back from previously unthinkable shocks (the S&amp;P 500 stock index doubled in value after absorbing the pandemic shock of entire world economy essentially shutting down). Most fundamentally, the timidity of the White House leaders stems from a misreading of the political moment we are in and the nature of the opposition they face. The leaders of the Republican party do not care about the economy, our democracy, or the United States of America (emphasis on united; they care about a scattered number of states, most of them the former slave-holding states of the Confederacy). This is not a public policy dispute among well-meaning civic leaders with different political philosophies. The Republicans do not subscribe to the same social contract or constitution that governs binds the nation. This was made most clear on 6 January 2021 when the majority of the Republicans in Congress voted to overthrow the elected government of the United States. They are engaged in a ferocious battle to beat back the growing power of a multiracial electorate and any public policies designed to meet the needs of that multiracial nation. Believing that there is any reasoning with these folks is folly. Furthermore, a close reading of public opinion polls shows that the electorate is on the side of the president, and, most importantly, the overwhelming majority of the groups in the population that put Biden in the White House in 2020 (and held the Senate in 2022). The April CBS News/YouGov poll found that, when informed of the consequences of default, 70% of all voters support raising the debt limit. Among African Americans, 85% of those polled support an increase; 72% of Latinos support the raise. Even among white voters – whose support for Democrats is historically capped around 40% – a sizable majority, 67% support a debt limit increase. Which brings us back to the question. What are they afraid of?</body>

    <head>Hertha Berlin are done. The only question is how much worse it gets</head>
    <body>“Maybe it was my mistake,” pondered Pal Dardai, the Hertha coach, “that we were too busy working on the offensive side [of the game] during the week. Because defensively, there was nothing at all.” Dardai, a club legend, is too hard on himself. Nobody blames him, parachuted in during the last knockings of this shambolic season as a hopeful punt, as was evidenced by the standing ovation he received from members when taking the stage at Sunday morning’s club AGM. Related: Lewandowski fires Barça to La Liga title but invoke Espanyol fans’ wrath That very reasonable point of view notwithstanding, Dardai is left holding a team in name only, with a first relegation in 11 years looming after Friday night’s 5-2 hammering at Köln which could, and should, have been so much worse. “Without meaning to offend anyone,” said Steffen Baumgart, Köln’s coach, “5-2 is not a good result for the chances we had.” He went on to describe Oliver Christensen – the Hertha goalkeeper who was an overworked, furious ball of energy by the end – as “the best player on the pitch.” From the eighth minute when Davie Selke – who joined in January from Hertha, naturally – soared imperiously to head home the opener, the visitors were in a spin. Remarkably, they recovered to lead against the run of play via goals from Lucas Tousart and Stevan Jovetic, both relics of a more ambitious, hopeful time. Yet they were losing again by half-time and Köln’s two second-half goals from Timo Hübers and Denis Huseinbasic gave them relatively little to show for their avalanche of attacks. “We left some gaps defensively,” Marvin Plattenhardt, the Hertha captain, told DAZN, with a lorryload of understatement. Florian Niederlechner’s summation that “Köln overran us in the second half” was nearer the mark. Overall, Baumgart’s men had 15 shots on target and hit the woodwork twice. Hertha’s situation was made even more dire by Bochum’s gutsy 3-2 win over Augsburg on Saturday afternoon, but nobody in the RheinEnergieStadion the night before was in any doubt anyway. This Hertha team are done, vanquished. The only question now is how much worse it might get. Sorting out this mess of a playing squad (which will be no easy feat) is only the tip of a particularly angular iceberg. Reports this week suggested Hertha receiving their operating licence from the DFL for 2023-24 was no fait accompli, with a high-interest €40m bond issued in 2018 due to be repaid in autumn. Werner Gegenbauer, their previous president, talked about the urgency of repaying it as early as 2020 but it never happened. New investor 777 Partners may need to step in with another hefty sum to calm the waters, though what that would mean for the club’s sporting future is another question. Hertha’s players and staff go over to apologise to the fans. Photograph: Ralf Treese/DeFodi Images/Shutterstock It had been a tough week for Hertha even before the Köln defeat. Ingmar Pering, an influential board member (and erstwhile presidential candidate) resigned on Thursday after 15 years at the club. His resignation statement, leaked to Kicker, did not spare the regime led by the current president Kay Bernstein, rather than laying it all at the door of Gegenbauer and the recently exited major investor Lars Windhorst. Pering called the deal with 777 “a hasty process by the presidency” which left no room “to consider alternatives”, meaning a refusal would have left “no real alternative to economic collapse and bankruptcy.” He went on to write that the Bernstein era was even more difficult to align himself with than Gegenbauer’s. “Now we don’t just have to deal with selfish power people who are only concerned about personal gain,” said Pering, “but also with collective incompetence.” Hertha are in a bad way on and off the pitch. Photograph: Ralf Treese/DeFodi Images/Shutterstock Bernstein was bold at the epic, seven-and-a-half-hour AGM, telling attendees that the project to build a new, more intimate and suitable stadium than the cavernous Olympiastadion was on track, and reiterating the plan to move forwards with youth academy products. Yet Tom Herrich, the managing director, confirming that there was indeed work to do to secure the licence for next season meant he provided the weightiest words from the stage all day. After Stuttgart’s draw with Leverkusen on Sunday – Andreas “Zecke” Neuendorf, Hertha’s licensing director, broke news of Exequiel Palacios’ equaliser for Die Werkself during his own speech as a rallying cry – the Berlin club need almost a mathematical miracle to escape. Yet the real verdict had fallen on Friday night. If anyone was in any doubt about how deep the malaise runs at Hertha, Dardai’s team had already given the most eloquent statement possible on the matter. Talking points • At the top, Bayern Munich still hold their one-point advantage and were a much more familiar Bayern in their 6-0 demolition of Schalke at Allianz Arena. Restored to the lineup, Thomas Müller opened the scoring and batted away speculation over his future. “My heart is red,” he said. “Everyone’s is red, but mine might be a little redder.” As well as the loss Schalke suffered the blow of Marius Bülter’s fifth yellow card, which means their key player will miss next week’s crunch game against Eintracht Frankfurt (who secured a first Bundesliga win since mid-February, 3-0 over Mainz, after a testing week in which Oliver Glasner’s end-of-season exit was confirmed). Köln 5-2 Hertha Berlin VfL Bochum 3-2 Augsburg Wolfsburg 2-1 Hoffenheim Bayern Munich 6-0 Schalke Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 Mainz Union Berlin 4-2 Freiburg Borussia Dortmund 5-2 Borussia Mönchengladbach VfB Stuttgart 1-1 Bayer Leverkusen RB Leipzig 2-1 Werder Bremen • Borussia Dortmund stayed on Bayern’s tail with a 5-2 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach. It featured a first half as ruthless as Old Bayern (they were 4-0 up at the break) and a coda which was more Old Dortmund, as they carelessly shipped two late goals and needed a great Gregor Kobel save from Lars Stindl, who scored Gladbach’s second, to prevent the visitors from pulling it back to 4-3, before Gio Reyna tapped in with the game’s final kick. Despite the late “Stuttgart vibes” as Julian Brandt put it – referencing Dortmund’s late surrender of a lead against the 10-man strugglers a few weeks back – the mood is positive before what is likely to be a pivotal week: Bayern face Champions League-chasing Leizpig and BVB, fragile on the road of late, go to Augsburg. Gio Reyna celebrates after sealing a chaotic 5-2 win for Dortmund. Photograph: Ralf Treese/DeFodi Images/Shutterstock • The season’s real fairytale took greater shape as Union Berlin beat Freiburg 4-2 in an absolute thriller. Inspired by two-goal Sheraldo Becker, the home side led 3-0 before half-time. Goals back from Manuel Gulde and Vincenzo Grifo caused a wobble before Aïssa Laïdouni, on as a substitute, sealed it late on. The Köpenickers need a maximum of four points from their remaining two games to make sure of a debut Champions League campaign in September. “I’m so happy,” said their normally reserved coach Urs Fischer. “I can’t really believe it at the moment.” Their success was also lauded by his opposite number, Christian Streich, even if the loss strongly compromised his own team’s chances of a top-four finish. • Another huge blow for the fading Freiburgers was Dominik Szoboszlai’s late, late winner for Leipzig in Sunday’s game against Werder Bremen, in which they had trailed to a Leonardo Bittencourt sucker punch before Christopher Nkunku brilliantly created goals for Willi Orban and his fellow Hungarian in the dying minutes. It could also tweak the title race. With a four-point lead over Freiburg in fifth (and a far superior goal difference), Marco Rose and company now go to Munich with a desire for points rather than a desperate need for them.

    <head>Vice files for bankruptcy protection amid cut-price sale to consortium</head>
    <body>Vice, the once high-flying media startup that reached a peak valuation of nearly $6bn (£5bn), has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US as the digital publisher engineers a cut-price sale to a group of lenders. The company, whose assets include Vice News, Motherboard, Refinery29 and Vice TV, has agreed a sale to a consortium that includes Fortress Investment Group, Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital for $225m in the form of a credit bid for its assets as well as assuming Vice’s “significant liabilities”. Creditors can swap their secured debt, rather than pay cash, for the company’s assets. Vice said it “expects to emerge as a financially healthy and stronger company” when the process concludes. Under the deal, which also has a provision that Vice could still be sold to a third party if a higher bid emerges, the lenders are also providing more than $20m and other financing to fund Vice throughout the sale process. The sale, which is expected to conclude in two to three months, comes after years of financial difficulties and executive turmoil at Vice. “This accelerated court-supervised sale process will strengthen the company and position Vice for long-term growth,” said Bruce Dixon and Hozefa Lokhandwala, co-chief executive officers at Vice. “We will have new ownership, a simplified capital structure and the ability to operate without the legacy liabilities that have been burdening our business.” Vice, which hit a valuation of $5.7bn in 2017 as media giants including Rupert Murdoch, WPP and Disney clamoured for a slice of its youth appeal, had been seeking a sale of about $1.5bn. In April, the company – which has been evaluating its future since plans to float using a special purpose acquisition vehicle (Spac) collapsed two years ago – announced it was cancelling its popular Vice News Tonight as part of a restructuring that could make more than 100 staff being made redundant. In February, Fortress, the company’s debt holder, extended a $30m funding line to let Vice pay overdue bills to vendors. The same month, Nancy Dubuc, who took over as chief executive from controversial co-founder Shane Smith in 2018, announced her surprise departure. Vice, which began as a punk magazine in Montreal almost three decades ago, expanded into digital media and TV by striking deals with firms including Sky and HBO. The promise of successfully tapping the media habits of a global youth audience attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of investment from firms, including Disney, which explored a $3bn-plus deal to buy Vice in 2015. Disney wrote off its $400m investment in Vice as worthless in 2019. Vice was among a generation of fast-rising digital media upstarts such as BuzzFeed that once threatened to supplant legacy media companies with the right recipe for attracting millennial audiences. In April, BuzzFeed, which has a market value of $75m after a disastrous initial public offering last year, announced the closure of the remainder of its once highly lauded BuzzFeed News operation and that it was cutting 180 staff across the rest of the business.</body>

    <head>Poem of the week: Der Kleiber … by Sujata Bhatt</head>
    <body>Der Kleiber: Eurasian Nuthatch (Sitta europaea) … What’s the littlest thing You can spin a poem out of … ? Michael Schmidt * Over here there are enough trees to make us feel sheltered. We hear it first, a loud song: the clear notes so sharp it makes us stop. But there is no fear we think, no pain. When we look up we see the bird: tiny, unlikely. You say it’s the only bird that can descend trees headfirst. The bird hovers. I say it might fly away. This one has a blue-grey upper body And orange-peach underparts. We watch it climb higher and forage. And then we hear it sing again. We watch, not wanting to disturb it. And yet, not wanting to leave. There we stand, looking up, when suddenly the bird moves down the tree, headfirst. Unusually, this week’s poem is from a literary journal, not a collection. The journal, PNR, this month celebrates its distinguished 50th anniversary. PotW is pleased to add its own tribute with a new poem from the anniversary issue. Der Kleiber: Eurasian Nuthatch is a deceptively simple poem. The diction is plain: there is no special figurative effort to conjure the bird and inventively dazzle the reader. The tone is not that of the celebratory nature poem. Its curtness might be on the edge of humour, but there are hints of greater disturbance under the surface. The speaker doesn’t reassure the reader with specificity of context: we don’t know where “over here” is located. Interviewed in Kunapipi, Bhatt described her reluctance to be geographically placed and fixed. The polylingual naming of the bird in the current poem’s title may be indicative. Does this connect with a particular need (line two) for the two people in the poem to “feel sheltered”? Why, in the next verse, although the implication is rejected, should the nuthatch’s loud call raise the possibility of fear or pain? Visible, the bird’s reality seems not quite trusted: “tiny, unlikely” to the speaker’s eye, it’s almost not there. Perhaps distracted, the couple begin a conversation which doesn’t coalesce: the addressee, the poem’s “you”, explains about the bird’s proclivity for descending trees headfirst, and the speaker responds with anxiety: “I say it might fly away”. The scrap of dialogue is cleverly done, suggesting that each might want to say something else altogether, or, perhaps more likely, that the speaker would have preferred her companion to say nothing at all. Then the ambiguity dissolves in the poem’s observations of the bird’s colouration. The colours are typical of nuthatch plumage, but singled out as characteristics particular to “this” bird. “This one has a blue-grey upper body / and orange-peach underparts.” The precision of the colour-description gives these two lines a gentle, conclusive glow. Like the speaker, the poem seems calmed by the moment of concentration. At last, the anxious surface settles. In another of Bhatt’s poems, The Swan Princess Speaks, the narrator declares “I wanted to be everything: / a girl and a swan. I wanted to be free / to be a bird at home in any land, / at home on water and in the air.” Although the tone and style of Der Kleiber: Eurasian Nuthatch are quite different from the impassioned, wounded mythologising of The Swan Princess Speaks, perhaps the simple bird-as-itself also represents versatility and freedom, being the natural inhabitant of two elements, the air and the earth-rooted trees. Sharing indecision about what further movements they can risk without scaring the bird, the couple seems to achieve a stilled unity – “There we stand, looking up”. It’s as if they’d forgotten any expectations about nuthatch behaviour and were simply lost in looking. But it’s then that “the bird moves down the tree, headfirst.” At this point, we might remind ourselves of the epigraph (from Michael Schmidt’s A Bright Jewel in An Aethiope’s Ear). And we might ask ourselves if the poem itself is about finding “the littlest thing / you can spin a poem out of” or, indeed, the process of writing itself. Der Kleiber: Eurasian Nuthatch appears to be simple documentary rather than word-spinning. It’s not in search of an epiphany, and yet, perhaps for that very reason, it finally earns one. • Sujata Bhatt’s latest poetry collection is Poppies in Translation.</body>

    <head>‘I was sick with pain – but doctors thought I was a hypochondriac’: the spreading agony of kidney stones</head>
    <body>Donna, 33, from Suffolk, first developed the telltale signs of kidney problems 13 years ago when she experienced excruciating pain under her ribs. “I was being physically sick because of the pain, and kept going to hospital,” she says. “I was repeatedly dismissed by doctors because they couldn’t find anything on my scans. They thought I was a hypochondriac.” She was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and told to make lifestyle changes. “I tried different diets but nothing helped, so I learned to live with the pain,” she says. Ten years later, while living and working in Spain, she was finally diagnosed with kidney stones. “A doctor did a scan to check I wasn’t pregnant and couldn’t believe the state of my kidney.” Donna was rushed in for surgery, where they found a 2cm stone, surrounded by severe infection. “The kidney was so weak it collapsed when they removed the stone and needed to be reconstructed,” she says. “After the operation I was rushed back into hospital with a blood clot and fever, and urine was leaking into my abdomen. I was so ill I nearly died.” Kidney stones are formed from hard deposits of minerals and salts and cause excruciating pain when they try to pass through your urinary tract. They have traditionally been associated with older men and are most common between the ages of 30 and 60. But new research has shown that the condition is on the rise in all age groups, including young women and teenagers. According to the NHS, up to one in 10 people will get kidney stones in their lifetime. About half of sufferers will have them again within five years of their initial diagnosis and for those who get complications, they can be severe. Due to the increased use of CT scans, kidney stones are now easier for clinicians to spot than ever before, but other factors, such as rising obesity, weight loss surgery and lack of fluid intake are also responsible for the higher number of cases.

Photograph: Javier Fernández Sánchez/Getty Images Doctors told Donna that her undetected stone was likely caused by years of severe and untreated urinary tract infections (UTIs). “I feel because I was young and a woman my voice wasn’t heard,” she says. According to Dr Lafina Diamandis, a GP and certified lifestyle medicine doctor for Deia Health, UTIs are a common cause of kidney stones, especially in young women. “They’re most likely to cause a type of stone called a struvite stone,” she says. “UTIs make the urine more alkaline and create the perfect environment for stone formation. Women are more prone to UTIs.” The other two common types of kidney stones are uric acid stones and calcium stones, which can both be affected by diet. “Uric acid stones are associated with a higher intake of animal proteins found in a high-protein diet. This is due to the high purine content found in meat, a chemical formed when we break down protein,” says Diamandis. “A high level of purines can make the urine too acidic, increasing the risk of stone formation.” The rising popularity of seemingly healthy low-carb diets, such as Keto, may play a role. “Carbs have been demonised in recent years, but we need them in our diets. Ideally, your plate should be 50% vegetables, 25% protein and 25% complex carbohydrates, found in whole plant foods such as beans, oatmeal, quinoa and sweet potatoes.” She also thinks the consumption of highly processed, fatty foods and lack of fluid intake may be contributing to the rise in kidney stones. These foods are often full of salt and sugar, meaning our kidneys have to work harder. “Salty food increases the risk of dehydration, so if you’re not drinking enough water the risk will increase further.” Some studies have shown that dehydration as a result of global heating is also contributing to the rising number of kidney stone cases. ‘I’ve completely changed the way I eat’ … John Chafer. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian When John Chafer, 60, a local councillor from Essex, first developed kidney stones in his early 40s, he had no idea it could be linked to his diet. “I was quite overweight, I wasn’t drinking enough water and was having lots of junk food,” he says. After recovering from his first bout of kidney stones, “I wasn’t given any preventive advice or told they could come back. I passed the stone so assumed it was over.” It wasn’t until he was 59 and developed a rare and severe type of stone called staghorn stones, a very large type of stone which can block the entire kidney and lead to sepsis, that he began to make major lifestyle changes. “I went into hospital in excruciating pain,” he says. “Because the stones were wedged in my bladder I was constantly wetting myself, which was so embarrassing.” A few months later, surgeons removed a life-threatening 7cm stone from his kidney. “A consultant gave me lots of really helpful advice and I’ve completely changed the way I eat,” says Chafer. “I also started up an online group on Facebook for other people who suffer with stones.” He wishes he’d known about the risks sooner. “I now eat loads of vegetables, take cranberry tablets and drink lots of water. I’ve lost more than four stone, too.” Sophie Medlin, consultant dietitian and director of CityDietitians, says that another risk factor for calcium stones (also known as calcium oxalate stones) is low dairy intake, particularly among young people. Counter-intuitively, then, calcium stones can be caused by not consuming enough calcium. The National Kidney Foundation in the US recommends having three portions of dairy foods a day to prevent the formation of stones. “If you’re using plant milks, some are better than others,” Medlin says, with oat, macadamia and soy having the highest rates of calcium. Some studies also show that a vegetarian diet that includes dairy products might also be helpful. ‘I dread them returning because the pain is off the scale’ … Anne Cryer-Whitehead. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian Other foods that can contribute to calcium stones include spinach, berries, chocolate, wheat bran, nuts, beetroot, tea and rhubarb. Like Diamandis, Medlin points out that balance is key. “We shouldn’t avoid eating these foods but it’s important to consume everything in moderation.” She says that certain nutritional supplements such as greens powders, vitamin C, protein powders and turmeric also increase our risk of kidney stones. “These are all very popular supplements and are often heavily promoted on social media which, again, may contribute to increased cases of kidney stones in young people.” Alongside diet and infections, genetics play a role in the likelihood of getting kidney stones. Anne Cryer-Whitehead from Milton Keynes believes she may be genetically predisposed to stones, as they have persisted despite a healthy diet. “I first got them five years ago, when I had this excruciating pain in my back and groin,” says the 50-year-old, who is medically retired. “I ended up in hospital and they treated me with lithotripsy, which is a laser designed to break up the stones. It was so painful I could barely stand it. It felt like an elastic band being snapped against you faster and faster.” While the treatment broke up the stones, Cryer-Whitehead got an infection and was rushed back to hospital. Although she recovered, the pain returned during lockdown and she was admitted to A&amp;E. “I had a stone in both kidneys, one of which wouldn’t pass and got embedded, so I had to have emergency surgery.” Almost three years on, Cryer-Whitehead is still recovering and says the condition has drastically affected her quality of life. “I have calcium stones and I’m very cautious with my diet. I dread them returning because the pain is off the scale. I’d rather have a five-hour tattoo or go through childbirth again,” she says. Donna says the emotional distress of the condition is also vastly underestimated. “I have physically recovered from my emergency surgery, but I’m left with PTSD,” she says. “I am now back in the UK and due to see a urologist soon, but I’ve been told it’s likely that I will keep getting stones,” she says. “I don’t think many people understand how serious it can be. I just wish I’d been treated sooner.” • This article was amended on 16 May 2023. An earlier version of the main image caption incorrectly said that the kidney stone pictured was in the patient’s right kidney.</body>

    <head>I used to hide behind my hair. But cancer gave me a buzzcut and helped me find my voice</head>
    <body>There’s a saying my grandmother liked to use: little girls should be seen and not heard. I internalised that idea for much of my life, but when I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, something changed. Cancer took a great deal from me, but it gave me back my voice, and now I don’t think I’ll ever be silent again. I must have been a difficult child. Much of my childhood features people telling me to be quiet. Schoolteachers. Family members. The man who tried to rape me. The adult who, when I told her, and after having satisfied herself that nothing much had happened, decided that it would be best for me never to mention it again. At school I was labelled “dogmatic” by a teacher who liked to stare down my blouse during lessons. When I called him out, I acquired the additional label of “troublemaker”. And so I grew up believing that silence was a virtue. I became self-conscious about my voice and its effect on others. I was already more than self-conscious about the effect my appearance had on others, and did my best to mitigate this by hiding behind a curtain of hair. For a time, I forgot what it felt like to be myself, except in the safe space of the page, free from scrutiny and judgment. When my third book became unexpectedly successful, I was suddenly under more scrutiny than I’d ever known before. No more than was directed at any other successful woman, but enough to help confirm the voices of my childhood: that when you’re a woman, physical appearance is the first thing people notice; and that no one wants you to be loud, or flippant, or opinionated. My agent agreed. A grande dame in the old style, she took me in hand in a manner that brooked no refusal: decided what I should wear, what I should say, what I should write next and how best to keep out of trouble. The implication was clear: if I showed my true self, if I failed to conform to her expectations, if I spoke out about my politics – in short, if I was difficult – then something dreadful would happen. But in spite of this, somehow my voice was coming to life. It started with being a mother. My instinct to protect my child brought out my confrontational streak. I became a troublemaker again, at least in certain circumstances. But a lifetime of self-effacement takes a lot of breaking down. It took me another 20 years to learn to be myself again. By the time my agent and I parted ways, the internet had taken over as arbiter of what I should be. Women on the internet are often commented upon, told their experiences don’t count. When they push back, they receive abuse. For someone like me, raised on keeping the peace, it was sometimes tempting simply not to engage. But some events are too huge for that. The US election of Donald Trump, then Brexit, Covid, lockdown and Boris Johnson’s premiership seemed to demand some comment. On those issues, at least, I found myself growing outspoken. I got the usual abuse in response, even the occasional death threat. It was upsetting, but not as much as I’d imagined. With age comes a feeling of “fuck you”. Menopause had made me rethink my relationship with my body. Insults about my appearance made little impression on me. Even 20 years before, I’d never understood the need for strangers to see me as sexy. Then I got cancer. I spoke about that online, too, and found that others in the same situation found it comforting to hear about my experience. There was something oddly liberating in actually saying something was wrong. My old agent would have been horrified: she hid her own cancer treatment from everyone – including me – for fear of revealing weakness. I didn’t feel weak, however. I felt as if, at long last, I had taken back control. I declined the offer of a wig and opted to shave my head before chemo took my hair. Suddenly there was more to life than worrying about optics. So what if I didn’t look as people expected me to? So what if I expressed a view that made someone else despise me? I realised that I had been hiding away – under my hair, under my fear of upsetting people – all my life. Now, in the face of cancer, I felt I’d rediscovered myself. Acknowledging the effects, the fear – felt like a superpower. My scale of priorities had shifted. The dreadful thing had already happened. What was left for me to fear? I found myself engaging in discussions I would have avoided 12 months before. An angry man on Twitter lambasted me for my “woke hair”. I laughed to think he’d mistaken my chemo buzzcut for a political statement. Three years later, I’m cancer-free. My body has mostly recovered. Even my hair has begun to grow back. But the effect remains. I no longer stay silent for fear of causing trouble. Recently, I found the origin of the “seen and not heard” saying in a collection of old English proverbs by an Augustinian clergyman called John Mirk in 1450: A mayde schuld be seen, but not herd – although if Mirk already considered the proverb old, then it must have dated from long before that. Remembering his advice, I wonder what he would have said to a woman who was no longer a mayde? I like to think he learned the hard way. I like to think that some 15th-century version of me told him “fucke you”, and left him forever speechless.

    <head>People power: music, film, books and more about the madness and wisdom of crowds</head>
    <body>* * * Theatre No one does it quite like Punchdrunk. In this immense, immersive company’s hands, a crowd is entirely malleable. With the audience anonymised by masks, we can be anything they want us to be. Its current production, The Burnt City, allows us to wander around the fall of Troy, bustled together and split apart as the evening goes on. The event is less about the story and more about the scenery and our exhilarating freedom to roam within it, being at once invisible and a central part of the performance. Inviting endless curiosity in its open-world settings, Punchdrunk has set the standard for how to manage a crowd. Kate Wyver * * * Film Spanner in the works … Modern Times. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty The cinema was born out of the crowd: masses of people seeing a specific drama on a scale not imagined before. Charlie Chaplin was himself a beneficiary of the mass production of celebrity. In Modern Times, he is walking on the streets and notices a truck with a flag stuck to the planks of timber poking out of its back (a safety precaution to prevent collision). The flag falls off. Charlie picks it up and runs along behind, waving it, trying to attract the driver’s attention. Then a crowd of communist demonstrators turn the corner and happen to march up behind him, and to the cops it looks as if Charlie is the flag-waving rabble-rousing leader. He is arrested: his personal intentions were irrelevant in the wider stream of history. Charlie thought he was acting as an individual and got caught up in the crowd. Peter Bradshaw * * * Book There are plenty of wonderful crowd scenes in the novels of Charles Dickens, but in Barnaby Rudge he really lets loose, spending page after raging-and-roaring page describing the chaos of the anti-papist Gordon riots. Coincidentally, this novel was published in the same year (1841) as Charles Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds and it also helped set the tone for future thinking about seething masses of humanity. The “outrages of the mob”, he writes, are like those of a “mad monster”, “more terrible when roused” than the ocean, “more unreasonable … more cruel”. It is all frighteningly familiar, especially when Dickens shows us the demagogues and manipulators whose false accusations drive the crowds to a frenzied attack on pthe Houses of Parliament. It can feel as if he’s describing the era of Brexit and Trump as much as the events of 1780. Sam Jordison Art Bish, bash, Bosch … Christ Mocked. Photograph: The National Gallery Photographic Department/© The National Gallery, London Three’s a crowd, they say. In Christ Mocked by Hieronymus Bosch, four bullying tormentors crowd a passive, helpless innocent. They swarm him as he ignores their japes and cruelties, get in his face, enclose him, in a claustrophobic image of other people as a mob of heartless monsters. You get the feeling this is how Bosch, consumed by visions of hell and fantasies of paradise, saw the neighbours who surrounded him in the Dutch town where he lived. To his vulnerable and isolated imagination, others look like an inhuman crowd. He anticipates the nightmare crowds of Munch and Poe in this medieval and yet uneasily modern painting. Jonathan Jones * * * Music If HBO’s Euphoria has you believing that all Gen Z-ers love to party, Alessia Cara’s 2015 hit Here still stands up as an anthem for the antisocial. Under a slinky sample of Isaac Hayes’s Ike’s Rap II (also well known via Portishead’s Glory Box and Tricky’s Hell Is Round the Corner), it perfectly captures the feeling of drifting from room to room at an overcrowded house party, swerving drinks and inane conversation. “Some girl’s talking ’bout her haters / She ain’t got none.” Cara may not be impressed by what she sees, but there is a subtle fondness in how specifically she captures the rituals of teendom, letting the chaos wash over her as a rite of social passage.

    <head>PM questions migration attacks – as it happened</head>
    <body>9.37am BST What we learned, Monday 15 May That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today – thanks so much for joining us. Here is a wrap of the day’s biggest stories: The financial services minister, Stephen Jones, announced $86.5m in funding for the national anti-scams centre, which Labor pledged to create before the last election. Shine Lawyers announced it reached a $132.7m settlement with the commonwealth to end a class action against the Department of Defence over the spread of PFAS chemicals. PwC Australia has announced the former Telstra chief executive Ziggy Switkowski will lead a review of the global consultancy firm’s governance, accountability and culture. The PM and immigration minister Andrew Giles criticised opposition leader Peter Dutton for his stance on immigration. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, today began a “budget roadshow” to sell the cost-of-living measures outlined in last week’s economic statement. The Victorian government is set to drop the operator of its problem-plagued Myki system for the state’s train, tram and bus networks, with American company Conduent awarded the ticketing contract. States and territories should be given financial penalties for failing to meet housing targets, according to a new report by the Business Council of Australia. Updated at 9.40am BST 9.20am BST NSW premier says to ‘have faith’ in &apos;cutting-edge design&apos; as Sydney housing affordability turns new residents away NSW premier, Chris Minns, has said that the future of Sydney lies in focusing on higher density housing in urban areas. Speaking at the Sydney Morning Herald’s Sydney 2050 Summit earlier today, he said that housing affordability and the growing rental crisis were making it more difficult for Sydney to attract new residents, particularly young people. Forget about owning a home, it has now become impossible to even rent a home. The implications for the economy are devastating, not to mention the cultural impacts for an entire generation of young people who are saying ‘this city is not for me’.” Sydney can’t grow by adding another street to the western fringe of Sydney every week … [because] you have to stretch social infrastructure over a bigger and bigger plane. I think the best way to ensure we protect open space is to have buildings that go up. [Anti-developer sentiment] is not the reaction to how we build cities around the world. You don’t see the mayor of New York saying: ‘Manhattan is full, we have enough buildings, we’re done. Have faith that if we get the planning processes in place, and we get world-class developers, and planners … that Sydney in its totality, that we can build beautiful cities, using cutting-edge design tools. I think we can still do that. Updated at 9.38am BST 8.52am BST AAP is reporting that a woman has been rescued while the search for a man continues after the pair were reported missing from a sinking vessel in water off Queensland’s Fraser Island. Two people were on board the vessel of the northern tip of the island, also known as K’gari, when they radioed for help about 8.30pm on Sunday, police said. Police and volunteer marine services began an air and water search before rescue helicopter crews plucked the woman from the water about 11.30am on Monday. She will be airlifted to Bundaberg Hospital for treatment. The search involving multiple aircraft and vessels continues for a missing male. 8.31am BST &apos;Is he just looking for some buttons to press?&apos;: PM on Dutton&apos;s migration attacks PM Anthony Albanese has been on a lengthy AM radio interview with the ABC in Melbourne, where he defended the amount of welfare relief being given to Australia’s unemployed and again poured cold water on the idea of amending the controversial stage-three tax cuts. Albanese, on a post-budget blitz today, has already held two press conferences and a few radio interviews; so he could be forgiven for arriving at the ABC a little later than planned (your correspondent was intrigued by a lengthy talkback segment, aired in the interim, where people talked about near-death experiences). Asked about opposition leader Peter Dutton’s concerns about immigration numbers, Albanese questioned whether he was truly worried, or “is he just looking for some buttons to press?” – noting the migration figures were the same as those projected under the former Coalition government. “Peter is looking around for a sense of purpose … trying to create some issues where they shouldn’t be,” Albanese said. The PM accused his rival of “a history of intemperate remarks”, noting Dutton’s former claims that Melburnians were afraid of going out for dinner on account of a crime wave in that city several years ago. Updated at 8.40am BST 8.08am BST AAP is reporting that a man’s body has been discovered on rocks along the south-west Victorian coast two weeks after he and four friends were swept out to sea while diving. Search and Rescue Squad divers found the body at Moonlight Beach, near the Devil’s Kitchen tourist area on Monday morning, before it was retrieved by a police aircrew. The body is yet to be formally identified, but police believe it is the fifth member of a group of friends swept out to sea while diving on 30 April. Three were rescued after becoming stranded on a cliff face later that day, while a 30-year-old Sunshine North man lost his life. Police said the two-week search for the fifth man had been difficult due to poor weather conditions. Updated at 8.17am BST 7.39am BST Andrew Giles says Peter Dutton &apos;utterly incoherent&apos; on migration Immigration minister Andrew Giles was on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, celebrating the first approvals for aged care visas for a facility in Perth, but was also asked about the ongoing debate regarding increased immigration. Giles was asked if he sees a case for increasing international migration in the coming years, and began his response by taking aim at the opposition leader: I think what we’ve seen from minister Dutton is incredibly disappointing. He has been utterly incoherent in his approach to this issue, both in terms of his vast roles as the minister responsible for immigration and, indeed, as opposition leader. Last year, he was calling for us to increase the rate of migration more quickly but now he appears to be saying the opposite and doing so in divisive and regrettable language. Language that I think is unworthy of a serious debate that we need to have around immigration policy in Australia and, indeed, one that does not recognise the extent to which our migration system was broken under his watch. What we need to do is to have a migration system that operates in the national interest, in the interest of our economy and, of course, in the interest of our society. That’s what our response to the migration review is all about. Making sure that we have got settings that are fit for purpose, understand the complexities of our migration system and its interaction with some of the other almost all of the other policy aspects of government. That’s what I’m focused on. It’s very disappointing but not surprising that minister Dutton once again is seeking to divide rather than to constructively engage with this important issue. Updated at 8.12am BST 7.14am BST AAP is reporting that a strip of wetsuit material and small pieces of possibly a surfboard have been recovered as the search continues for a South Australian man attacked by a shark and feared dead. Teacher Simon Baccanello was at the back of a group of about a dozen surfers at Walkers Rock Beach on Eyre peninsula on Saturday morning when he was attacked. Efforts to find the 46-year-old over the weekend failed and resumed on Monday, with police and volunteers concentrating on areas of the coast near the location of the incident. They later reported finding what appeared to be a piece of wetsuit material and some small pieces of polystyrene that could be from a surfboard. The items will be forensically examined. Police said they would continue the search over coming days. You can read more on the story below: Related: Wetsuit material found in search for South Australian surfer feared dead in shark attack Updated at 7.21am BST 6.56am BST Richmond FC backs Indigenous voice The Richmond Tigers are the latest AFL team to back the Indigenous voice referendum, joining a growing list of clubs and sporting organisations to support the coming vote. In a tweet this afternoon, the Melbourne-based Aussie rules side came out strongly for the referendum. It comes after the Collingwood Magpies and West Coast Eagles publicly backed the vote in recent weeks. “We recognise and respect people’s right to form their own views, but the lived experience of our football club means we fully support the proposed voice to parliament and a yes vote,” Richmond said. pic.twitter.com/QYqSdcnffd — Richmond FC 🐯 (@Richmond_FC) May 15, 2023 The National Rugby League advocated for a yes vote last week. Related: NRL joins growing number of sporting codes backing Indigenous voice to parliament Both the NRL and AFL have their Indigenous rounds coming up. The NRL will hold its Indigenous round this week, while the AFL’s Sir Doug Nicholls round will feature the annual Dreamtime at the G match. Guardian Australia understands both football codes will feature referendum material in their Indigenous rounds. Updated at 7.04am BST 6.41am BST Jim Chalmers begins budget tour Elsewhere, the federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, began his charm offensive today, taking to the streets to convince people of his second budget. Chalmers will be crisscrossing the nation, speaking to business and community leaders as well as union representatives about the measures he introduced last week. Treasurer Jim Chalmers in Sydney today. Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP He began in Sydney today, and told reporters he believed it was his job to “tell more people” how the budget will be affecting them: Our budget sees people through difficult times and sets our country up for the future. It helps Australians doing it tough and makes significant inroads in cleaning up the mess we inherited from the coalition. We understand that people are under the pump. My job this week is to tell more people how our investments in the budget can help. We have a broad ambitious agenda to support the legitimate aspirations whether it’s here in north-western Sydney, or right around Australia. We support tax relief, particularly for people on low and middle incomes Updated at 6.50am BST 6.22am BST More on Peter Dutton’s ‘thought bubble’ this morning I just wanted to go back to the PM’s presser in Adelaide this morning, where he addressed the opposition’s proposal to allow people on unemployment benefits to work up to 10 hours without cutting the payment. Albanese called it a “thought bubble,” but conceded that the employment services aren’t “working to the extent that they should”: It was thought bubble from Peter Dutton. They don’t take advantage of the earning capacity which is there now to earn additional money, and then there’s a taper rate which is available. Clearly, employment services aren’t working to the extent that they should when you have an unemployment rate of just 3.5% – a historic low – but you still have people looking to work. Some of the system that’s been established by our predecessors is about ticking the boxes rather than providing that support. Updated at 6.27am BST 6.10am BST Thanks Natasha, Mostafa Rachwani with you this afternoon, to take you through the rest of the day’s news. 6.06am BST Thanks for your attention this Monday. Mostafa Rachwani now has the blog. See you tomorrow! 6.03am BST Ziggy Switkowski to lead independent review of PwC Australia PwC Australia has announced the former Telstra chief executive Ziggy Switkowski will lead a review of the global consultancy firm’s governance, accountability and culture. PwC has been accused of a “disgraceful breach of trust” after a now degregistered tax specialist shared confidential information about government policy with colleagues, who would later use it to help clients and make millions of dollars. Switkowski’s report will be completed in September with key findings and recommendations to be shared publicly to improve transparency. Here’s the statement issued by PwC a short time ago: Dr Switkowski will consider all aspects of PwC Australia’s governance, accountability and culture, including how the firm applies its professional values and ethical standards across its work. The independent review will look at the way in which decisions are made and overseen within PwC, including how financial goals, values and strategic objectives are balanced and prioritised. It will examine the way in which partners and staff are held accountable for their responsibilities, as well as assess the values and behaviours that exist at all levels within the firm., will lead a review of the consultancy firm’s governance, accountability and culture Updated at 6.06am BST 5.54am BST Greens ‘failing the public’ by blocking housing fund, PM says Circling back to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese’s, press conference in Adelaide where he accused the Greens of “failing the public” by blocking the passage of the government’s $10bn housing future fund. This is a gap that is there with the Greens political party between their rhetoric and their delivery. This is them putting politics before what is needed. You can’t say you support social housing, and then vote against it. Albanese also questioned the basis upon which the Greens aren’t supporting the bill because it relies upon a future fund: The truth is that the Greens political party would rather posture than vote for what is before the parliament. They need to explain that contradiction which is there. And I’ve seen some of their absurd comments speaking about gambling. If that is the case that setting up a fund and you use vested interests to achieve outcomes, they must be horrified at the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and what it does. They must be terrified about superannuation, which is exactly how superannuation operates for individuals in this country. And I would have thought that compulsory superannuation was something that the Greens party supported. But if you look at their rhetoric, it is just nonsense. It is just grandstanding and immaturity, and it’s why you need a party of majority government to actually be in charge, because we’re interested in outcomes, and the Greens political party seem to be just interested in playing politics. Updated at 6.01am BST 5.45am BST Those of us on the east coast won’t be putting our hot water bottles and duvets away any time soon, there’s another cold front on the way. A cold front will bring a wintery change to south-east Australia over the coming days. The front will reach western Tasmania later today and will move into the south-east states on Tuesday and Wednesday. Latest: https://t.co/4W35o8i7wJ pic.twitter.com/h8YuoVSomQ — Bureau of Meteorology, Australia (@BOM_au) May 15, 2023 5.37am BST ‘We are the caretakers of this land’, Nauo elder says Elder and native title applicant Jody Miller said the lower Eyre peninsula was a significant place for the Nauo people. She said in a statement: We are the caretakers of this land where we camp, fish, hunt, gather and share our stories that extend across Australia. This determination is the effort of over 30 years’ hard work, and we now invite pastoralists and businesses to negotiate with us regarding matters on our country. The Aboriginal affairs minister, Kyam Maher, said he was pleased the state and the Nauo people have been able to resolve the native title claim by consent. This significant step for the Nauo people, and for reconciliation in this state, is the result of many years of hard work and perseverance, and I commend the efforts of everyone involved. Updated at 5.49am BST 5.34am BST Nauo people granted native title over 8,000 sq km in SA The Nauo people have been granted native title over almost 8,000 square kilometres on South Australia’s Eyre peninsula, AAP reports. The federal court on Monday presented the traditional owners with their native title determination at a special hearing on country. It includes the towns of Palkagee, Mount Joy, Coolillie, Polda, Sheringa, Kiana, Mitchell, Kapinnie, Coulta, Wangary and Coffin Bay along with the Coffin Bay and Lincoln national parks. Updated at 5.38am BST 5.25am BST Platypus return to Royal national park for first time in 50 years When a little platypus wandered into the waters of the Sydney’s Royal national park this weekend it was the first of its species to do so in over half a century.

The search involving multiple aircraft and vessels continues for a missing male. - AAP 5.10am BST Lehrmann ‘convicted in the media before the trial started’, lawyer says Bruce Lehrmann’s lawyer has said his client was denied the presumption of innocence because it was widely accepted that Brittany Higgins, who alleged that he had raped her, was a “victim”. Steven Whybrow said he had a “problem” with Higgins being referred to as “the victim” instead of “the complainant”, as well as the optics of Higgins being accompanied to court by the victims of crime commissioner, Heidi Yates.

Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP Speaking at the ongoing inquiry into Lehrmann’s trial, Whybrow also said the ACT’s director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, stated publicly that there was “a reasonable prospect of conviction” of Lehrmann after the trial was discontinued. Lehrmann was “convicted in the media before the trial started”, he said. Lehrmann has consistently denied allegations that he raped Brittany Higgins, a colleague and fellow political staffer, in the office of the then defence industry minister, Linda Reynolds, in March 2019. He pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, denying that any sexual activity had occurred.

He says Conduent will take over from Myki’s existing operator – NTT data from 1 December, with trials of the new system to begin in 2024 before a broader rollout in 2025. He says some ticket readers – not all – will need to be replaced: We think some readers will need to be placed, particularly the most outdated one, obviously with the new technology … but we also don’t know what the future holds or indeed possesses. So we want the modern platform that will be able to use anything that may be devised or indeed innovated going forward. Updated at 5.16am BST 4.54am BST Asked why Conduent was awarded the state’s public transport ticketing contract, Carroll says: I won’t go into the detail except to say conduit offered a superior package. They were working very closely with our social enterprise sector, and above and beyond everything else, they showed that they have a very good value for money [and] more than that – a proven track record from Europe to North America and now, Australia.

Myki does have a strong brand awareness, but it will be a completely different company running the system and we will go from a card based system, where essentially all the data and all the information was located on the Myki card to an account based system where all the information is essentially downloaded from the web, and it’s a lot more quicker, and a lot more seamless. Updated at 4.59am BST 4.46am BST Carroll says there will be a two-year migration over to the new system: Your myki card will still be applicable for the next two years and slowly over the coming 12 months to 24 months you will then be able to use your credit card, your smart smartphone and digital smartwatch or any other media such as QR codes, Bluetooth devices that we are able to use on this new ticketing system.

This will be a state based system that will also incorporate V/Line, as well as our bus network and all modes of public transport. This is a very important moment for Victoria and public transport. For the past 16 years we have had a card-based ticketing system under Myki. We will now reach the 21st century, with an account based ticketing simpler and more easier to use, through your credit card, through your smartphone, through your smartwatch.

It’s very difficult to get rid of poor agents … it makes for the worst headlines and tarnishes the reputations in Australia. It needs to be sorted out. The department of home affairs employs less than 20 staff to cover more than 5,000 registered migration agents. An industry-led review taken by the former government failed to reach agreement among peak bodies after two years of deliberations. Updated at 4.49am BST 4.27am BST ‘Lots of good guys and some very bad guys’ in sector, universities say Peak bodies agree reform is needed to prevent malpractice in the international student sector but are split on what and how far. Sharon Cooke from Isana said she held large concern for the effectiveness of current regulation and loopholes were being exploited. Providers, who provide commission to educational agents, are responsible to regulate them. There needs to be greater transparency … there are educational agents and providers not using resources to develop best practices. There needs to be a shift in how education agents are treated by the regulatory bodies – best practice, not minimum standards. Universities Australia CEO Catriona Jackson said bodies had been “shocked” by reports of exploitation of international students and it had “put a cloud” over the reputation of tertiary education. International students have been so loyal and so patient and so determined [during Covid] … putting up with things you wouldn’t think are fair enough … There are lots of good guys and some very bad guys. She said a whole sector approach was needed, tying in departments and providers, but claimed the “vast majority” of problems lay outside the university sector and self regulation was working. Updated at 4.47am BST 4.20am BST Myki operator loses contract The Victorian government is set to drop the operator of its problem-plagued Myki system for the state’s train, tram and bus networks, with the Age reporting American company Conduent will be awarded the ticketing contract. Public transport minister, Ben Carroll, is expected to announce the winning bidder in its long-running tender process for the state’s ticketing system at 1.30pm. The Age has reported the government decided not to give current operator NTT Data another extension to its contract and will replace it with Conduent. Victoria first signed a $1bn contract with Kamco in 2005 to develop the Myki system and replace the paper Metcard system. It was rolled out in 2010, more than $500m over budget and behind schedule. Technical issues have persistently plagued the system. NTT Data, which bought Kamco in 2010, won a seven-year contract extension – worth $700m – in 2016. Sources have told Guardian Australia that US outfits Cubic and Conduent, French multinational Thales and Hong Kong’s MTR, as well as NTT Data, all had registered interest in the new contract. Updated at 4.59am BST 4.20am BST More criticism of Labor’s income management smartcard More on what the parliamentary committee on Labor’s new compulsory income management card has heard. Sarah Holder, of the Northern Territory Council of Social Service, said the peak body was “really disheartened” the government had “not taken this opportunity to end compulsory quarantining of welfare payments”. Holder said the legislation appeared to remove impediments that limited the minister’s ability to expand income management. Sarah Sacher, of Economic Justice Australia, said the bill would “cement” income management in “legislation and enable it to be further expanded”. Sacher said: This is not a reform bill. It is a continuation of the status quo. Labor senator Marielle Smith, who is chairing the inquiry, noted the government’s “policy intent is to move away from compulsory income management”. She said consultation was ongoing. The inquiry continues.

Two of the men, aged 32 and 20, were apprehended at Northgate in northern Brisbane about 10am on Monday and remain in police custody. The search for third man Antonio David Mene, 28, continues. Mene is described by police as being Torres Strait Islander and about 170cm tall with the outline of his last name tattooed on the inside of his right arm. He was serving three years for vehicular offences. Police have urged anyone who has seen the men not to approach him but to call triple zero. Updated at 4.16am BST 4.03am BST Brittany Higgins accused of making ‘false and misleading statements’ by chief of staff The inquiry into the handling of Bruce Lehrmann’s trial has heard that Fiona Brown – the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds’s chief of staff – accused Brittany Higgins of making “false and misleading” statements. Brown emailed Lehrmann’s lawyer, Steven Whybrow, and said Higgins’s claims that Brown offered to pay her six weeks’ wages to go to the Gold Coast during the 2022 election campaign, but that “if she went, there would be no prospect of her returning to work after the election”, was not true. Whybrow said Brown had already given evidence, and was “done and dusted” and he would have appreciated the opportunity to ask her about the context of those statements: She was done and dusted. And so there was no capacity for her to be recalled … this potentially could have been extremely important material for the defence to know about. Whybrow also denied claims from the ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, that Reynolds had allegedly been coaching him. The initial trial had heard Reynods had texted Whybrow seeking court transcripts and suggested certain texts that might be “revealing”. Reynolds denied she was trying to “coach” Whybrow and this morning Whybrow said in fact he had shown the text messages to Drumgold to show that they were above board, and that he had advised Reynolds to stick to media reports about the trial. He was trying to ensure Reynolds was doing the right thing, he said, but Drumgold used it the “opposite way”. Updated at 4.09am BST 3.54am BST Central Land Council ‘deeply concerned’ about affect of new bill on First Nations people Dr Josie Douglas, of Central Land Council (CLC), commended the government for abolishing the cashless debit card but was “deeply concerned” about new legislation that could cement income management policies that disproportionately affect First Nations people. Douglas said the CLC met last month and had reiterated its opposition to blanket broad based income management. She said the council stated, “How many times do we have to say it until the government listens to our voices?” This bill suggest that the voices of our delegates along with many other Aboriginal people and their representative organisations across the country continue to be ignored. Douglas said the CLC did not oppose the new smartcard technology for those who volunteered but said its introduction should be part of a transition to abolish compulsory income management. Douglas said a sunset clause for the bill would “bring some comfort to Aboriginal Territorians who are disproportionately impacted by compulsory income management”. Updated at 4.14am BST 3.46am BST Welfare advocates criticise Labor’s income management policies Indigenous organisations and welfare advocates have blasted a government bill they claim cements income management policies that disproportionately affect First Nations people. Labor abolished the cashless debit card – which operated in several trial sites – as part of an election promise but has kept in place income management policies in the Northern Territory, where many welfare recipients have been placed on the similar “basics card” since the Intervention. Labor maintains it is consulting on the future of income management. While this takes place, it has created a new “smart card” – similar in functionality to the cashless debit card – to replace the outdated basics card for those compelled to have their welfare payments managed in the NT and for others who volunteer. A bill being scrutinised by a parliamentary committee is intended to transition people on to the new smartcard and updates the powers given to the social services minister to set income management policies. Updated at 4.03am BST 3.34am BST Middle men ‘taking advantage’ of vulnerable international students, inquiry hears The international student experience has shifted since Covid and China’s lucrative market is questioning the viability of coming to Australia, a parliamentary inquiry into the sector has heard. Dr Angela Lehmann from the Lygon Group said the drivers for international students to come to Australia had changed since the pandemic and in China particularly, return on investment was “key”. [There are] live conversations in the Chinese market around is it worth it. A new conversation that’s come out after Covid is about new students having different ambitions towards long term permanent residency that they didn’t maybe have [before Covid]. She said diaspora communities were “taking advantage” of vulnerable offshore students by offering to act as a middle man, facilitated by social media apps such as WeChat, while education agents had also become an “important source of news” about Australia and students would be “shocked” by the rates of commission they were receiving. The lift in the cap on working rights, recently reversed by Labor, also played a factor, she said, with international students told by agents they could come to Australia and “work as much as you want”. Lisa Bolton, who directs QILT research and strategy, said international students remained “well behind” domestic students in terms of employment outcomes post study and were less likely to be in managerial and professional occupations, while also citing a drop in the overall international student experience over Covid, including a lack of engagement with staff.

Labor senator Deborah O’Neill has told a parliamentary inquiry which she is chairing the sector was potentially “rife for exploitation” and posing a reputational risk to Australia. We are having doctors breach ethics … prevention seems a critical part that’s missing … there’s incredible laxity and people who pay the price are the students as well as our international reputation. We seem so flat footed in our response to this … turning a blind eye cannot be an option. Varsha Devi Balakrishnan from the Lygon Group said obtaining visas for reputable public institutions had become a “loophole” to swap into the cheaper private sector upon arriving. They have councillors and gps that can provide letters to progress through institution swapping … we see a lot of students going down that route and having that conversation with agents prior to coming. They’re hoping Australian education will lead to an Australian work outcome but that’s where they’re finding a lot of hurdles and barriers. You get an Australian degree but you can’t put that into practice in Australia. Updated at 3.44am BST 3.19am BST International students facing fresh scams, inquiry told International students are being lured into scams and swapped from legitimate institutions into cheap VET and Tafe courses once arriving in Australia, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. International student enrolment and commencement levels have this year matched or exceeded the pre Covid levels of 2019, primarily driven by south asian countries including India, Pakistan and Nepal. Jeffrey Smart from the Lygon Group said there was “cause for concern” over the drivers for the huge spike in recent international student arrivals. I always worry when growth starts to happen very rapidly in different parts of the sector … particularly the VET sector … there is no question in our mind that some of this is going on. Smart said the accommodation crisis was intensifying as students faced new scams and struggled with the rising cost of living, across “every type of accommodation” and possibly catching up real estate agents in potential scams. Karen Sandercock from the Department of Education said the demand was mainly concentrated in the higher education sector but noted there’d been an increase in “movements” between universities and vocational providers once students arrived onshore. The inquiry heard onshore and offshore agents were collaborating to obtain student visas for legitimate universities, before using letters from counsellors or doctors to swap them into cheaper Tafe and VET degrees, gaining additional commission. Labor MP Julian Hill said “history would tell us we should be suspicious of rapidly fast growth” and question its sustainability. Those rapid growth figures do ring some alarm bells. Updated at 3.32am BST 3.13am BST Providers overseeing educational agents a ‘comprehensive’ failure, inquiry hears Labor MP Julian Hill has told a parliamentary inquiry the current approach of letting providers oversee educational agents has “comprehensively failed” and it’s not a question of whether more regulation is needed, but how. Speaking on Monday, Hill said the failures have been known by the education and home affairs departments for years and “business as usual” can’t continue. There’s been growing public concern and frustration, despair from many providers about the increasing rapacious behaviour from agents. They’re basically flogging work rights [with] obscene commissions. We’ve heard evidence of 40 to 50% commission … it’s a race to the bottom. The current approach of letting providers oversee agents has comprehensively failed. Anyone can be an agent … my dog can be an agent selling Australian education. There’s no way to kick a bad agent out … they can keep flogging the same dodgy product. Hill said he could “struggle to think of another market” where the consumer had no right to know what commission was being charged. We’ve got to break this business model of dodgy agents and dodgy providers … they’re not new topics … all of this was known by the department and put to the former government … it was the universities that scuttled the previous efforts at reform that almost got there. Hill raised a blacklist of bad agents, consistent views on standards and an agent register as immediate areas of possible reform, to happen “sooner rather than later”.

That trial was abandoned due to juror misconduct, and Lehrmann maintains his innocence. This morning his lawyer, barrister Steven Whybrow, has told the inquiry about an “ongoing battle” to obtain the so-called Moller report during Lehrmann’s trial. The Moller report, by detective superintendent Scott Moller, is critical of Higgins. ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, said he thought the report would be “crushing” to Higgins and that there was no valid reason to release it. The report was eventually released after a subpoena from the defence team. Whybrow said: I wanted to see everything the police had seen or the prosecution had access to so that we could consider it. Updated at 3.11am BST 2.52am BST NAB predicts further RBA cash rate hike by July NAB, one of Australia’s big four banks, has raised its “baseline expectation” of how high the Reserve Bank will lift its cash rate. They “pencil in” a 25 basis-point rate hike by the RBA’s July board meeting, although adding they see “some risk” the increase to 4.1% won’t come until August. Perhaps with an eye to discourage twitchy headline writers, they say: Importantly, our rate call is not a response to the recent federal budget, which we judge to be broadly neutral in terms of its effects on inflation and implications for monetary policy. Instead, they cite three reasons for returning to their February 4.1% peak forecast: “that inflation would remain well above target in the near term; that the economy was displaying considerable resilience; and that a tight labour market would continue to support a pickup in wage growth.” NAB, which joins ANZ among the big four in forecasting at least one more rate rise, says a further increase to 4.35% isn’t being ruled out. It’s worth noting that as of Friday, there was no sign that the federal budget had affected rate rise expectations one way or the other.

Albanese says while it’s a legal matter which the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, will respond to and an action which predates his election as prime minister, his concern is for the health of Australians. People have, across a range of communities, suffered from the use of this. It’s another example of where we have to get occupational health and safety right.

Updated at 2.41am BST 2.11am BST A look at the Coalition’s comments on forecast migration Let’s take stock of the comment by the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, today that “this budget does add 1.5 million immigrants … most importantly without a plan”. The budget doesn’t set this as a target or a policy as such – it outlines forecasts for “net overseas migration”. Net overseas migration is forecast to be 400,000 in 2022-23, followed by 315,000 the next year and 260,000 in each of the following three years. The Coalition has added these together to come up with the spooky “1.5 million immigrants” figure. But the budget papers explain that these figures are part of a post-pandemic catch-up and are driven by “a rapid recovery in the stock of international students, skilled temporary visa holders and working holidaymakers”. At the same time, the budget says, “very low temporary migrant arrivals during the pandemic now means fewer departures – those who did not arrive cannot now leave”: It will take more time for departures to return to normal because of the low arrivals during the pandemic. As such, the elevated forecast for net overseas migration in 2023–24 is largely driven by fewer temporary migrants departing Australia than usual, rather than a greater number of people arriving. The budget explains that the pandemic “resulted in the first net outflow of overseas migration from Australia since World War II”, and the rebound in temporary migration following the reopening of international borders “was initially slow but has recently started to recover at a faster rate”. The budget said: This has resulted in an upgrade in the forecast level of population, even though the total number of temporary migrants arriving in Australia is not expected to make up for the loss in migration during the pandemic for some time. The budget says net overseas migration forecasts reflect a “one-off catch up from the pandemic” with migration forecast to largely return to normal patterns from 2024-25. And total net overseas migration “is not expected to catch up to the level forecast prior to the pandemic until 2029–30” and the total population is still expected to be 750,000 people smaller in June 2031 compared with pre-pandemic forecasts. Updated at 2.22am BST 2.08am BST PM hails budget as ‘biggest fiscal turnaround we’ve seen’ The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking in Adelaide; he says the budget was “aimed squarely at fixing the mess that we inherited” and spruiks the budget surplus. Albanese: We inherited almost $1 trillion of debt. As a direct result of our turnaround, going from a forecast under just a year ago under Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg of $78bn deficit for this year, that’s been turned around to a forecast $4.2bn surplus. That is the biggest fiscal turnaround that we’ve seen. And today’s backing up of the increased investment in primary healthcare, we were able to achieve whilst achieving that fiscal turnaround. That’s why it was a responsible budget beginning fiscal repair, but also one that delivers what was needed for Australia at this time.

Now, we strongly believe immigration is an important part of the policy mix in this country, it’s been a huge part of the success of this nation, but it can’t be unplanned. It can’t be unplanned. What we want to see is a plan that makes sure all those complimentary things that are required for successful immigration – infrastructure investment, housing investment, the services – and there was nothing, there was nothing in this budget, that gives us any confidence that that plan is in place or will come into place any time soon.

The MV Blythe Star was travelling from Hobart to King Island on 13 October 1973, when it suddenly capsized and sank off the south-west coast of Tasmania. All 10 crew members were able to escape the sinking vessel into a life raft, but three died; the survivors were rescued 12 days later. But no trace of the vessel itself was ever found. The CSIRO said they were able to confirm the location of the ship when they were conducting a 38-day research voyage into underwater landslides off the west coast of Tasmania. It wasn’t a coincidence but a deliberate “piggyback project” using the resources already allocated for the landslide research voyage to investigate an unidentified shipwreck which had been pinpointed by fishing vessels and previous seafloor surveys in the region. The investigation showed the vessel is intact and sitting upright on the seafloor, with its bow pointing northwest. The visual inspection using the underwater cameras was able to identify key features to confirm the wreck was the MV Blythe Star. This included identifying part of the vessel name – ‘STAR’ – on the ship’s bow. CSIRO is pleased to be able to assist in providing closure to this 50-year mystery and confirm the final resting place of the MV Blythe Star. The CSIRO said the mapping and video footage gathered could also help answer questions about what caused the vessel to sink. Updated at 1.47am BST 1.21am BST Inadequate warning times ‘one of the most common complaints’ in flood-hit communities, Watt says The emergency management minister, Murray Watt, and environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, are speaking in Brisbane, officially announcing the $236m upgrade to the flood gauge network across the country we mentioned earlier. Watt says Australians devastated by the past 12 months of floods have consistently said they needed more time to prepare: I have lost count of the number of communities that I have been to since becoming the minister where one of the most common complaints we received was that people just didn’t have the warning they needed about impending flood waters to save themselves, to save their property, to save their animals … These sort of investments will go a long way to making sure that we can keep Australians much more safe into the future. Updated at 1.32am BST 1.14am BST Whitelist of authorised numbers for banks and government agencies to be compiled Jones says the final third pillar of better scam protections is ensuring consumers are better informed. The government is working on a caller ID registry, which Jones describes a “whitelist of approved numbers”. If somebody is calling you and pretending to be your bank, that call or that SMS message will be blocked. An SMS message will be blocked unless it’s coming through from the authorised number, from a bank, from a government agency, and we intend to expand that over time. Updated at 1.25am BST 1.10am BST Anti-scam centre to bring together experts from various sectors The announcement will also see “fusion cells” established, Jones says: Think of them as a hit squad. This is about getting experts together across regulators, across law enforcement, across the finance sector, telecommunications and social media platforms, bringing their expertise together for a short-term action, a hit squad, to go after a particular sort of scams. Updated at 1.22am BST 1.06am BST Anti-scam centre to share information across organisations: Jones Stephen Jones is now speaking in Canberra following that announcement of establishing an anti-scam centre. He says the policy is all about “taking the fight up to scammers.” This … announcement to establish a national anti-scam centre is about taking that fight to the scammers. .. It’s about ensuring that when reports are made, wherever they’re made, whether it’s to the national anti-scam centre, whether it’s to ASIC or state or federal police organisations, or to a bank or telecommunications company, we are sharing the information so that the people who need to know that there are scammers out there in the field are able to act on it quickly. As soon as money leaves a person’s bank account, it’s almost too late. So this is all about ensuring that we can knock the scams on the head before they get out there in the field. Updated at 1.21am BST 1.00am BST Government pledges $86.5m for national anti-scams centre The financial services minister, Stephen Jones, has announced $86.5m for of funding for the national anti-scams centre, which Labor pledged to create before the last election. Australians lost over $3bn to scams in 2022 alone, and scam losses have increased nearly five-fold since 2020. The average loss from a scam is about $20,000. The average household has about $34,000 in savings. The NASC will enable real-time information sharing on scams between law enforcement, government agencies, banks, telcos and digital platforms. Jones said: Every day, scammers are ripping money out the pockets of hard-working Australians. The government is fighting back, harnessing new technology to take on scammers in a way that has never been done in this country before. Scammers are causing devastating financial, social and psychological harm. We can’t leave Australians to fight them alone. Australia is a great destination for tourists, we want it to be the worst destination for scammers. Updated at 1.12am BST 12.50am BST BCA’s housing recommendations ‘things we’re already doing’, says minister We mentioned earlier that the business council has a new paper out this morning recommending the government incentivise states to build more houses. It proposes that jurisdictions that meet housing targets would get financial incentives, while those that don’t would be penalised for failing to meet it. But according to the housing minister, Julie Collins, “it’s things we’re already doing”. They’re doing them through the national housing accord already. I welcome support for measures we have implemented, things like changes to build-to-rent, things like changes to depreciation and working with planning ministers at the state level and state governments about improving the time it takes to get more homes on the ground right across the country. We already started that important work. Updated at 1.05am BST 12.33am BST Thailand and Turkey election results Australians are waking up to big election news out of Thailand and Turkey this morning.

He’s told AAP before his departure that the trip will be about strengthening trade ties, including in clean energy, agriculture and rugby league. There are very significant opportunities in clean energy generation itself. We should be doing what we can to assist, lowering the cost of energy, lowering emissions, taking the Pacific off diesel, which is dirty and expensive and constrains economic development in all of these countries. There’s an enormous opportunity for Australian firms to be investing in electricity generation and transmission in PNG.

It’s terrible Cheng Lei was unable to be with her children on Mother’s Day …We want these issues resolved and we want these two Australians back in our country. It’s important, I think, that at every opportunity that we get to talk to one of our counterparts in China, that we raise these issues. Updated at 11.54pm BST 11.44pm BST Trade minister will ‘persevere and persist’ in talks with China over tariffs The trade minister, Don Farrell, says he will “persevere and persist” in negotiations with Beijing to see trade tariffs removed. After returning from his trip to Beijing where he met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Wentao, he told ABC Radio: My objective in this process is to simply persevere and persist, so that at the end of the day, all of the trade impediments are removed, we’re back to a stable relationship with China and we’ve got normal trade. However, he isn’t putting a date on whether it’ll be weeks or months that those tariffs are lifted. While he says it was a “warm and friendly meeting” he says “problems aren’t solved overnight”. Updated at 11.48pm BST 11.36pm BST Current Aboriginal cultural heritage laws ‘exactly the wrong approach’: Plibersek Plibersek also reaffirmed the government is “absolutely” still committed to reforming Aboriginal cultural heritage laws. She said discussions are currently taking place to change the way decisions are made to make sure cultural heritage protection is considered at the very beginning of a proposal bieng made: At the moment, what happens a big project goes for years through environmental assessments. And at the last minute, we sort of say, ‘are there any cultural heritage implications here?’ That’s exactly the wrong approach. We should be identifying potential cultural heritage impacts from the very beginning.

On the question of amending those laws, Plibersek says the extension of the water trigger will be part of a package of environmental laws she will take to parliament at the end of this year or beginning of next year. We are committed to extending protections from – at the moment it’s coal seam gas – to other types of unconventional gas that weren’t really contemplated when those coal seam gas provisions were made.

This is a small project. It’s next to five other coalmines. It’s been a mining area for decades. It’s a project that produces metallurgical coal, which is the coal you need for steelmaking. There’s no renewable energy future that doesn’t have steel in it. … It’ll go for five years versus something like 60 years for Adani.

Corrective services officers have joined police in the hunt for Daniel Ian Badcock, 32; Osiah Pilton, 20; and Antonio David Mene, 28. (L-R) Daniel Ian Babcock, Osiah Pilton and Antonio David Mene, who absconded from Palen Creek correctional centre in Queensland on 14 May Photograph: SUPPLIED/PR IMAGE Badcock is serving a one-year sentence for possession and weapons charges. He is described as having a medium build, with a diamond tattoo on the left side of his face and the word “Omerta” tattooed over his right eye. He has other tattoos including the word “Outlaw” on his left shin and knuckle dusters tattooed on to his right hand. Pilton is described as having black hair and eyes with the word “Mum” tattooed on his left arm above the wrist, and a diamond tattoo on his left leg. Pilton was serving one year and nine months for a break and enter offence. Mene was described by police as being Torres Strait Islander, about 170cm tall with the outline of his last name tattooed on the inside of his right arm. He was serving three years for vehicular offences. Police have urged anyone who has seen the men not to approach them but to call triple zero. Updated at 1.22am BST 10.58pm BST NSW next in line for flood warning system improvements, Plibersek says As mentioned, the government is prioritising Queensland in those updates to the flood gauges. Plibersek says that’s because the Queensland state government was “particularly keen” on the partnership, but that NSW will be next because both states were identified by the Bureau of Meteorology as facing the greatest flood risk. Sadly, three-quarters of the deaths that have happened in flooding in recent years have been in Queensland and New South Wales, and about three-quarters of the economic cost of flooding has been in Queensland and New South Wales. The Queensland government were particularly keen to partner with us and we’re looking at rolling out to New South Wales, we hope, next, and other high-risk flood areas over coming years. Updated at 11.04pm BST 10.53pm BST The environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, is giving more details about that flood warning system, speaking to ABC Radio: We need to be able to read them remotely, particularly [in] dangerous times. … The better the flood gauges, the more warning we can give to communities and to emergency services personnel about approaching flood waters. Plibersek says the aim of updating the gauges would be to give people more warning; one of the biggest criticisms from the 2022 Lismore floods was the inadequacy of the warnings people were given. Updated at 11.01pm BST 10.49pm BST Flood warning system upgrades worth $236m to prioritise Queensland Queensland will be given the highest priority in a new federal government program to upgrade flood warning systems, while other states will also be pressed to share the costs. In the budget last Tuesday, the Albanese government announced it would provide $236m over 10 years to fix high-priority flood warning infrastructure. Under the program, the Bureau of Meteorology will “acquire, upgrade and integrate local and state government-owned rain and river gauges into its existing flood warning network”. The government today announced more details about the program: Based on the advice of the Bureau of Meteorology, work in Queensland will be prioritised. This is due to the high flood risk to the community in Australia’s most disaster-prone state and the Queensland government’s prior commitment to share the cost of ongoing operations of the flood gauge network. The government’s statement said the federal funding would “ensure high priority catchment upgrades can begin in every state and territory across Australia, if successful cost sharing arrangements are agreed to”. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said severe weather events, including floods, were becoming more extreme and more frequent, and people needed access to the best available information in real time. The emergency management minister, Murray Watt, said the Coalition had “ignored calls to show national leadership and upgrade and maintain flood gauges in high-risk communities”. The government is also working on phone alert emergency warning systems, as Josh Butler reported recently: Related: Australians in disaster zones to receive phone alerts to improve emergency response Updated at 10.54pm BST 10.43pm BST Opposition accuses Don Farrell of returning from China trip empty-handed The Coalition has accused the trade minister, Don Farrell, of coming back from China empty-handed. Farrell said after talks with the Chinese commerce minister, Wang Wentao, in Beijing late on Friday that he was “very pleased to confirm that we agreed to step up dialogue … to resolve our outstanding issues”. But there were no concrete announcements of breakthroughs for particular sectors that are still suffering from steep tariffs or other restrictions, including Australian wine and seafood. The Nationals MP Kevin Hogan, who is the shadow trade minister, expressed “deep disappointment that the trade minister’s visit to China has not delivered any relief from China’s punitive, unfair, and illegal trade sanctions on Australia exports”. Hogan said in a statement: I publicly supported the trade minister’s visit to China as a positive step in the trade relationship thaw but nevertheless, join the many exporters who are disappointed that it delivered no dividend in sanction relief. Despite the diplomatic dispute reaching its peak in 2020, Hogan said the Coalition government at the time had “never wanted to stop talking to the Chinese government”. China effectively banned high-level talks shortly after the Morrison government’s call for a Covid origins inquiry.

Speaking to ABC News this morning after the $10bn housing future fund bill was blocked when parliament met last week, Collins said: I would say to Liberal senators and Greens senators: we took this to the last election, we’re trying to legislate it and they should get out of the way, because there’s so many people in Australia today relying on those homes. There’s too many Australians doing it tough that need us to get on with the job. Updated at 10.46pm BST 10.38pm BST Business council report urges penalties for not meeting housing targets States and territories should be given financial penalties for failing to meet housing targets, according to a proposal by business groups. A new report by the Business Council of Australia has recommended national housing targets should be tied to population growth forecasts. The report said the targets should then lead to actions state or territory governments could take to meet demand. Under the proposal, jurisdictions that met housing targets would get financial incentives, while those that didn’t would be penalised for failing to meet it. The report said: This will provide a direct link, with specific incentives and penalties, between the forecast growth of the nation, which is in part controlled by the federal government, and the net additional dwelling targets set by states and territories. This should take into consideration both greenfield and infill development. – AAP Updated at 10.41pm BST 10.38pm BST Treasurer kicks off budget roadshow The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today begin a “budget roadshow” to sell the cost-of-living measures outlined in last week’s economic statement. Chalmers will launch his post-budget week tour in Sydney and expects to visit five cities in five days. The agenda includes meetings with locals, business representatives and unions, along with several budget-related speeches. The government says the focus of the budget roadshow this week will be promoting the $14.6bn cost-of-living package. Chalmers will also declare that making Australia a renewable energy superpower is a core part of the government’s plan for growth. The budget roadshow follows Coalition attacks that the budget “didn’t see much for middle Australia” and that the “working poor” are struggling to get by in a high-inflation environment. Chalmers said the government understood that people were “under the pump” given the cost of living pressures: My job this week is to tell more people how our investments in the budget can help. Whether it’s our energy rebates, bulk billing incentives or our energy efficiency package, I’ll travel right across Australia this week – including from Brisbane to Bennelong, and South Australia to Swan – to explain the broad-based benefits that our budget delivers. Updated at 10.39pm BST 10.38pm BST Good morning! The Business Council of Australia believes states and territories should be given financial penalties for failing to meet housing targets. A new report by the council has recommended national housing targets be tied to population growth forecasts, and comes as the government’s housing fund is stuck in parliament. The Coalition have accused the housing fund of being inflationary, while the Greens do not believe the government’s scheme goes far enough. In Sydney, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today begin his post-budget week tour and expects to visit five cities in five days to sell the cost-of-living measures outlined in last week’s economic statement.

Meanwhile, the assistant trade minister, Tim Ayres, is heading to Papua New Guinea. He is leading a delegation of Australian businesses to strengthen trade ties, including in clean energy, agriculture and rugby league. Queenslanders can expect to see better flood warning systems, with the state being given the highest priority in a new federal government upgrade programs.

    <head>Inquiry into Menindee ‘catastrophic fish deaths’ to consider ways to prevent future ecological disasters</head>
    <body>An independent inquiry into the deaths of millions of fish in the Darling-Baaka River at Menindee in March will look at whether local management interventions could prevent future fish kills. The terms of reference for the inquiry, which was announced last month, were released on Monday. They include an investigation of the environmental conditions and water monitoring data in the lead up to the fish kill, the success of the emergency management framework which saw New South Wales Police as the lead agency responding to an ecological and public health disaster and whether there was sufficient community consultation, particularly with First Nations people. The NSW water minister, Rose Jackson, told reporters it was essential to understand why the “catastrophic fish deaths” occurred and prevent a recurrence. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter “We are requesting this independent inquiry to provide the community with certainty that we are thoroughly investigating this matter,” she said. The review will be conducted by the NSW chief scientist and engineer, Prof Hugh Durrant-Whyte. The NSW environment minister, Penny Sharpe, visited Menindee with premier Chris Minns after the state election last month. She told reporters on Monday it was important that they visit the region as soon as possible “to understand how big it is”. “On the day that we’d visited, they had removed over 10,000 tonnes of dead fish from the local waterways there,” she said. Related: Castle in the cane fields: exploring Queensland’s most unusual tourist destination “The local community has been talking about the challenges of water management along the Darling-Baaka for a very long time. They really feel like they haven’t been listened to, and one of our commitments and today’s announcement really is about delivering that commitment to them. “Not only will we get to the bottom of what happened with the fish deaths, the actions that led up to it, the role of the agencies, the way in which they communicate with the community. But we also want to get to the bottom of what we can do in the future to prevent them.” “We need to get this right and we look forward to the chief scientist helping us along the way.” Prof Durrant-Whyte said his office would be conducting a broad-ranging inquiry. “There is no doubt the extraordinary number of fish deaths has had a far-reaching effect on western NSW and beyond,” he said.

    <head>GPs aiding international student agents to exploit Australian visa ‘loophole’, inquiry hears</head>
    <body>Labor has vowed to crack down on the unregulated world of international education agents after revelations that general practitioners may be involved in student recruitment schemes. Foreign agents have been used by Australian universities for decades to drive enrolments and assist students offshore with application processes and accommodation. Agents have been accused of luring international students with false promises of full-time work and a path to permanent residency while receiving huge bonuses from private providers with poor course outcomes. Related: Lack of pregnancy care for international students in Australia may lead to ‘reluctant abortions’, inquiry told On Monday, a parliamentary inquiry heard counsellors and GPs were helping onshore and offshore agents engage in “institution swapping”, allowing agents to earn additional commission. Once agents secured students visas at prestigious universities, the agents engaged medical professionals to provide medical certificates supporting their move to alternative cheap private providers. International students must be approved from release from their institution if they wish to swap providers within six months, and illness or distressing events are included in the possible grounds for changing institutions. Varsha Devi Balakrishnan from international education specialists the Lygon Group told the inquiry agents used a “loophole” to secure visas at reputable public institutions before moving students on to cheap providers, sometimes more than once. “They have counsellors and GPs that can provide letters to progress through institution swapping … we see a lot of students going down that route and having that conversation with agents prior to coming,” she said. “They’re hoping Australian education will lead to an Australian work outcome but that’s where they’re finding a lot of hurdles and barriers.” Chair of the committee senator Deborah O’Neill said the international education sector, previously described as a “ponzi scheme”, was ripe for exploitation and posed a reputational risk to Australia. An industry-led review undertaken by the former government failed to reach agreement among peak bodies after two years of deliberations. “There was a lot of talk but when difficult decisions needed to be made and care needed to be taken to make sure there weren’t gross and exploitative profits being made at the cost of international students, the work that needed to be done wasn’t done,” O’Neill said. O’Neill said there wasn’t a “timetable formalised” for reform but the government and committee understood it “wasn’t something to be delayed”. “We need careful, considered governance and change not left for another couple of years,” she said. Dr Angela Lehmann, also from the Lygon Group, told the inquiry there had been instances of diaspora communities “taking advantage” of vulnerable offshore students before they’d even arrived in Australia, including through social media apps such as WeChat. She said students would be “shocked” by the rates of commission agents were receiving, cited as being as high as 50% of fees. Work restrictions for student visa holders, which were relaxed throughout the pandemic also played a factor, she said, with international students being told by agents they could come to Australia and “work as much as you want”. Labor has announced it will reintroduce restrictions. Peak bodies agreed reform was needed to prevent malpractice but were split on the best route to take. Universities Australia CEO Catriona Jackson said she was “shocked” by reports of exploitation of international students and it had “put a cloud” over the reputation of tertiary education. Related: Australians who lost welfare under 1990s student loan scheme have cause for class action, expert says “There are lots of good guys and some very bad guys,” she said. She said a whole sector approach was needed, tying in departments and providers, but claimed the “vast majority” of problems lay outside the university sector and that the current self regulation approach was working. O’Neill said the notion the current system was working “doesn’t sit with the evidence”. “Someone’s making money somewhere, and it’s not the students,” she said. “There can be a shadow economy that exists that operates out of unprofessional incentives. It’s wrong and at odds with ethical demands.” Robert Parsonson, executive officer of the International Student Education Agents Association said the sector was “severely lacking accountability” and there was “no cross talk” between providers and departments. The Department of Home Affairs employs less than 20 staff to cover more than 5,000 registered trading officers. International student enrolment and commencement levels have this year matched or exceeded 2019, primarily driven by south Asian countries including India, Pakistan and Nepal. Labor MP Julian Hill told the inquiry “history would tell us we should be suspicious of rapidly fast growth” and question its sustainability. “Those rapid growth figures do ring some alarm bells,” he said.</body>

    <head>S Club 7 to continue tour following death of Paul Cattermole and departure of Hannah Spearritt</head>
    <body>S Club 7 have said they will continue with their forthcoming tour of the UK and Ireland after the death of Paul Cattermole in April and the subsequent departure of Hannah Spearritt. In an emotional video posted to Instagram, the remaining five-piece, officially known as S Club, said the tour would be renamed Good Times in tribute to Cattermole, who sang lead vocals on the song. The band members paid tribute to their late bandmate, who died on 6 April, with Bradley McIntosh saying they were in “disbelief” about losing their “big brother”. “No one could ever replace our Paul, but he lives on inside each and every one of us,” he said. Rachel Stevens said: “He’s always going to be with us. He was such a big part of this tour, so involved in everything that we are planning. And we are just going to keep his memory alive and share it with all of you and it’s going to make it even more special.” Jon Lee added: “You’ve probably noticed that there’s only five of us here today, and although Hannah will always be part of S Club 7 she won’t be joining us on this tour. We wish her all the best for the future. However, the five of us are really excited and geared up.” The Guardian has contacted representatives for Spearritt for comment. In April, Spearritt paid tribute to Cattermole in an interview with the Sun. The pair were previously in a romantic relationship during the band’s 00s heyday – with Spearritt describing Cattermole as her “first love” – and subsequently for a period around 2015. “I am grateful to have had that time with him, to make peace with each other,” Spearritt said. “Because I know that’s all we both ever wanted. To have had that opportunity to see him, and to see him well, unfortunately, he didn’t get to do the tour. He was just so excited for the tour.” Related: Paul Cattermole was the endearing wild card in S Club 7’s peppy pop pack | Michael Cragg After Cattermole’s death in April, the band released a statement describing themselves as “truly devastated by the passing of our brother Paul. There are no words to describe the deep sadness and loss we all feel. We were so lucky to have had him in our lives and are thankful for the amazing memories we have.” The Good Times tour commences in October. It was to be the first time that all seven members of the teen-pop band had shared a stage in eight years. S Club 7 were formed by the former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller in 1997 and launched via the CBBC show Miami 7 in 1999. They released four albums and achieved four UK No 1 singles.</body>

    <head>The apocalypse isn’t coming. We must resist cynicism and fear about AI</head>
    <body>In the field of artificial intelligence, doomerism is as natural as an echo. Every development in the field, or to be more precise every development that the public notices, immediately generates an apocalyptic reaction. The fear is natural enough; it comes partly from the lizard-brain part of us that resists whatever is new and strange, and partly from the movies, which have instructed us, for a century, that artificial intelligence will take the form of an angry god that wants to destroy all humanity. The recent public letter calling for a six-month ban on AI lab work will not have the slightest measurable effect on the development of artificial intelligence, it goes without saying. But it has changed the conversation: every discussion about artificial intelligence must begin with the possibility of total human extinction. It’s silly and, worse, it’s an alibi, a distraction from the real dangers technology presents. The most important thing to remember about tech doomerism in general is that it’s a form of advertising, a species of hype The most important thing to remember about tech doomerism in general is that it’s a form of advertising, a species of hype. Remember when WeWork was going to end commercial real estate? Remember when crypto was going to lead to the abolition of central banks? Remember when the metaverse was going to end meeting people in real life? Silicon Valley uses apocalypse for marketing purposes: they tell you their tech is going to end the world to show you how important they are. I have been working with and reporting on AI since 2017, which is prehistoric in this field. During that time, I have heard, from intelligent sources who were usually reliable, that the trucking industry was about to end, that China was in possession of a trillion-parameter natural language processing AI with superhuman intelligence. I have heard geniuses – bona fide geniuses – declare that medical schools should no longer teach radiology because it would all be automated soon. One of the reasons AI doomerism bores me is that it’s become familiar – I’ve heard it all before. To stay sane, I have had to abide by twin principles: I don’t believe it until I see it. Once I see it, I believe it. Many of the most important engineers in the field indulge in AI doomerism; this is unquestionably true. But one of the defining features of our time is that the engineers – who do not, in my experience, have even the faintest education in the humanities or even recognize that society and culture are worthy of study – simply have no idea how their inventions interact with the world. One of the most prominent signatories of the open letter was Elon Musk, an early investor in OpenAI. He is brilliant at technology. But if you want to know how little he understands about people and their relationships to technology, go on Twitter for five minutes. Not that there aren’t real causes of worry when it comes to AI; it’s just that they’re almost always about something other than AI. The biggest anxiety – that an artificial general intelligence is about to take over the world – doesn’t even qualify as science fiction. That fear is religious. Computers do not have will. Algorithms are a series of instructions. The properties that emerge in the “emergent properties” of artificial intelligence have to be discovered and established by human beings. The anthropomorphization of statistical pattern-matching machinery is storytelling; it’s a movie playing in the collective mind, nothing more. Turning off ChatGPT isn’t murder. Engineers who hire lawyers for their chatbots are every bit as ridiculous as they sound. The much more real anxieties – brought up by the more substantial critics of artificial intelligence – are that AI will super-charge misinformation and will lead to the hollowing out of the middle class by the process of automation. Do I really need to point out that both of these problems predate artificial intelligence by decades, and are political rather than technological? AI might well make it slightly easier to generate fake content, but the problem of misinformation has never been generation but dissemination. The political space is already saturated with fraud and it’s hard to see how AI could make it much worse. In the first quarter of 2019, Facebook had to remove 2.2bn fake profiles; AI had nothing to do with it. The response to the degradation of our information networks – from government and from the social media industry – has been a massive shrug, a bunch of antiquated talk about the first amendment. Regulating AI is enormously problematic; it involves trying to fathom the unfathomable and make the inherently opaque transparent. But we already know, and have known for over a decade, about the social consequences of social media algorithms. We don’t have to fantasize or predict the effects of Instagram. The research is consistent and established: that technology is associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety and self-harm among children. Yet we do nothing. Vague talk about slowing down AI doesn’t solve anything; a concrete plan to regulate social media might. Related: Another warning about the AI apocalypse? I don’t buy it | Ivana Bartoletti As for the hollowing out of the middle class, inequality in the United States reached the highest level since 1774 back in 2012. AI may not be the problem. The problem may be the foundational economic order AI is entering. Again, vague talk about an AI apocalypse is a convenient way to avoid talking about the self-consumption of capitalism and the extremely hard choices that self-consumption presents. The way you can tell that doomerism is just more hype is that its solutions are always terminally vague. The open letter called for a six-month ban. What, exactly, do they imagine will happen over those six months? The engineers won’t think about AI? The developers won’t figure out ways to use it? Doomerism likes its crises numinous, preferably unsolvable. AI fits the bill. Recently, I used AI to write a novella: The Death of an Author. I won’t say that the experience wasn’t unsettling. It was quite weird, actually. It felt like I managed to get an alien to write, an alien that is the sum total of our language. The novella itself has, to me anyway, a hypnotic but removed power – inhuman language that makes sense. But the experience didn’t make me afraid. It awed me. Let’s reside in the awe for a moment, just a moment, before we go to the fear. If we have to think through AI by way of the movies, can we at least do Star Trek instead of Terminator 2? Something strange has appeared in the sky – let’s be a little more Jean-Luc Picard and a little less Klingon in our response. The truth about AI is that nobody – not the engineers who have created it, not the developers converting it into products – understands fully what it is, never mind what its consequences will be. Let’s get a sense of what this alien is before we blow it out of the sky. Maybe it’s beautiful. Stephen Marche is a Canadian essayist and novelist.

    <head>Give customers a fair deal or else, finance regulator warns sector</head>
    <body>New rules, taking effect in just over two months, aim to ensure that people are treated better by the companies from which they get their mortgages, current accounts, insurance and other financial products. Banks, building societies, insurers, investment firms, and many other businesses have been warned they must be ready for one of the biggest-ever shake-ups of consumer finance in the UK. The new regime, from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), will see the introduction on 31 July of the so-called “consumer duty,” which sets higher, clearer standards of protection, and explicitly requires companies to “put customers’ needs first”. This could mean being told about better interest rates on a mortgage available to you if you are coming to the end of a fixed deal, or halting unreasonable exit fees, which stop people from leaving a financial product to go to a better one. The drive is aimed at producing what the FCA calls “good outcomes” for consumers: reduced call-waiting times, an end to rip-off charges and fees through clearer promotions, and making it easier to cancel or switch investments. And last week, Sheldon Mills of the FCA warned firms which ignore the new rules that they faced swift action where there was risk of harm to consumers. “In some cases firms can expect us to take robust action, such as interventions or investigations, along with possible disciplinary sanctions,” he said. Tim Hogg, at consultants Oxera, says the new rules are among the biggest reforms of financial regulation in the last 15 years. “I hope, when it comes to buying new products, it’s less of a head-scratcher for people in terms of what is the right one for them.” Pressure on consumers The FCA says it wants consumers’ needs to be put first and for there to be a higher level of consumer protection in the retail financial markets. This is at a time when people are under financial strain because of the cost of living crisis, and are being forced to make complex decisions when taking out mortgages, loans and other products. Some financial firms present information which is confusing, or difficult to understand, making life more difficult, which can result in people buying products that are not right for them or do not offer good value, says the regulator. I hope, when it comes to buying new products, it’s less of a head-scratcher for people in terms of what is right for them Tim Hogg, at consultants Oxera Under the consumer duty, it will be up to firms to stop practices that are not in the best interest of their clients. The changes will affect the 52 million who use financial services in the UK. How it will work It is unlikely consumers will see a complete change in how they deal with their mortgage provider or insurance company come 1 August. Rather, this will happen over time, says Andrew Strange at accountants PwC. There will not be a list of what can and cannot be done for the thousands of processes involved. But consumers will be able to complain if they feel they are not being well served. Some examples of how this might happen include: • A consumer may have a financial product which has a large exit fee if they want to switch to one with better rates. Or it could be that a customer would have to physically go into a branch to cancel. These would both breach the new rules, says the FCA. • Where there is a life insurance policy that pays out if a customer develops a medical condition, and subsequently has a life expectancy of less than 12 months. They may find it difficult to navigate the claims process when they are clearly vulnerable, or there could be complications in getting a payout. The FCA has told firms they would need to ensure they tell people about any limits with the policy and avoid “foreseeable harm”. • So-called packaged bank accounts may have additional features such as travel insurance attached, but the customer may be unlikely to use them. • Or bank accounts which are sold with the daily cost of the overdraft advertised, rather than the “significant cumulative cost”. Both would fall foul of the new rules. Hogg says the duty will ensure people are getting the right product at a fair price. “Another way of thinking about it would be: if you were to sit down with a consumer after they bought a product, and talk them through exactly what happened and read out the T&amp;Cs, would they ever say ‘I regret that’? It is trying to embed that regret test in how the industry operates.” If someone, after coming off a good fixed-rate mortgage deal, was put on to a variable rate but did not switch to a better deal. “I hope what will happen is that providers take more action to identify people who are suffering from inertia and not switching on to the cheapest rate for them,” says Hogg. Strange says that in the case of a person suffering a death in the family and needing money from their bank account, the bank may be expected to waive exit fees. If you have a problem If consumers have trouble with how a financial services firm is dealing with them, they must first complain to the firm, which has a duty to look into that complaint. And then, if the consumer is not happy with the response they receive, they can go to the Financial Ombudsman Service. It says it “welcomes the consumer duty, as this will raise standards so that consumers are better protected and can make good financial decisions. “We will continue to work closely with the FCA to ensure a consistent and complementary approach to the application of the new rules, while respecting the different statutory roles we deliver”.</body>

    <head>Portrait of Kaye review – at home with an agoraphobe, in gently affectionate study</head>
    <body>‘Oh fiddle faddle,” mutters Kaye Mannion in the front room of her house in Hackney, east London. Kaye is a cheerful soul in her mid-70s, a chatterbox, an extrovert. She also happens to be agoraphobic; and has been since she was a teenager. In this documentary about her life, Kaye comes over like Miss Havisham crossed with the mother and daughter Edies from Grey Gardens, with a bit of Carry On thrown in. She’s what you might call a character, and the film’s director Ben Reed – one of Kaye’s neighbours – take enormous care in his gentle, affectionate film not to make fun of her or exploit her eccentricities. And sensibly, he keeps the running time to a tight 59 minutes. Kaye lives in the Victorian terrace she grew up in – long before the gentrification added a few zeros to house prices in the area. Everything is preserved exactly as it was in the 1960s and 70s, down to the floral wallpaper in the front room, and ceiling painted raspberry pink. The place is shabby and rammed with knickknacks, the walls covered with pictures of movie stars and crooners of a certain vintage. When Kaye married a milkman in the 1960s, there was no question of her leaving home – he moved in with her, and her mum and dad. All are now dead. So Kaye lives with her memories, many of them hoarded on home movies (shot on blank VHS videos her dad used to buy her from Woolworths). Clearly, Kaye is creative, and perhaps in another life she might have been a film-maker or an artist. But here she is, a curator of her past. And there is something so tender about how precious her childhood is to her; nothing gets thrown away. (She hoots with laughter at the dull entries in her teenage diary: “I did a lovely big load of washing.”) Reed doesn’t pry too much into Kaye’s phobias or mental health, or a supposed relationship with a younger man called Lorenzo after the death of her husband. Still, there is a delicious sense of bohemian freedom Kaye has enjoyed, living alone in her later years, including taking topless pictures of herself à la Babs Windsor. What a delight. • Portrait of Kaye is available from 19 May on True Story.</body>

    <head>The Happy Couple by Naoise Dolan review – less love triangle, more sex pentangle</head>
    <body>Among the many complaints from why-oh-whying critics about last month’s Granta list of best young British novelists (sorry if you’re sick of the subject) was the absence of the Irish writers Naoise Dolan, Michael Magee and Sally Rooney. While historians probably have a better word for that kind of inclusivity, the slightly bizarre consensus could also be seen as an uncomplicated tribute to the fact that so many of the best recent novels in English have come from Ireland. One of them was Dolan’s debut, Exciting Times, a tart comedy about a millennial Dubliner caught up in a bisexual love triangle while teaching English in Hong Kong. Her new novel, set largely in present-day Dublin, confirms her talent while giving cause for regret that she’s shed a few spikes since her first outing, although it’s hardly a shock to find the title isn’t to be taken at face value. The couple in question are mid-to-late twentysomethings Celine, a concert pianist, and Luke, a PR guy for a global tech company. He’s a serial shagger who craves approval but doesn’t know what to do with it, while she’s independent-minded and dedicated to her art yet somehow unable to contemplate life alone. We join them just when – in a typically convincing exchange – they’ve suddenly talked themselves into getting hitched because neither can face breaking up. The bed-hopping is neither transgressive nor redemptive but simply a fact of life We follow them from this awkward engagement to the big day via five points of view: theirs as well as Celine’s sister, Phoebe, and Luke’s Oxford pals Archie and Vivian, both of whom he’s slept with. En route there’s abundant shilly shallying about whether marriage is actually what the central characters want, though both circle the question – even after Luke goes awol from his own engagement party, only to be tracked down in a hotel bar several G&amp;Ts deep with Celine’s ex Maria. That alone has potential to sink the relationship, but The Happy Couple’s energy consists largely in making you want to shake the characters into more sensible decisions. Hate the game, not the players, Dolan seems to say, putting society in the dock. One of the chapters in Celine’s portion of the narration breaks off into a summary of all the culture she’s been exposed to; up to age 12, we’re told, she read 378 books “where women date or marry men”, and none “where women date or marry women”. The segment ends: “She’s not an idiot. She’s just been carefully taught.” Even Luke, drafting his wedding speech the night before while still undecided whether he’s going to turn up, asks himself why Celine hasn’t already called it off: “Answer: heteronormativity is a near-ubiquitous form of mania.” Like the novels of Rooney and another Irish writer, Niamh Campbell (We Were Young), Dolan’s narratives are casually bisexual, cracking open marriage-plot narratives – less love triangle, more sex pentangle – with bed-hopping that’s neither transgressive nor redemptive but simply a fact of life. There’s a political frisson to that, for sure, but also a certain frictionlessness, at least in this novel, which brings the unpalatable thought that what’s good for life – shame, begone – isn’t always great for fiction. But maybe millennial Irish fiction seeks its guilt elsewhere anyhow; you can hear an echo of the anxiety driving Rooney’s Beautiful World, Where Are You when Luke sulks that his fiancee’s art depends on workers living “in conditions ranging from breadline to slavery so Celine can play the piano”. The send-up is implicit – what we’re witnessing most of all is Luke’s ludicrous talent for self-exculpation – but in the end, this is a warm and sympathetic novel, ready to let even its worst offenders off the hook. The problem is that where the moment above lands with psychological crunch, Dolan more often uses her wit simply to parcel out insights and provocations among her cast rather than using them to build personalities we really care about. Even the novel’s form – ever ready to break into a cute numbered list or a series of three- and four-word chapters – comes to seem like corner-cutting. Funny and direct, it nonetheless leaves you with not a lot; at least we enjoy the ride, which most of the time seems to be more than the characters can say. • The Happy Couple by Naoise Dolan is published by W&amp;N (£16.99).

    <head>Labor’s cashless welfare bill criticised as disproportionately affecting First Nations people</head>
    <body>Indigenous organisations and welfare advocates have blasted a government bill they say cements controversial cashless welfare policies that disproportionately affect First Nations people. Labor abolished the cashless debit card that operated in several trial sites but has kept income management in the Northern Territory, where about 20,000 mostly Indigenous welfare recipients are forced on to the “basics card”. The government has said it is consulting on the future of income management policies that date back to the NT intervention with a view to making them voluntary. In the meantime, it has created a new “smartcard” – similar to the cashless debit card – to replace the “outdated” basics card. A bill being scrutinised by parliament transitions people on to the smartcard and hands powers to the social services minister to set income management policies. Related: Australia’s cashless debit card to become voluntary from 4 October, Labor says On Monday, the committee heard strong criticism of the bill from the Central Land Council (CLC), the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory (Apont) and the Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation. Dr Josie Douglas of the CLC said the council was “deeply concerned” about the new legislation. Douglas said the CLC met last month and reiterated its opposition to broad-based income management programs. “How many times do we have to say it until the government listens to our voices?” Douglas said. “This bill suggests that the voices of our delegates along with many other Aboriginal people and their representative organisations across the country continue to be ignored.” Douglas said the CLC did not oppose the new smartcard technology for those who volunteer to have it but she said its introduction should be part of a transition to abolish compulsory income management. Critics, including the Greens, claim the bill could see Labor – or a future Coalition government – further expand income management policies. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The inquiry heard concerns the bill handed expansion powers to the minister without a clear timeline for the end of compulsory income management. The bill does not include a “sunset clause” that would lapse income management programs unless they were extended by parliament, as occurred under the cashless debit card. Douglas said a sunset clause would “bring some comfort to Aboriginal Territorians who are disproportionately impacted by compulsory income management”. Income management involves the quarantining of a proportion of welfare payments on to a debit card that cannot be used to withdraw cash or purchase alcohol or gaming products. While Labor’s pledge to scrap the cashless debit card received significant attention during the election, its First Nations election policy platform also pledged to make other income management programs voluntary. The Labor senator Marielle Smith, who is chairing the inquiry, noted the government’s “policy intent is to move away from compulsory income management”. She said there was ongoing consultation with communities on this question. While there is limited academic evidence in support of the card, supporters told the inquiry its removal has worsened the situation in their communities. Patrick Hill, president of the Shire of Laverton in Western Australia, said severe social issues including domestic violence and alcohol abuse had worsened since the card was withdrawn. Hill said the card had to be compulsory because those who needed it would not volunteer. Peter Craig, president of the WA Shire of Leonora, said local emergency services had reported an increase in hospital admissions. Asked to respond to the criticism from Indigenous organisations, Hill said politicians had “tried everything” else and the card, though imperfect, had been effective. Craig read a letter to the committee from a local Aboriginal elder who he said supported the card. Related: Allowing Indigenous man early access to pension could have ‘enormous’ consequences, court hears The mayors clashed with the independent Indigenous senator Lidia Thorpe, who suggested their support for compulsory income management was discriminatory – claims they strongly rejected. Australian National University Prof Matthew Gray, who was involved in a study of income management policies introduced through the NT intervention, said he was “horrified” by the legislation. He said the evidence showed broad-based income management policies had failed. A University of Adelaide report, one of several commissioned by the Coalition, was inconclusive about whether the cashless debit card had reduced social harms, while the auditor general also lashed the former government for continuing it with little evidence. Under questioning by the Greens senator Janet Rice, the Department of Social Services confirmed the bill would allow the minister to expand income management without legislation. Patrick Boneham, from the social services department, said the clause was not “new” and simply replicated powers from past income management legislation. He said any expansion could be disallowed by the Senate. The Coalition, including the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has attacked the government for abolishing the cashless debit card.</body>

    <head>Risk assessments used to justify Australia’s post-sentence terrorism detentions need urgent research, report finds</head>
    <body>A new report has warned risk assessment tools being used to justify extraordinary post-sentence terror detention powers require urgent, independent research and validation. The Australian Institute of Criminology on Friday released a report prepared for the department of home affairs on the use of four risk assessment tools, which are designed to gauge the threat posed by radicalised offenders and, in some cases, justify them being held behind bars or closely supervised after their sentences have been served. The AIC report found there was a “relative lack of research into the efficacy of these tools”, something it found was a “barrier to their use and undermines confidence in expert assessments that rely on these tools”. Related: Lawyers outraged by government failure to disclose terrorism-prediction tool’s serious problems “Further independent research and validation studies are urgently required,” the report said. The report examined four tools: the violent extremism risk assessment version 2 revised (Vera-2R), the terrorist radicalisation assessment protocol-18 (Trap-18), the radar and the extremist risk guide 22+. Each tool focusses on assessing slightly different aspects of a person’s likelihood to radicalise and attempts to measure the risk of different outcomes among different types of individuals. It found two tools, Vera-2R and the ERG 22+, were the most suitable of the four and that the Vera-2R tool can continue to be used to justify post-detention orders, but must be “subjected to further scrutiny and, in particular, validation”. The report recommended that they only be used alongside a “clear acknowledgement and communication that risk assessment tools in themselves are not predictive of the likelihood of violent extremism”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “In reviewing the literature on violent extremism risk assessment, and undertaking interviews with experts in the field, it was immediately clear that there is a paucity of information on the efficacy of these risk assessments,” the AIC report said. “While some, such as the TRAP-18, have been the subject of a larger body of research, there is exceptionally little research supporting the validity of others, including the VERA-2R. “Pivotally, where research is undertaken into these risk assessment tools, it has almost universally been authored by the creators of those tools, or the colleagues of the tool developers.” “This presents a significant issue for the field of violent extremism risk assessment. Further, there is little evidence that these tools are accurate.” The report said the Vera-2R tool remains the most suitable risk assessment tool to use when seeking post-sentence detention or supervision of individuals. But it said “it should continue to be used, in conjunction with other suitable tools as appropriate, but it must be subjected to further scrutiny and, in particular, validation”. Related: Legal Aid lawyers kept in the dark over damning report on terror risk assessment tool The AIC report follows a more exhaustive study, commissioned by the Morrison government, which examined the reliability, validity and equity of risk assessment tools, conducted by academics Dr Emily Corner and Dr Helen Taylor. That report similarly cautioned government about the lack of evidence for their use. “The lack of evidence underpinning both instruments has potentially serious implications for their validity and reliability,” the report found. “Without a strong theoretical and empirical basis for factor inclusion, it is not reasonable to anticipate that the instruments are able to predict their specified risk with anything other than chance.” The government received the report, known as the Corner report, in May 2020, but did not disclose it to defendants who were being targeted with post-sentence orders. The commonwealth used the powers 14 times after receiving the Corner report. It also failed to disclose the report to the New South Wales government, which was also using the risk assessment tools to help justify post-sentence orders. The lack of disclosure of the report has prompted an angry response from lawyers representing those targeted with post-sentence orders. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor earlier this year criticised the lack of disclosure while recommending an end to Australia’s continuing detention order powers.</body>

    <head>NBA conference finals predictions: will Jokić halt LeBron’s title ambitions?</head>
    <body>Western Conference finals: Los Angeles Lakers v Denver Nuggets What the Lakers need to do: Defend. When these teams met in the conference finals in the bubble in 2020, the Lakers won the series in just five games, holding Denver to 109.2 points per contest. They may have to do even better this time as the Nuggets boast perhaps the best player on Earth, Nikola Jokić, winner of two of the past three NBA MVP awards. Thankfully for LA, they have maybe the greatest defender on Earth in Anthony Davis. In the 2020 championship run, Davis’ long arms altered countless shots and he’ll have to do the same here. The problem for the Lakers is that Jokić is even better than he was three years ago, capable of scoring from anywhere and dishing dazzling assists. Against the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference semi-finals, the Lakers held the Warriors and Stephen Curry to under 100 points in Game 3, and an average of 109.8 points per game in the six total contests. They’ll have to keep that pressure up against Denver. When the Lakers emerged victorious against Golden State, a relieved James said he and his team have a “lot of respect” for the Nuggets. And both teams will have a handful of days off between winning their semi-finals series and Game 1 in Denver on Tuesday. Rest will be important for the Lakers, especially if they want to keep their streak alive of winning Game 1 on the road and snatching home-court advantage from their higher-seeded foes, just as they did in the opening round against Memphis and later against the Warriors. Key player for the Lakers: LeBron is still the King, but the Lakers’ best player is clearly now Davis, with his condor-like wingspan and ability to affect the game at both ends of the court. He can check guards and block shots at the rim on defense and attack the paint with the ball. But the series will probably come down to “the others,” as Shaquille O’Neal often calls a squad’s role players. Undrafted wing Austin Reaves has been the team’s third-best player over the past several months and guards Dennis Schröder and D’Angelo Russell have provided important scoring pop. Everyone will need to be on their A-game if they’re to survive Jokić. What the Nuggets need to do: Stay calm. Sure, they’re a (relatively) small-town team. And sure LA is glitzy, with stars like Jack Nicholson and Michael B Jordan in the crowd. But the rims are still 10ft tall, and the court is still 94ft by 50ft. While Denver are a so-so defensive team, their star player can do it all on offense – and he’ll have to. When the Warriors had success against the Lakers, it came from drawing Davis away from the basket. Jokić can do so in spades, orchestrating from the top of the three-point arc. Combine his talents with the skilled supporting cast of point guard Jamal Murray, forward Aaron Gordon, shooter Michael Porter Jr and Swiss army knife Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and the Nuggets have more than enough to make it to the NBA finals for the first time in franchise history. Key player for the Nuggets: The Nuggets’ starting five are excellent. They have size, scoring, experience, continuity and talent to boot. So, let’s look at the team’s reserves – specifically, the three players likely to come off the bench in any close game: versatile forward Jeff Green, slashing guard Bruce Brown Jr and promising rookie Christian Braun. Yes, Jokić is always No 1 when it comes to Denver. But without great bench play while the starters rest, Denver will be heading home sooner than they hoped. Prediction: Given that the Lakers revamped their franchise to such a massive degree this year, it’s hard to glean any insight from the teams’ head-to-head battles during the regular season. But with two hungry rosters and two former MVPs, this should be a close one. The edge, however, has to go to James, who’s just been here too many times before. Lakers in 6. Eastern Conference finals: Miami Heat v Boston Celtics Jimmy Butler reserves his best performances for the playoffs. Photograph: Nathaniel S Butler/NBAE/Getty Images What the Heat need to do: Everything starts with Jimmy Butler. He is the straw that stirs the drink with his drives to the basket, dogged defense and ability to draw fouls. Aside from Butler, the Heat’s other ace in the hole is their coach, Erik Spoelstra. He may be the best tactician in the game, capable of turning a slight advantage into one that could decide a series. The Heat grind out games, and the Celtics are well aware of that, having faced Miami last year in the conference finals, going to seven games and barely winning after a missed Butler buzzer-beater that still lives in the minds of their fans. While the Heat are the No 8 seed, they believe they are on Boston’s level. With the unflappable Bam Adebayo and Kyle Lowry, along with shooters Max Strus and Duncan Robinson, Miami have a great chance to advance if they stay disciplined. Key player for the Heat: While Butler remains the biggest name for Miami, it will be hard for the Heat to win through without strong shooting from distance. Miami will surely look to muck the game up with fouls, rugged play and every other trick Spoelstra can muster. But they will need to hang with Boston’s big-time scorers in order to advance. As such, Robinson and Strus must hit shots often, both to put up points and to create the court space for Butler to operate. What the Celtics need to do: Remember who they are. It’s strange, Boston somehow tend to forget that they may be the best team in the NBA and certainly the best remaining squad in these playoffs. Do they get bored? The team’s two stars, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, are complemented by the excellent Al Horford, Robert Williams and Marcus Smart: many would argue the only NBA team that can beat the Celtics are the Celtics. If the team get lackadaisical or lose confidence, Miami will attack like a piranha crossed with a pitbull and there will be no tomorrow. Indeed, the series will be won and lost between the ears for Boston and their playoff tested roster. Key player for Boston: The key figure for Boston won’t be on the court. Instead, it’s the rookie 34-year-old head coach, Joe Mazzulla, who replaced Ime Udoka amid a storm of controversy. The youthful play-caller is somehow two years younger than the team’s starting center, Horford. Will Coach Mazz be outwitted by Coach Spo, who already boasts two championship rings from the LeBron-Wade era? Or will he rise to the challenge? Mazzulla has already recently been called out by Smart. But Mazz and his team responded in Sunday’s Game 7 against Philly, outscoring the 76ers 33-10 in the third quarter. It will be up to Boston’s coach to make sure the team stay rooted in their identity: a killer one-two punch with a talented supporting cast. Prediction: While the “Zombie Heat,” as Bill Simmons calls them, just won’t go away, Boston are far more talented top-to-bottom than the squad from South Beach. They should take care of business in the series and meet the Lakers in the finals for the 13th time in history, each team hoping to earn their 18th title banner. Celtics in 6.</body>

    <head>China jails US citizen for life on espionage charges</head>
    <body>A Chinese court has sentenced a 78-year-old US citizen to life in prison on espionage charges. John Shing Wan Leung, a Hong Kong permanent resident, was detained in April 2021 by Chinese security services. His sentence was announced on Monday by the Suzhou intermediate people’s court on its public WeChat account. No further information about his trial or charges were listed. Leung’s sentence also included deprivation of political rights for life, and confiscation of personal property in the amount of 500,000 yuan. There are no previous reports or notices of Leung’s arrest or trial. Espionage cases in China are treated with almost no transparency, with trials often conducted in secret and long delays between convictions and sentencing. China’s justice system also regularly reports a conviction rate above 99%. This month, amendments to China’s anti-espionage law came into force, broadening its scope and increasing the risk to foreign individuals and organisations operating in the country, according to observers. It is not clear what Leung is accused of. Leung, whose Hong Kong and US ID numbers were published by the court, was born in Hong Kong, and was chair of the Texas branch of the Association for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China (APPRC), according to Hong Kong media. The Guardian has not independently confirmed his identity. Related: China ‘barring thousands of citizens and foreigners from leaving country’ National and state level APPRCs operate around the world, promoting Beijing’s claim over Taiwan and its plans for what it terms “reunification”. They are believed to be connected to the Chinese Communist party’s united front work department, a global influence operation. In October 2020, the then US secretary of state Mike Pompeo designated the Washington DC-based National Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (NACPU) as a united front work department. The website of the NACPU, which says it was founded in the 1970s, also refers to itself as the Association for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification. It describes its purpose as fostering cross-straight relations, uniting overseas Chinese, and to “adhere to the one-China principle and oppose all words and deeds that split China’s territory and sovereignty”. “It is feasible to study the unification of China plan, and strive for the final and complete reunification of China,” it said. In 2015, the man Hong Kong media has identified as Leung was also reported to have funded eye surgeries for 60 rural Chinese children, through the Guangming hospital. State media and government releases in recent years have also praised his commitment to furthering US-China ties, and working with multiple Chinese overseas cultural organisations and the united front department. The NACPU has been contacted for comment. Additional research by Chi Hui Lin</body>

    <head>To my friend who worries about becoming a parent: here are some things to hold on to</head>
    <body>I decided to write this column in the format of a letter. I wanted to set myself the writing challenge of citing some of the many positive things about having a baby without being saccharine, resorting to cliche or generalising, and the only way I could find was this way. It’s addressed to one person, but I hope that those who find themselves at a similar crossroads take succour from it. To my friend A, When you sidled up to me at a party recently and confessed that you wanted to have a baby, we were both drunk. So when you said that you needed reassurance that it wouldn’t be awful, because all you ever seem to hear about parenthood is negative, I probably didn’t give you what you needed that night. I’ve been mulling over what you said ever since. I read somewhere not long ago that children ruin your life. I do not feel this (I was at a party, for a start). You create a new life in that child, and with that baby, you get a new life, too. I look back on my old self with fondness, and a little indulgence. She had a lot of fun, but it was time for a new adventure. A baby is more than just an adventure, though: you’re embarking on an epic quest that will hopefully see them safely into adulthood. We hear a lot about the obstacles we meet on the way and less about the wonders we encounter, so I wanted to say that: you will experience wonder the likes of which you can’t imagine now. The wonder seems mundane to other people, of course, and that’s part of the problem. For example: my baby is doing this thing at the moment where he has started kissing his favourite characters in the books we read. Every time he does it I feel a soaring happiness that feels almost criminal, like I’m getting away with something. What I’m saying is that you can spend your whole life trying to be happy, taking up wild swimming or yoga or microdosing LSD or having therapy, but, for me, nothing has come close to the feeling of watching my child launch himself at a drawing of a fluorescent pink simian who has just learned the importance of saying sorry to an elephant with hurt feelings. It’s not just your happiness, either: it’s theirs. Giving your baby a lovely day feels genuinely fulfilling for you, but less selfishly, joy has been created for them, and the amount of happiness on this planet has increased. It may be by a tiny amount, in a global context, but to that child, it is everything. Another one of those cliches is that it’s “a love unlike any other” – a nonsense, because no love is like any other. What I will say is that it’s a love that feels primal and molecular. It has a before, and an after. Before I felt this love, I could imagine it, because like most humans I am capable of empathy, but I had not lived with it. The life I had before I got to feel this love feels like less of a life. That is not to say that I believe people who are not parents live less meaningful lives. I don’t, at all. But my life has greater meaning to me, for loving him. And of course, his life has meaning. He exists! It still feels wild and miraculous that this should be the case, and not just because it wasn’t the easiest birth (try not to worry about the birth. We usually hear the horror stories, and they are important, but good births happen, too). Becoming a mother – and giving birth – has enhanced my feelings of solidarity with other women. It is a solidarity that is physical, intellectual, emotional and political. It is also historical. I feel empathy with women who lived and died many centuries before I even existed. And that has expanded my heart and my mind. When I became a mother, it was as though all the mothers in my life, even peripherally, received some sort of alert signal, and rallied. Even the mothers of friends of mine, whom I rarely see, sent gifts and messages. Other mothers brought meals or gave breastfeeding support or medical advice. Their well wishes, guidance and care held me in an embrace that lasted for many months after the birth. My own mother’s embrace, and my father’s, not to mention my extended family’s, have kept me going. Related: No woman should have to give birth alone. Pregnant asylum seekers need our support | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett We are used to hearing about how motherhood limits and constricts your life, less so about how it can expand it. A world of other mothers – other parents, actually – has revealed itself to me. I have always believed that life is fundamentally about human relationships, and having a baby has enhanced mine. I love my husband more than ever. Parenting has also allowed me to experience childhood again. I always wanted to give someone else a childhood. My wide-eyed little boy is at the stage where he is simply in love with the world, and that love is thrillingly unconditional (he is beside himself every time he sees a pigeon). It is a privilege to witness, and it makes me determined to maintain it for him as much as I am able, because his laugh is the best sound that I have ever heard. A note about sleep: you will be OK – you’ve had enough wild nights to know you can cope. And you can get your body back, whatever that might mean to you. I feel I have (ish). As for your career, it’s normal to worry. I speak only for myself when I say that I wish I had spent less time fretting beforehand about how I would write. I have far less time, now, but I’m still writing. Even a paragraph a day adds up to a novel, eventually. There is so much untapped joy, hilarity and love there waiting for you, and I hope I’ve given you a small glimpse of some of it to hold on to.

    <head>The targeting of Epsom is open to debate – but the right to peaceful protest is not</head>
    <body>All human life is present and cheerfully incorrect in William Powell Frith’s famous painting The Derby Day. Lords and ladies, rakes and scoundrels, circus performers and card sharps, high society and lowlifes and everything in between, all cheek-by-jowl at one of the very few events in Victorian Britain at which the classes mingled with relative freedom. If Frith were to return to Epsom for the Derby next month, 167 years since the one he initially sketched in 1856, he would still find a rich assortment of characters both in the grandstands and roaming free on the Hill – with, in all likelihood, one new addition. The pink T-shirted activists from the recently-formed group Animal Rising, some of whom delayed the start of the Grand National by 15 minutes last month and also staged anti-racing protests at Ayr and Doncaster in recent weeks, are long odds-on to have Epsom on their target list too. Related: Military Order marches to Epsom with stylish triumph in Derby trial Animal Rising’s opposition to the use of animals for any human purpose or form of entertainment is absolute. It allows for no nuance or argument, or any appreciation of, say, the differences between an industry that breeds and rears animals for slaughter, and one that breeds and rears them to race. Every month in Britain last year, almost a million pigs were slaughtered for meat – and an average of four racehorses sustained fatal injuries while racing on the Flat, or around one for every 1,250 starts. And without the sport that created the thoroughbred breed in the first place, it would soon be extinct, because racing is what they are born and bred to do. From the activists’ point of view, however, these distinctions are irrelevant. Protest and disruption at a showpiece event like the Grand National or Derby will garner far more publicity than a sit-in outside an abattoir. And Epsom on Derby day is, by its very nature and tradition, arguably the most obvious open goal in the whole sporting calendar for activists planning non-violent direct action. Alongside major events like the FA Cup final, Wimbledon and the Open golf championship, the Derby is an annual fixture that needs no introduction. Unlike those other sporting crown jewels, however, anyone can turn up with a picnic and watch the Derby for free. Even with a couple of weeks’ notice of protests at the Grand National, it ultimately proved impossible to secure Aintree entirely. Epsom, with its Hill enclosure which is and always has been free to enter, is a whole new level of wide open. And even with the FA Cup final stomping on to its turf on 3 June – thanks for that, Fifa and Qatar – the attention of millions both in the UK and around the world will still be on Epsom for the two and a half minutes it takes to run the world’s most famous Classic. Some form of protest or disruption may well be inevitable on Derby day, a prospect that the sport’s professionals and fans have greeted with a range of emotions, from fury to frustration and occasionally a side order of bemusement too. It is entirely possible to be a racing fan and care deeply about animal cruelty, the climate crisis and inequality. As it did when Frith painted Derby day, racing still draws fans from across the social and political spectrum. The Morning Star – “for peace and Socialism” – still has a racing column for a reason. Animal Rising activists are apprehended by police as they invade the race course at Ayr. Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA So it could also be something to bear in mind that opposition to horse racing is nothing new. There will always be a minority in any British population that objects to its existence, and it would be a strange state of affairs if there was not. Even in the days when parliament held an annual debate on whether it should adjourn for Derby day – before voting, overwhelmingly, that it should – Sir Wilfrid Lawson, the radical Liberal MP for Carlisle, always provided robust opposition to the motion. “It is all nonsense,” Lawson told the house in 1880. “Do not tell me they run horses for sport. If all these noblemen and gentlemen ran for nothing but sport, there would be no stakes and no added money. I say that the whole system of racing is an organised system of rascality and roguery from beginning to end.” Chepstow 1.30 Bantry 2.05 Vidi Vici 2.40 Peachey Carnehan 3.15 Rich Rhythm 3.50 Moveonup 4.25 Ivy Avenue 4.55 Sympathise Newcastle 1.40 Special Rate 2.15 Fourth Of July 2.50 Starlyte 3.25 Marshalled 4.00 Deluxe Range 4.35 Magic Mike 5.10 Red Vision 5.45 Tommy Time Beverley 1.50 Rowayeh 2.25 Bombay Bazaar 3.00 Montelusa 3.35 Gustav Graves 4.10 Jazz Samba 4.45 Blueflagflyinghigh 5.20 Book Of Tales Wetherby 4.50 Marroof 5.25 Gold Guy 6.00 Platinum Girl 6.30 Al Baahy 7.00 Morning Sun 7.30 Bert Kibbler 8.05 Swinging Eddie 8.40 Premiership Sandown 5.40 Miss Mach One 6.15 Enochdhu (nb) 6.45 Finn’s Charm 7.15 Artistic Star 7.45 If Not Now 8.20 Gert Lush (nap) It is only fair to note that in 1892, 45 years after the House first voted to adjourn for the Derby, Lawson finally won the debate – 144 Ayes, 158 Noes – and the tradition that the parliament would always rise for Epsom was no more. Nearly a century and a half later, however, racing is still with us, and so too are its opponents. Infuriating and baffling though it is to many racing fans, and outnumbered 1,000-to-one as they will probably be by spectators at the Derby, Royal Ascot and elsewhere, Animal Rising’s activists are likely to be around for some time to come. The group is not, of itself, an existential threat to racing, nor is it ever likely to be. Football now dominates the British sporting landscape as the turf once did, but racing remains one of the country’s most popular spectator sports, turning over billions of pounds annually, shifting millions of tickets and keeping around 80,000 people in full-time employment. But it is precisely because of the Derby’s history and enduring popularity that it will be such a tempting target for protest. If it did not still pull in an audience of millions from Britain and around the world, Animal Rising would surely look elsewhere. And personally, much as I enjoy horse racing and want to see it thrive, I want to live in a country with a meaningful right to peaceful protest – about racing, the monarchy, climate change or anything else – a great deal more.</body>

    <head>Why Trump’s ‘vile’ attacks against Carroll after verdict could be ‘chilling for survivors’</head>
    <body>After a New York jury found Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing the advice columnist E Jean Carroll, sexual violence advocacy groups and experts are having mixed responses to the verdict, particularly in light of Trump’s public attacks against the decision and Carroll, and as top Republicans have rushed to his defense. Related: Trump rages after sexual abuse verdict but legal woes have only just begun Despite the verdict and the jury awarding about $5m in compensatory and punitive damages to Carroll, Trump and a handful of Republican lawmakers have remained defiant: a move which sexual violence experts have condemned as risking re-traumatizing survivors. But at the same time they have hailed Carroll’s victory as holding to account one of the most powerful men in the world. As Carroll launched her suit in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the trial has been seen as a validation – not just of her own quest for justice – but of a broader search for accountability for those who have been sexually abused. The symbolism of the jury’s decision was powerful and could be inspirational for others to take action. “This case highlights the importance of opening retrospective windows for survivors to come forward … It elevates how difficult it is to heal and attempt to pursue justice … Sexual violence is a deep trauma that takes time to heal and opening a retrospective window is reflective of that fact,” Tamika Payne, the acting director of the New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault, told the Guardian. “These windows are just the first step in addressing a realistic timeframe for survivors to come forward,” she added, making a point to note that New York’s recent Adult Survivors Act, which opened a one-year window for survivors whose statute of limitations has expired to file a civil lawsuit, expires in November. Laura Palumbo, a spokesperson for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, echoed similar sentiments. “We hope [this case] can bring hope to survivors that it is possible for the truth to be heard even years after the assault has happened … Common challenges that we see survivors have … [include] … the way that trauma impacts the brain and how it can affect the level of detail and information they are able to recall about the assault,” Palumbo explained. “It is really impactful to see that a survivor’s story and experience was heard and believed in this way,” she continued.

This case demonstrates that all perpetrators, no matter how powerful, can and will be held accountable.” Anne Coughlin, a law professor at the University of Virginia specializing in criminal law, rape and feminist jurisprudence, hailed the verdict as a victory but also noted the chilling effect that Trump’s response may have on survivors. “One can construe the verdict as a triumph for the rule of law – after a public trial, a jury found one of the most powerful men in the world responsible for sexual assault – and as a vindication of the right of women to be free from forced sex. The verdict sends the message that, contrary to Trump’s remarks on the Access Hollywood tape, celebrity men cannot ‘do anything’ to women,” Coughlin told the Guardian. “But the run-up to the trial, the trial itself, and the aftermath are going to be chilling for survivors … [Carroll] is not the garden-variety survivor … in terms of the amount of support, clout and credibility that she was able to bring to the trial,” she said. “Trump’s intransigence after the verdict, his vile comments about Carroll at the CNN Town Hall, and his supporters’ gleeful rejection of the significance of the verdict – all of these things may send a message to survivors about how costly it is for them to speak up and seek justice,” added Coughlin. Trump’s intransigence … may send a message to survivors about how costly it is for them to speak up and seek justice Anne Coughlin Following the verdict, Trump lashed out on his social media platform Truth Social, writing: “I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. This verdict is a disgrace – a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time!” Meanwhile, a handful of Republican lawmakers have thrown their support behind Trump. Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee condemned the verdict as the latest act in the “legal circus” surrounding Trump, telling Fox News: “I think we’ve seen President Trump under attack since before he became president … This has been going on for years. He’s been amazing in his ability to weather these sorts of attacks and the American public has been amazing in their support through it.” The Florida senator Marco Rubio said: “That jury’s a joke, the whole case is a joke,” while the Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin said that he believed it was “very difficult” for Trump to get a fair trial “in any of these liberal states”, Politico reports. Others appeared to dismiss the gravity of the case, with former vice-president Mike Pence saying:, “It’s just one more story focusing on my former running mate that I know is a great fascination to members of the national media, but I just don’t think it’s where the American people are focused.” Sexual advocacy groups have condemned Trump’s denials and his Republican defenders, calling them dangerous and belittling to survivors. “To say sexual violence is a horrific crime and we need all these resources, but then for there not to be a similar outrage when the response is how it is, is gaslighting,” Payne told the Guardian. “Any form of sexual violence is the most intrusive, traumatizing violation that a person can experience and to politicize it diminishes the trauma that it is. And is one of the reasons that so many survivors choose not to report, not to seek civil remedies. Their response directly contributes to the stigma and silence that survivors endure,” she said. Similarly, Palumbo criticized the politicization of Carroll’s trial and explained the silencing effect it may have on others. “Even if there are a lot of focal supporters of them or a decision is in their favor, they can face a lot of public criticism, threats of harm … and that has such a silencing effect for other survivors. “When a survivor’s story and experience is politicized in this way, our society takes away their voice and their power,” said Palumbo. “It is very retraumatizing for survivors of sexual assault to hear other survivors be discredited … We as a society have to think about how we are responding to those survivors in public and private ways,” she said. On Thursday, Carroll’s lawyers said that she may sue Trump for a third time after his “disgusting, vile, foul” comments about her on CNN. Meanwhile, Trump’s lawyers have filed an appeal against the $5m judgment awarded to Carroll. With the legal battle between Carroll and Trump showing no signs of winding down anytime soon, Coughlin remains concerned about the efficacy of the law in protecting survivors. In response to a question about what further legal steps should be taken in the case, Coughlin told the Guardian: “This question assumes that law is the institution that can bring about the cultural changes necessary to protect women against sexual violence. Law cannot do that work alone, no way. To be sure, survivors must continue to report and bring cases, and, where appropriate, prosecutors must pursue criminal charges vigorously. But the whole point of the #MeToo movement is that the law has failed and is continuing to fail survivors. And the reactions to the verdict in the Carroll case show that we still have a ways to go.”</body>

    <head>‘Everything is possible’: Nottingham Forest draw fire in fight for survival</head>
    <body>Shortly after the final whistle had blown on a cool Saturday afternoon at Stamford Bridge, Nottingham Forest’s players walked over to their supporters and formed a mutual show of appreciation. It was also a mutual show of belief. Yes Forest could, and probably should, have won, but in that moment there was a clear, collective understanding that a point at Chelsea – even this Chelsea – is not to be sniffed at and may well prove crucial in this tightest of relegation scraps. A 2-2 draw combined with the one at Elland Road a few hours earlier meant Forest ended the day as they had started it – 16th and three points above the bottom three. A small cushion but a cushion nevertheless and with only two games remaining this season the maths has become simple for Steve Cooper’s side – one more victory all but secures safety. Hence the rousing, raucous love-in down by the Shed End and talk afterwards from Serge Aurier and Taiwo Awoniyi of Arsenal’s visit on Saturday and the final‑day trip to Crystal Palace being akin to cup finals. Related: Leeds dig out draw to deny Newcastle after Callum Wilson’s penalty double For Aurier it is very much a case of get the job done as quickly as possible, in other words: beat Arsenal. “They fight for the Premier League and we fight to stay in the Premier League and for us it’s a big final because if we win we are [virtually] safe,” said the Ivorian full-back. “So it’s really important for everyone to stay calm. We do the job here, now we rest and then we prepare for the game [against Arsenal]. If we play with the same mentality, fight and stick together then everything is possible.” That Forest find themselves in this position is somewhat remarkable given it was less than a month ago that they hit a 11-game winless run that sunk them to 19th and going nowhere except straight back to the Championship. There followed a surprise win against Brighton but that was followed immediately by defeat at Brentford via two goals conceded in the final 12 minutes of the contest. It was a devastating setback and, really, that should have been that – but instead Forest have responded superbly, following up a gutsy 4-3 victory against Southampton with the draw on Saturday. Lined-up in a 5-2-2-1 formation, the visitors’ intention was clear – defend in a crowded low block and use that as the platform for swift, incisive counterattacks. And the gameplan largely worked, with Forest having only 24% possession but finishing with a higher XG than Chelsea, 1.30 compared to 1.17, and, crucially, just as many goals. Serge Aurier battles for possession with Chelsea’s Lewis Hall. The Ivory Coast full-back praised his team’s mentality after their 2-2 draw. Photograph: Ian Tuttle/Shutterstock In that regard there is little denying Awoniyi was Forest’s standout performer, the Nigerian scoring with two well-taken headers either side of two well‑taken strikes by Raheem Sterling to make it nine goals in all competitions this season, with four of those coming in the space of six days. The 25-year-old former Liverpool forward, signed from Union Berlin for £17m in the summer, really is an excellent target man; muscular, athletic, aggressive, smart with his movement, technically secure and clinical. He’s also crucial to this way of playing for Forest; their out ball as well as sharp end. “We missed him when he got injured [for three months with a groin strain],” said Aurier, “but now he’s back and we need to keep him in the team.” Everyone in the visitors’ ranks played their part at the weekend and it was, as Aurier intimated, their mentality, fight and togetherness that most significantly contributed to what was only Forest’s seventh away point of the campaign. And they will need to again display those qualities in order to get something against an Arsenal side that are likely to be intent on getting back to winning ways and restoring pride following their heavy defeat to Brighton on Sunday. As Aurier put it: “We must defend together and attack together if we want to stay in the Premier League.” As good as Forest were against Chelsea, they still conceded twice for a seventh time in eight games, a level of defensive frailty that will have Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus in particular licking their lips. Equally, Mikel Arteta’s men will have to cope with what is sure to be a rip-roaring atmosphere at the City Ground. “We know we have amazing fans and at home we feel it even more,” Aurier said just before reacting with a big grin and a hearty chuckle upon being asked what it would mean to him as a former Tottenham player to beat Arsenal, an outcome that would end their championship dreams once and for all. The sense of anticipation is clear – Forest’s next game is not only their biggest of the season, it could also be the most special.</body>

    <head>A House Republican wants to prove Biden is compromised – but where’s the evidence?</head>
    <body>“This is a very serious investigation,” James Comer, chairman of the US House of Representatives’ oversight committee, told the rightwing channel Newsmax recently. “The allegations and the things that we’re investigating make Watergate look like jaywalking.” Related: ‘It’s going to be dirty’: Republicans gear up for attack on Hunter Biden The Watergate scandal needed a whistleblower, John Dean, to bring down Richard Nixon half a century ago. Republican Comer claims that he, too, has a “highly credible” whistleblower who will provide evidence that Joe Biden has been compromised by a foreign power. Such a monumental allegation from such a senior politician would once have been front page news. Even if Republicans were assumed to have partisan motivations, many observers would have begun with the premise that there is no smoke without fire. However, Republicans’ embrace of Donald Trump and his bogus conspiracy theories has turned the default response in Washington to one of skepticism. With the identity of the whistleblower still shrouded in mystery, the burden of proof falls on Comer – and he is yet to deliver. Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist, said: “We should always take the whistleblowers seriously, but this committee, at least so far, is cheapening the use of whistleblowers because they keep saying that they have found all this evidence for a whistleblower, and I think they even mentioned they might have more. But where is it?” Comer has previously been rebuked by Democratic colleagues for exaggerating the number of whistleblowers that his investigation has. He took his latest claim to national television earlier this month. Appearing on Hannity on the rightwing Fox News network, he said a whistleblower had provided Congress information raising concerns that, during Biden’s vice- presidency under Barack Obama between 2009 and 2017, he was allegedly engaged in a bribery scheme with a foreign national.

We find it very credible. We have a lot of questions about whether the FBI even looked into this.” In a fundraising email to supporters, the House oversight committee chairman added: “It is with a heavy heart that I fear our Commander-in-Chief may be compromised by foreign actors, and I’m going to do everything in my power to deliver the whole truth to the American people.” In a letter that used the word “alleged” three times in the opening paragraph, Comer issued a subpoena to FBI director Christopher Wray for a document that, according to the whistleblower, “describes an alleged criminal scheme” involving Biden and a foreign national “relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions” when Biden was vice-president and includes “a precise description” about it. But the FBI this week declined to provide the document. Christopher Dunham, acting assistant director for the FBI’s office of congressional affairs, wrote in a letter to Comer: “The mere existence of such a document would establish little beyond the fact that a confidential human source provided information and the FBI recorded it. “Indeed, the FBI regularly receives information from sources with significant potential biases, motivations, and knowledge, including drug traffickers, members of organized crime, or even terrorists.” Comer has also said he obtained thousands of pages of financial records showing that at least nine members of the Biden family – including the president’s son, Hunter, and brother, James – allegedly exploited the Biden name in their business dealings by accepting money from foreign nationals in China and Romania. The oversight committee chairman followed up with an eagerly hyped press conference this week, stating in an interim report that some Biden family members, associates and their companies received more than $10m from foreign entities between 2015 and 2017. The reality is we don’t even have a scandal here, much less Watergate David Brock Hunter, a lawyer, received more than $1m from a company controlled by Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu, who was the subject of a criminal investigation and prosecution for corruption in Romania. But the financial records showed no evidence that Biden himself acted improperly or took any official action because of his family’s business affairs. Nor, despite the claims of “influence peddling”, did they demonstrate actual wrongdoing by the Biden family. The press conference was widely ignored or panned. David Brock, president of Facts First USA, a non-profit watchdog, said afterwards: “The reality is we don’t even have a scandal here, much less Watergate.” Humiliatingly, Comer was even given a rough ride on Fox News. Host Steve Doocy told the Kentucky congressman: “You don’t actually have any facts to that point. You’ve got some circumstantial evidence. And the other thing is, of all those names, the one person who didn’t profit is that – there’s no evidence that Joe Biden did anything illegally.” Republicans are under pressure to deliver after winning the House majority last year and promising to use their subpoena power to investigate foreign entities that did business with the Biden family, with a specific focus on Hunter. The effort coincides with an imminent decision by federal prosecutors over whether to charge Hunter with tax crimes and lying about his drug use when he bought a handgun. ... This committee, at least so far, is cheapening the use of whistleblowers because they keep saying that they have found all this evidence ... but where is it? Maria Cardona Although Hunter never held a position in the White House, his membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy”. There are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way. The White House has dismissed his investigation as “yet another political stunt”. Spokesperson Ian Sams said: “Congressman Comer has a history of playing fast and loose with the facts and spreading baseless innuendo while refusing to conduct his so-called ‘investigations’ with legitimacy.” Kyle Herrig, executive director of the Congressional Integrity Project, a watchdog monitoring the Republican investigations, suggests that Comer is abusing the term whistleblower. “If they have a whistleblower that’s what he the public would be interested in but, other than them talking about it, I haven’t seen anything materialise from that,” he said. Comer’s office did not respond to a request for comment or further details.</body>

    <head>Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action</head>
    <body>1) Brighton are an inspiration Sean Dyche was asked about the difference between preparing for Manchester City, Everton’s opponents on Sunday, and Brighton, whom they had clattered 5-1 in midweek. He observed that City play in various ways whereas Brighton have a particular method – and how well it’s serving them. Roberto De Zerbi has done an incredible job since replacing Graham Potter, all the more so as he’s refined their style mid-season. Next season, though, he’ll be facing opponents who know what to expect having seen various tactics deployed against it – and in all likelihood, will have European competition to contend with having lost a big player or two to richer rivals. So there’s a lot of work for the club to do: identifying replacements, signing reinforcements and developing different ways of playing. But in the meantime, their destruction of an admittedly tired Arsenal is just the latest evidence of an almost perfectly run football club; one that should inspire others at every level. Daniel Harris Match report: Arsenal 0-3 Brighton 2) Could Gündogan follow Arteta’s path? Ilkay Gündogan has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona this summer and, with a Sergio Busquets shaped hole in the newly crowned La Liga champions’ midfield next season, his versatility, talent and work rate would be a perfect complement to the young guns of Pedri and Gavi. Should City win the Champions League this season, Gündogan will have nothing left to win in Manchester, but one thing that could entice him to stay is the opportunity to continue his coaching – he has already taken training sessions at City’s academy and Mikel Arteta’s graduation from Pep Guardiola’s assistant to Premier League manager shows what can be achieved. At 32, Gündogan is in the autumn of his career, but his future still likely depends on a long-term strategy. Michael Butler Match report: Everton 0-3 Manchester City 3) Garnacho continues to sparkle It feels as if Alejandro Garnacho can be the next star in a Manchester United constellation that already features Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford, Casemiro, Rafaël Varane, Lisandro Martínez and Luke Shaw. After coming on against a doughty Wolves side, the forward punched a hole in the visiting rearguard, took aim and, with a sniper’s eye, fired the ball where Dan Bentley had no chance: on to the Wolves goalkeeper’s left post and in. Garnacho has delivered similarly telling contributions this season via winners at Real Sociedad and Fulham and the assist for Marcus Rashford’s decisive goal against Manchester City at Old Trafford. Garnacho’s return, after injury, at the business end of United’s chase for a top-four finish could be crucial: that points to how menacing the 18-year-old, who was lining up against Barrow in the Football League Trophy in October, has become. Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester United 2-0 Wolves Adama Traoré and his Wolves teammates react to Alejandro Garnacho’s moment of class. Photograph: Jack Thomas/WWFC/Wolverhampton Wanderers FC/Getty Images 4) Is the Age of Kanté coming to an end? After the news that N’Golo Kanté has picked up yet another muscle injury, it is hard not to wonder if it is time for Chelsea to say farewell to the midfielder. Nobody, of course, is doubting Kanté’s quality. He has been outstanding for Chelsea, who were poor without him during their 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest, and they are a different side when he plays. Yet his injury record is undoubtedly a problem. Kanté, whose contract expires at the end of the season, has been struggling for four years. The setbacks keep coming and Chelsea need to make a call on the 32-year-old, who is unlikely to play again this season after suffering a groin injury last Friday. But it is a conundrum. Kanté is still effective when he is fit, so can Chelsea afford to lose him and see him thrive elsewhere? Maybe not but, likewise, they cannot rely on him and his wages aren’t cheap. Jacob Steinberg Match report: Chelsea 2-2 Nottingham Forest 5) Saints show how not to fight relegation A club statement released on Saturday evening was signed by “Dragan, Henrik &amp; Rasmus”: Dragan Solak, Henrik Kraft and Rasmus Ankersen, partners in Sport Republic, Southampton’s owner. “We are particularly saddened and frustrated that our first season as controlling shareholders has ended in relegation,” it began, before a call for unity, for lessons to be learned. Southampton’s 2022-23 season can now serve as a case study on how to get relegated. Three different managers, of whom the best performer, Ralph Hasenhüttl, still averaged less than a point per game, and shocking transfer business will lead the bullet-point findings. Rubén Sellés’s team sagged against Fulham, too many points surrendered by poor defending and blunt forward play in previous matches. Sport Republic’s takeover last January cost £100m, with a further £63m invested since. The ownership trio promise to lay out their plans for a now-distressed asset at the season’s end. After Nathan Jones and Sellés, a capable manager would be a good start. John Brewin Match report: Southampton 0-2 Fulham 6) Howe shown football’s ugly side Former Newcastle managers, most notably Rafael Benítez, Alan Pardew and Steve Bruce, were frequently seen out and about in the city’s suburbs, doing supermarket shops, eating in restaurants and, in Bruce’s case, walking his dog. Mostly they were left alone but conversations with locals proved invariably polite and friendly, so it is a shame that Eddie Howe lives a more reclusive life, with Newcastle’s manager sometimes even leaving his house in disguise. Let’s hope the shock at being shoved in the chest by a Leeds fan who invaded the technical area during Saturday’s tumultuous 2-2 draw at Elland Road – featuring three penalties (one missed) and a red card – does not further heighten Howe’s anxiety. It was, mercifully, an extremely rare incident. Infinitely more common is Tony Mowbray’s recent experience in a Yarm coffee shop where two passersby spied Sunderland’s manager through the window and immediately bought him good-luck cards. Louise Taylor Match report: Leeds 2-2 Newcastle 7) Emery crafting another gem in Ramsey Jacob Ramsey scored in Unai Emery’s first match in charge of Aston Villa, a 3-1 win over Manchester United in November, and the 21-year-old homegrown midfielder has impressed since regaining his place after injury, shining alongside Douglas Luiz and John McGinn. Ramsey’s younger brother, Aaron, who has excelled on loan for Middlesbrough this season, was in the crowd at Villa Park on Saturday as he opened the scoring en route to a deserved victory against Tottenham. Emery gave debuts to Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith Rowe while at Arsenal and Ramsey is the latest youngster to flourish on his watch. “When he [Emery] was first appointed, the trophies and teams that he’s managed, speak for themselves,” Ramsey said. “He’s really confident and really demanding and it affects us players in a good way and we’re showing that now.” Ben Fisher Match report: Aston Villa 2-1 Tottenham Jacob Ramsey has praised Unai Emery’s effect on his game.

Though, on the face of things, 12th seems all right, they went out of both cups in the early rounds and flirted with relegation for much of the winter when, with the players they have, they should have done much better. In particular, 37 goals in 36 games represents an egregious disgrace for a squad boasting so much attacking talent, but in recent weeks they have started scoring – since they appointed Roy Hodgson in fact, and who saw that coming? In that time, Eberechi Eze – again the star against Bournemouth – has shone, his second goal an absolute ripper. He won’t, though, put those away often; what matters more is his ability to take the ball under pressure, commit defenders and make intelligent decisions, looking beautiful in the process. If he can bring his average level closer to his top level, he will be a very serious footballer. DH Match report: Crystal Palace 2-0 Bournemouth 9) Mbeumo gliding out of Toney’s shadow Bryan Mbeumo is a lovely footballer, one of the game’s gliders. Largely from the right, he cuts inside and out, only using his stepover when appropriate. Ivan Toney’s brilliance is always heralded but the numbers point to Mbeumo being a worthy supporting actor. He has missed just three of Brentford’s 74 Premier League games, with 68 starts bringing 24 goal involvements. And aged just 23, Mbeumo is yet to peak. “Bryan is sometimes going a little bit under the radar – I think he’s a fantastic player,” said Thomas Frank, Brentford’s head coach, after the win against West Ham. “I think he could have scored more in terms of probably being a little bit unlucky in some situations. Plus the importance for us in pressing and defensive work, he works so hard for the team.” Sam Dalling Match report: Brentford 2-0 West Ham 10) Arteta must pick new signings wisely To see Arsenal run over by Brighton wasn’t a massive surprise – Manchester City’s win at Everton in the early game, and the manner of it – forlorn hope, dashed in minutes – must have hit them hard. So now, with the league almost gone, they’ll be thinking about how they can improve for next season, because things are going to get tougher as rivals improve. What Mikel Arteta needs, aside from a midfielder to go into his first XI, is depth – but not stands-ins or rotation players, rather those good enough to challenge for a full-time spot. One of the main reasons City are going to win the title – at least – is that Pep Guardiola can tailor personnel to opponents and make impactful changes both during and between games. Arteta, on the other hand, has had to rely on more or less the same team playing more or less the same way, and though he won’t have unlimited funds to close the gap, he should have enough to make a difference – provided he picks wisely.

    <head>Can a bath in epsom salt help me get more beauty sleep?</head>
    <body>The hack Following Jennifer Aniston’s lead by making a bath in epsom salt part of your daily wind-down ritual. The test Sleep is crucial. I don’t have insomnia, but my brain does fire into anxiety mode right before bed. And actually making myself go to bed can be a battle too. But I’m hoping Aniston’s epsom salt bath solution could help. Epsom salt, also known as magnesium sulphate, is a completely different chemical compound from table salt. Studies are pretty scant on whether the skin really can absorb magnesium, but it is known to be a muscle relaxant and to help the brain produce the neurotransmitters that reduce stress an induce sleep. Related: Can putting petroleum jelly on your teeth help you smile longer? So I tried the recommended three baths over a week to see if it could help me sleep. You simply run a warm bath, add about 500g (shopping hack: TK Maxx often has cheap epsom salts) and soak for about 20 minutes. I definitely felt much calmer on the nights I took the baths, and noticeably more laid-back. It could just be my skin releasing endorphins in warm water, which obviously helps, but with the epsom salt I felt an extra level of chill. The verdict Try it. It could be a placebo (maybe it’s just the bath?) but I found adding the salt helped reduce my anxiety levels. Now, if only something could help me wake up in the morning …</body>

    <head>Isle of Man to grow cannabis business to diversify economy</head>
    <body>The Isle of Man has for decades been dominated by offshore financial services, but now its government is planning a push for a new kind of economic growth: medicinal cannabis. The British crown dependency is hoping to license as many as 10 firms by the end of 2025 to grow and export medicinal cannabis products from the island as part of a strategy to spur development. Tim Johnston, the Isle of Man’s minister for enterprise, said the island’s government was “really looking to diversify our economy”, and that encouraging a medicinal cannabis industry was one aspect of a plan to nearly double GDP by 2032, create 5,000 more jobs, and give younger Manx opportunities on the island. Johnston said: “We recognise we’ve got an older population. We’re keen to see that change.” The island in the middle of the Irish Sea has a population of 84,000, and an economy that has long left behind sectors such as fishing in favour of financial services. Insurance is the largest sector of its economy, accounting for nearly a quarter of the £5bn annual output, while the next largest is gambling: island firms offer “white label” services to essentially lend their licences to non-UK companies. It is also judged as a tax haven and a financial secrecy jurisdiction by tax campaigners. The Tax Justice Network judges that financial flows through the territory cost other countries billions of pounds every year in lost revenues. Related: Former Isle of Man chief medic sacked for whistleblowing is awarded £3.2m Johnston rejected criticisms of the role of the Isle of Man’s financial services industry in the global economy, saying the island has strong regulation and transparency. However, he said there was overwhelming support for looking towards medicinal cannabis and other industries as the government seeks to increase the island’s population to 100,000 over the next 15 years. He said: “As a high-value, low-volume manufacturing business it fits well into what we need to do on the island. We need to make sure when things are exported they are high value.” The government issued its first conditional licence to the startup GrowLab Organics last year. One oddity is that licensing is being handled by officials sitting under the island’s gambling regulator, as the government decided it would be quicker than setting up a new body. Cannabis-based medicinal products – which are mainly prescribed for chronic pain – were legalised in the UK in 2018, after similar moves in much of Europe, Canada and several US states. There is no sign yet of recreational cannabis being legalised in the UK, although it is legal in some US states, Canada, Uruguay and the Netherlands – a list soon to include Germany. Only specialist doctors can prescribe the drug in the UK and all companies selling it have to meet the exacting requirements of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Isle of Man producers will not have a free run at the UK market. The island is following in the footsteps of Jersey and Guernsey, two other crown dependencies, in legalising medicinal cannabis cultivation. Growers will also be up against rivals in regions where the drug has been legalised, including California and Canada, where the industry boomed before a spectacular bust. Producers will also compete with a handful of UK companies which have gone through the arduous process of gaining Home Office approval to produce medicinal cannabis. GW Pharmaceuticals was the UK pioneer before being bought for $7.2bn (£5.7bn), while Celadon Pharmaceuticals this year won the ability to sell cannabis oil in the UK. Phytome, based in Cornwall, is focusing on researching and extracting compounds from cannabis plants, rather than selling to pharmacies. Another UK startup is Dalgety, which is part way through the 14-week growing period for its first batch of plants in Staffordshire. James Leavesley, Dalgety’s operations director, cited a recent poll by YouGov – commissioned by a medicinal cannabis clinic – that estimated 1.8 million people in the UK use illegal cannabis for medicinal purposes such as pain management or anxiety. Dalgety wants to give those people an option to buy a safer, consistent, regulated product rather than relying on street dealers, he said. Dalgety said: “The key challenge for the industry is to let people know that there are legitimate routes and safe routes. The bottleneck is the awareness for doctors as well, to know there are a lot of people choosing to self-medicate for it. They have only ever known it as a bad thing.” GrowLab Organics on the Isle of Man hopes to export 15 tonnes each year. It has applied for planning on the island to build a growing facility. Once that facility is built it will qualify for a full licence, provided it meets defined criteria. The dried cannabis flowers would largely be used in vaporisers, to be inhaled by patients. One of the island’s main advantages was “to be legislatively agile”, said Alex Fray, one of GrowLab’s founders and an Isle of Man resident for almost a decade. “It has to keep reinventing itself to survive.” “This is a really unique scenario where you have a very deep, liquid market for something, but it’s illegal,” he said. “That transition from illegal to legal is very, very rare.”</body>

    <head>A case of heartbreak? I prescribe Tracey Emin’s neons and Paula Rego’s dancers</head>
    <body>Last Thursday night I gave a talk at the Hirshhorn in Washington DC. I always stick around afterwards so I can chat to people about their work, their favourite artists or their routes into art. On this occasion, one woman – her eyes glassy – looked at me and said: which artist can I look at to soften heartbreak? I immediately directed her to Tracey Emin’s neons, where I’ve often gone to find answers. Text is powerful when used in art. Emin’s neons, lit up in fluorescent colours and at times loosely framed in a heart-shaped line, have read: “Meet me in heaven and I will wait for you”; “It’s a crime to live with the person you don’t love”; “The soul will always do what it needs to do’’; “I could have really loved you”; “Be brave”. Although not limited to heartbreak, these lines address experiences most people can relate to. The places we go, or the people we look to in times of any need were on my mind that day. I had started reading A Life of One’s Own, a new book by Joanna Biggs, which explores nine female writers – from Mary Wollstonecraft to Toni Morrison – who have had to “begin again”. In the first chapter, Biggs tells us about her heartbreak after she and her husband separated and the way that she looked to writers to guide her in her new life. She recalls tender childhood moments when her mother would direct her to books: “The Mill on the Floss when I was ill; Ballet Shoes when I demanded dance lessons; A Little Princess when I felt overlooked.” With her mother now diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and “fading from my life”, Biggs goes on to ask: “How could I find the books I needed now?” I like to find solace in art – and the power of great art is its ability to speak to any of us at any time. Like Biggs, we have all had to renew ourselves, whether after losing loved ones; recovering from illnesses; moving jobs, cities, countries; or sacrificing or shedding something else in order to start something new. When I was going through a time of transition, someone advised me to curate a mini exhibition of works to help me understand how I felt. Opening up an empty Google Doc, I started with Paula Rego’s The Dance, a 1988 painting set under a moonlit sky that shows the different stages of a woman’s life. We see her dancing as a child, holding hands with her middle- and old-aged self; pregnant with her partner; with her back turned towards us as her lover’s gaze suspiciously meets ours – as if he is telling us something she doesn’t know; and alone – bigger and stronger than the rest. Stages of life … Paula Rego’s The Dance. Photograph: Malcolm Park/Alamy There was Gluck’s Medallion (YouWe), from 1936, one of the first Sapphic portraits in western art history that captures the union between two female lovers. Gluck, nearest to us, appears tense, whereas Nesta – basking in an auric glow – seems unattainable as she looks elsewhere. It’s as if Gluck is trying to immortalise their relationship, holding on to something that perhaps has now been lost. For me, this artwork symbolises heartbreak. In Mother and Child (2016) by Njideka Akunyili Crosby, we see a woman in a state of reflection. Facing the same way as the viewer – with her back turned towards us – she could be looking downwards or at the picture in front of her, which depicts a mother and child. Is she remembering the love of her own mother, is she pregnant herself or is the painting about something that lives inside all of us? And then there were the spiders by Louise Bourgeois, which appear in her sculptures, prints, drawings and paintings. Bourgeois, whose parents refurbished tapestries, admired the spider for its ability to weave a web from its body, which it could endlessly rebuild: “I came from a family of repairers. The spider is a repairer; if you bash into the web of a spider she doesn’t get mad. She weaves and repairs it.” Whatever you might be feeling, make a bookshelf of the writers who speak to you most, compile your favourite poems, go to your local gallery to experience art in the flesh or curate your own mini exhibition that will help you get through. Look to art for the answers because across the years, decades, or centuries, in work by someone who lived a completely different existence to you, you’ll find something you instantly recognise. And when you do, you can pass it on to someone else who might need it too.</body>

    <head>Bella Hadid’s regrets about her teenage nose job mirror my own. But now I have a new role model</head>
    <body>In a move that can be sincerely described as “Cher-Adjacent”, I was once placed next to Cher’s best friend at a dinner. Because I am a human with a heart, I love Cher. Furthermore, because at school I was viciously bullied by pale, blond girls for being too identifiably ethnic, I really love Cher. Beyond her genuine talent – a Grammy, an Emmy, three Golden Globes and a Best Actress Oscar to prove it – two things remain key about Cher: one, her look was seen as pioneering, the first Armenian-American pinup until Kim Kardashian. Second, her iconic political posts on Twitter, where she rails against sexist double standards (as she always has, via all the mediums that have evolved through the decades of her stardom). When sat beside her best friend, I had just sold my first screenplay, and couldn’t help but ask something my mother and I had spent years discussing: do you know who did Cher’s original nose job, the one she has in Moonstruck? So that’s how I ended up, in my early 20s, going to the doctor said to be the “ethnic rhinoplasty specialist”. If you had a bump, he kept some of the bump and he’d lift the tip, but only by degrees. He gave you the nose you already had, the next size down. Most people never know unless I tell them. I began to percolate on rhinoplasty and activism and not getting caught out, after the supermodel and Palestinian rights activist Bella Hadid discussed with Vogue her regret at having her nose done aged 14, telling Vogue: “I wish I had kept the nose of my ancestors. I think I would have grown into it”. I thought about how much Bella Hadid’s “before” pictures looked like my Jewish nose from teen photos. Who would have predicted in 2500 BCE, when the Hebrews settled with other Semitic-speaking people in Palestine, we would one day be caught in a cycle of violence over ownership of land, and that those who made it to America would give away the same nose. Bella Hadid frequently recalls her teenage self-loathing. It is quite a cultural headfuck to be, for this generation, the most emulated model on the planet, and also represent to them the permanent psychic wound of being the “ugly sister”. A kind of magic, like Philip Roth noting how, with Irving Berlin’s White Christmas, a Jew took the death of Christ and made it about the weather. In the US, where Hadid and I spent most of our adult lives, Arab and Jewish refugees petitioned to be granted “white” status in the census – before they succeeded, both groups were classified as non-white. On making it to the American middle class, many of my Jewish, Arab and Iranian girlfriends had rhinoplasty as a generational expectation. If the country your people fled to for survival is unsure whether you belong in the white category or the brown category, plastic surgery can be a subconscious reach for safety. As the writer Bess Kalb described well in Nobody Will Tell You This But Me, a biography of her Grandmother, she wanted Bess to have her nose “fixed”, as she had after fleeing the Nazis “In a fickle environment where there are active would-be Nazis in government, I understand why the protection of being subsumed into legal and cosmetic whiteness draws people in,” says Dr Maysan Haydar. Dr Haydar is a professor specialising in 20th-century immigration and acculturation patterns from Muslim-majority countries – but she’s also just a New York friend who didn’t judge me when I was 23, recovering from rhinoplasty. I didn’t have to spell out how humiliating it is to be vain, to want to fit in, but also to want to get away with things. In fact, many years later I returned to the surgeon after lip filler became a thing, but he declined to do it, saying: “You’ll go back to England, and people will be able to tell and they’ll laugh at you.” Bella Hadid was mocked on social media for uploading a video to Instagram of herself crying for the Palestinian people. This is unfair. All interesting people reach for two things that exist in opposition, and that tug, whether lover or movie star or model, is what makes us look at them. That Gene Kelly can dance with an animated mouse and have stood up to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. That Bella Hadid can film herself crying tears for the Palestinian people that fall in a different way than if she had the original Palestinian contours of her face ought not make them dismissible. I say from my own experience: the thing I clung to most, that got me through at a time when I had low self-esteem, felt lost and worthless, was that I came from people who suffered terrible tragedy but continue to struggle and continue to exist. And yet it doesn’t pass me by that two of the world’s most famous women from my tribe didn’t touch their features: Barbra Streisand and Amy Winehouse. Marisa Abela, the actor who will play Winehouse in the new biopic, has an Arab father and a Jewish mother. And a beautiful, untouched nose. The kind Bella Hadid lamented she would have grown into. Abela, recently starring in Industry, happens to have my favourite face on TV right now. What am I so transfixed by? Her own visceral liveliness and struggle, plus her very visible ancestry, the carrying, with her own youthful glow, what came before her. She is two things at once, a magic trick – like being an ugly-sister supermodel, or making Christmas about the weather.
